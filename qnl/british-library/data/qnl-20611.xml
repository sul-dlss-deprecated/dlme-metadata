A financial house in London are contemplating applying for oil concessions covering the State of Abu Dhabi and liie State of Dubai on the Oman Coast, but before making an application they instructed me to be sure that there was no danger of such action conflicting with the policy of His Majesty's Grovemment in the areas mentioned above. And if you indicated that such appli cation would be undesirable then the whole business would be dropped and no further action taken. As you informed me that you did not wish to give a conclusive answer to the above point but would consult His Majesty's Government on the matter, therefore I find that the correct course for me to persue is to when I return to London, inform my people of the position ana arrange that the whole question be taken up with the India Office, It would help matters very much if the discussion with the India Office took place during the time that you were in London. at this moment to disclose the names on behalf of whom I write.

Some of the letters were sent with NASIR BIN MUHAMMAD AL MAN1' of star. UDSA1N lATIM also usea to send letters on behalf of ilajor Holmes which he used to give to one Ibrahim Bahzad to enclose in his cover to his brother MAHalUB BAHZAD who works as a doctor at Doha.

A special messenger was employed to carry the It^^ers 10 i;oha. Major Holmes then applied to the Bahrain G-overnment for permission to come to Bahrain which was not allowed. Latjber HUSiilN lATIM arranged with HUSAIN KHALPAN, the ex-Secretary of Manamah Baiadiyah, ai uer ne linished his term of imprison^ient, to go and me^jor Holmes . t Lasrah an^ g^'instructions irom aim. 'ALI BIK hiJSAIN left Bahrain by the up stefcmer on 14.3.1935 and returned by air on the 21.3.1935 after meeting Major Holmes. The latter gave him his passage money ana Es.500/- in order to work for him about oil concessions. As soon as he returneu to Bahrain, he began to correspond with MUHAMMAD Al BAKIR ana usea to send their messages with a special messenger by name MUHAMMAD BW NASIE of Hfttar who was employed on tne launch working ior Mr.allies. As Major Hc^es could not come to Bahrain he sent his clerk to Banrain. Ashraf Najmuading Shamsuaain, clerk of *ajor nolmes, cam c from Kuwait by the dpwn mail0 -2' ,1 on 22.4.1935. As soon as he returned he began to make plans for v^atar etc. While the above arrangements were taking place in Bahrain Major uolmes wrate a letter to the Shaikh of Diuai which was sent Vith onF'MUHAMMAD BIN 'ABDUL UZK AL QATTAN a petty trader from Kuwait who takes vegetables and fruitb from Basrah to the Trucial Coast for sale. Major Holmes askea the Shaikh of Dibai to grant him permission to search for oil at JUBAlL(or JABAL ALI) which is situateu to the west of Dibai ana wnich is considereu to be the bouiiaary line between Abu Dhabi and Dibai. At the instance of the R.A. and X.G.Husain,the Shailch of Dibai went to Abu Bhabi in oraer to join in allowing Major Holmes to visit his place. As soon as the Shaikh of i^ibci returnee from Abu Dhabi a verbal message ;vas sent to Major Holmes to send some one on his behalf to discuss matters with them therein 22.5.1935 !

A special launch was also arr n ;ea to t^Ke him on tne 2^.5.1935 to Qatar ana thence to iibu Dhabi and Dibai. As Ashraf could not get an endorsement from here he left by the up steamer to Kuwait on which KUHAMUAD AL QATTAN, Wiio carried their mesaeges to the Shaikh of Dibai, was travelling.

The Anglo -Persian Oil Conpany, who are the only other British oil concern interested in the Trucial Coast, can obtain a concessior there only on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, who of otfurse are by no means wholly British* On the other hand according to what Major Holmes says in his let er --e o^erat- ing Company which will be formed by his Group to v/ork concession obtained would be from 80-100 per ©cent British, both as to capital and share holding personnel. 4 # With reference to paragraph 3 of my Express Letter No# / 336-S, dated the 27th Ajr il 1936, the General Manager of the Anglo-Per si an Oil Company has informed me that the S -ai a o Ras al Khaimah's request for the visit of a geologist to Ras al Khaimah is receiving the Company's urgent considerationo I have replied hoping that the Company will take a decision very /0 -3- 1 very shortly and stressing the beneficial psychological effect such a visit would have. sd.

My dear Fowle, Many thanks fov your letter dated the 23rd June. It has 'been very good of you to write in the teirris that you have done regarding Mylles and we are very much gratified not only at the successful outcome of these negotiations but also at the manner in which they were conducted. I fear that I shall not be able to take leave this year and so shall not have the pleasure of seeing you at Home. I trust however that you will certainly meet our^people at Britannic House, one of whom is now Mylles, and incidentally impress upon them the craze for the exploitation of their territories which is now possessing the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. You are of course aware that all this territory lies within the I.P.C. zone, and as things stand at present it is apparently extraordinarily difficult to get them to take any interest whatsoever in this part of the world. Thus for instance I had the greatest difficulty in persuading them to send a geologist to Ras el Khaimah in the immediate future and when they agreed I am forced to do their work for them and send one of my own men. I expect they will tell you in London, if you are not already aware of it, that the I.P.C. is proposing to form an exploration company,much on the same lines as our D'Arcy Exploration, which company shall be empowered by the several groups of the I.P.C. to negotiate and search for oil. The fomation of such a company will certainly simplify and expedite matters considerably, so that I trust its formation will not be long delayed. I hope you will have good weather and an enjoyable leave. ;Vith kind regards. Yours sincerely, Col. T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., Bushire.CONFIDENTIAL. No .C/402.

I don't think he would be very comfortable f ashore under present weather conditions.

I am glad to say tnat the Anglo -Persian Oil Company have at last arranged to send one ox their own geologists Allison - to visit lias al Khaimah at the end of this month. 1 understand that the delay was due to lacK c_ interest in this ire a by the Iraq Petroleum Company (unaer whom it falls and on whose behalf alone the Anglo -rersian Oil oompai^y can act). 2. In view of the strong foreign element in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and their lack of interest in this area, I feel that we should do all we can to encourage any group with a larger British element that is prepared to exploit the Trucial Coast. Have His Majesty's Government been able to ascertain the composition and intentions of the group behind Holmes ? (see paragraph 3 of my letter quoted a.ove). 3. Officially I hold no brief for Holmes, as you laiow J (though I li^e him personally) and I was for example mainly instrumental in hav ng him removed from his post as Chiei Local Representative in Bahrain, as I thought his presence there undesirable for v-rious reasons. But business is business and we should not, I think, allow either holmes 1 past / S.Laithwaite Lsquire ,C.1 .S., The India Office, Londod •vwiil | 0 -2- past history or that of Traders (who are probably his present backers) to stand in our way of assisting them. All that we are concerned with, so it seems to me, are the answers to the following questions s Are Holmes * backers 100% British or nearly so ? Are they financially sound ? Do they propose to work themselves any concession they can obtain ? If the answers to these questions are in the affirmative then it appears to me we should give them all the assistance we can* 4. The despatch of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company - Iraq Petroleum Company geologist to Has al Khuimah need not stand in the way of the policy suggested above. It binds neither the Iraq tetroleum Company nor the Shaikh and was pressed chiefly in order to forestall intrusion by any foreign , 2^; element e.g. the French (vide paragraph 2 of my nixpress '/ t w r Letter N0.336-S of 27th April 1936). xCven if the Iraq Petroleum Company pursue the matter further and eventually obtain a concession from the Shaikh this need not deter us from encouraging a British group to enter the lielu in respect of the rest of the tt*ucial coast. Sti ^ulatea the example of Bahrain, and more recently, of ^atar, all the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are now eager for the oil exploitation of their territories. Cole.

Date 20th July 1935. No. 30/S17. $o Tbe Honoura'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. (Copy to:- Political Agent, Bahrain.) During the exchange of calls with the ShaiKh of AIdu DhaM on 18th July 1935, the latter mentioned the prospect of finding artesian water and/or oil in his shailtfidom. The following account of the conversations is forwarded, at the shaiKh's request, for your information. S.- At first the shaiKh wished to Know the relative merits of the geologist at Kishm and Mr.Cox, who visited Abu Dhahi last December. On hearing that they were 'both considered to he good experienced men, he then asKed whether they compared with the American geologists who found oil at Bahrain. On this point he was reassured. 3.- The ShaiKh then went on to deal with events in this connection at Ahu Dhahi, He explained how Mr.Cox ( advised him that artesian water might he found at 200 feet and said that'later he had a visit from Idr.Williamson who pr edicted 100 0 feet, and assured the shaikh that his Company wouTd drill for him. 4.- It appears that this change of opinion did not impress the shaikh who seems to have felt that it was merely a clumsy attempt on the part of the Company to carry out test drilling for oil. He said that if water was available at both levels, he v /ould employ a contractor to drill to 200 feet first. In fact, throughout the interview, the Shaikh demonstrated clearly that he was no fool where his possible financial interests were concerned. 5.- About this stage, it seems that two letters from MajorHolmes of the Kuwait Oil Comfiany reached Abu Dhabi. TBelattsr, In a straightforward manner v/hich appears to have favourably impressed the ShaiKh, said he thought there was a chance of finding oil in Abu Dhabi territory, that if the shaiKh agreed he would send a geologist, and also mentioned that he was experienced in Gulf oil having found the deposits in Bahrain and Nejd. Major Holmes also informed the ShaiKh that he was prepared to come to Abu DhabiPage 2, ABU DHABI - OIL. (S.N.O.P.G's No.30/217 dated 20tlc\ July 1935.) Dhabi himself in raid-August, and to send a geologist at any tile of year. 6»- The ShaiKh, Who was under the impression that Major Holmes was an American, asKed whether he would 'be atile to conclude a private business agreement with him without incurring the wrath of H.EL Government. It was then pointed out that his Treaty engagements precluded him from granting any concessions of this nature without H'.M. Governments consent, and that an oil concession, liable to affect his whole shaiKhdom, could not be considered as a matter of private business. This view he professed to understand. 7.- It was further pointed out to the Shaiiih that Major Holmes was English, but had American partners, and that it was understood that he was now in London arranging for an entirely English concern. Also that unless Major Holmes had found such a company he would not be allowed to have any concession in Abu Dhabi by H.M. Government. 8.- Another point on which the ShaiKh appeared anxious was the possibility of Major Holmes 1 arrival in Abu Dhabi before permission was received from the Honourable the Political Resident to conclude an agreement. He was informed that Major Holmes would not visit the shaiKhdom without permission from the political authorities, though in view of Major Holmes 1 promise to come bacK in August it is not thought that he believed 'this. 9.- There seemed little doubt that the ShaiKh was optimistic as regards his territory being oil-bearing. He mentioned that bubbles of oil had been seen in the water around one or more of his coastal islands and that a tarry deposit had also been washed up on their shores. It was understood that these islands were situated between Abu Dhabi and Yas but the Shailih was most definite that no outsider should investigate without his permission. He complained of having been treated cavalierly in this respect by former A.P.0 .C investigators, and it is suggested that if the ShaiKh is treated with tact and courtesy in this respect, better results will accrue. 10.- To summarise, the ShaiKhr- (a) Wishes his territory to be examined for oil preferably by Major Holmes in whom he believes, but he is willing that an A.P.O.C. geologist should do this first, should P .R. so prefer, and no delays are entailed.

Whenever a ..moo merchant files a suit against his subjects the ^uaiiui uums a aeax ear hence it has been im^osbible for us to recover our outstandings, on the contrary we are reoukeu and humilatea, threatnea and return with filthy abuses heaped upon us.

This report struck us as interesting and we showed it to Ryan and asked him whether he had any observati ons. 2. Ryan is inclined to doubt very much whether Philby is in fact interested in prospective oil concessions. He admits that he may be wrong in this view, but he finds it in any case inconceivable that Philby should be working for such a purpose in conjunction with Major Holmes. Holmes is still persona ingrata in high Saudi circles, and only the other day Philby spoke to yan almost violently about his complete untrustworthiness. 3.

The name of the valley is I7adi Hijjil. 29th. Left Shimal accompanied by the Shaikh Sultan, his cousin Hamaid and his son Salim, via Heel to Gat. The whole distance from Shimal to Gat is about 3C miles, the road lies near the foothills and is one line of date garden v/atered by wells of sweet water. At Gat there are hot springs. ^11 along these foothills the water is good and plentiful, and only poverty and the want o- a near market keeps the people from cultivating larger areas. 3Cth. ,;e started to return to Heel.

Allison and myselfaccompanied by the Shaikh's cousin and son and several guards started on horse back towards the hills intending to explore one or two points, ./hen nearing the hills we were shown much hostility by the Shihu and decided to t . orego the visit to the hills and proceed straight to Heel. Later the Shaikhs of the Shihu overtook us and apologised for tie hostility shown by some of their tribe and wished us to return and complete our visit. This, as time was advancing and the noon heat intense, we decided not to do and so returned to Heel. 31st. ./e found the Shaikh had arrived last night and after visiting a hill near Heel we returned with him to his castle at Has-al-Khaimah. 1st August. This day the H.r.S.Lupin arrived and we embarked at about noon arriving at Bahrein on 3rd August 1935. i ■ ^xjoti ati oh s. From the time of our arrival to the date of our departure the Shaikh was very pleasant. Hot only was he keen to receive news of the likelihood of there being oil in his territory but also wishing to know if there were any likelihood of a good ground for boring artesian wells. Like most of these Shaikhs he seemed to think the Geologist had only to look at a place to say Just how much and how deep do /m the oil or 'v /ater was, and it took me all my tine explaining as well as J. could the difficulty and what -Lo exploration anc length of time were needed before an opinion could be expected from a Geologist. Later when we returned to Ras-al-Khaimah Mr. Allison infomed the Shaikh that he had not been able to form any opinion owing to the short visit and he suggested a further and longer visit by the D 1 Arcy Exploration in the cold weather. The Shaikh said hewas quite willing for us to visit him again. Up to this time he had made no mention of money or expenses, and it was only when he was asked to give us a written per mission covering two years and in it promising not to enter into negotiation with any other Comnany that he demanded payment, He said he wanted the same tems as we had given the Shaikh of Qatar (these teiros he had full information about from his Secretary who had Just returned fror: a visit to his relations in Qatar). After much talk we finally persuaded the Shaikh to give us a written promise addressed to the D'Arcy Exploration Coy. allowing them to explore his territories for a period of two years and agreeing not to enter into negotiation with any other company during that period with regard to search for oil or water prospects, also promising protection to the Company's employees whilst in his country. The conditions - or t :is promise were either that the Company bored several artesian wells in his territory or that they naid him Rs.750 per mensem during the period of two years. If we had not reauested the two years peraussion the Shaikh would not have asked for any payment. But, as he said, he xelt that if he was to be stopped from bringing in others who were perhaps keener on finding oil than we were we should pay him something for the delay. On the coast there is nothing secret; our movemerbs in Kuwait and ~atar, and the movements of others in Bahrein are known to the different Shaikhs almost as soon as they are carried out - and it was only by showing the Shaikh on the map what a much smaller territory his was in comparison with ruwait and Qatar, that he consented to accent a smaller amount than the amount he had been informed we had paid atar.IV competitcrs. Dubai has received a letter and also Abu Dhabi signed by rrank Holmes and offering them to bring his men in and search for v /ater and oil. In his letters he quotes the good work he has done for the Arabs in Bahrein and Kuwait and hints that only he could have found v/ater and oil in those places. Also he states that he is ./111ing to pay well ::or the pemission. I have not been able to see these letters myself but they have been shown to several and amongst them our Sharjah Agent Agha Husain ion .asan -vmad, who said that if required he thought he could procure a copy. od/- A .F. /illiamson.86/7 Telegram r # 27 H«M» Vice-Consul, Mohannuerah# To Political Resident, Bushire# B). 1300/19 Dated 19th received 20th August 1935.

The source of my information may be accepted as reliable. Shaikh Shaqbut on the voyage to Basra, gave out that he was suffering from ^Consumption^ (probably true), and that he was going to Baghdad to consult a specialist. In Basra he called himself Nasir al Abdul Latif, and it is believed he used this name on the ship also® ^ On landing at Basra, he at once went to the Maude Memorial Hospital, and became an in-patient there. 6# On 16th August, he left the hospital and after spending one whole day in Basra, left for Baghdad on 17th August (P.M.). 7 * Before going to Baghdad he discarded Arab clothes and a Ppeared in a complete set of European garments. He told my informant that he was on his way to see H.M.King Ghazi and that he ^oped to be received in special audience. q This statement that he was to visit the King, according 2iy informant, may have been made ; (a) In order to mislead anyone who might be keepingkeeping him under observation.

Shaikh Shaqbut quite candidly said that his presence in Baghdad was connected only with his health, and he appeared to be speaking the truth, for he clearly was very ill indeed. 5. On the question of Oil he confided to me that there were indications of it,and close to the torn of ^bu ^ftabi, also that Major Holmes had seme time back sent him two letters asking pemission to visit Abu Dhabi in connection with Oil, but that he had not replied to them. S. Shaikh Shaqbut added that Haji Abdulla Williamson cf the A.x J # C,C/. had also visited him a few weeks ago and had spoken with him about Oil, at some length and that he (shaqbut) had told him, that he preferred to have dealings and Negotiate with Major Holmes if any business in the 'Oil' line- 2 - 'Oil' line was going to be done. He lastly told me that he had only said what he did to Abdulla ./illiamson, in order to make the A.P.O.C. keen to come forwara and make him an offer, and that G-od willing the results would be good. anonymous• Note by Political A^ent, The reference to two letters sent by Major Holmes, must I think refer to letters sent w^en Major Holmes was last in Kuwait.

I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Lieutenant, Officiating Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain. !rpl Report of conversation with Hajji 'Abdullah Williamson, 11th September 1935# Williamson was in Bahrain en route to Abu Dhabi and. Dibai in order to negotiate for two year options on oil concessions. 2* He said that he had already been successful in obtaining an option for two years from Ras-al-Khaimah, for a payment of Rs.!750/- per month and that the Shaikh was pleased with the deal» 3. Hearing that both Dibai and Abu Dhabi were shortly coming to Bahrain, he had decided to wait until they arrived. He informed me that he had more or less full powers to complete negotiations on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with only one final reference to Head-quarters. 4. He went on to say that Abu Dhabi was definitely ill, suffering from gastritis, aggravated by worry. In this respect his visit to Baghdad was genuine. But there were also several relations of Husain Yatim and other agents of Holmes in Baghdad, who had no doubt been holding converse with the Shaikh. He complained of the parsimonious ideas of his Company, when compared with the lavish presents and extravagant promises of future payments always made by Hoimes when negotiating for oil. In fact, he aaid,/Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had tolu him personally that his offers compared very unfavourably with those of Holmes(Williamson had seen Abu Dhabi in Baghdad). 6. Further, Holmes has promised to start 'wild cat' boring immediately, whereas the Anglo-Persian Oil Company wish /-2- /-a/ wish to consider their options and tnoroughly explore their concessions before starting operations. This factor was alSJ© likely to increase his- Williamson^ - difficulties. V. His general demeanour was, however, fairly confident. o* He also serM that the Hasa Oil Company are likely to extend operations South iilast. 9# Khan Sahib T Abdur Razzaq^ in refetence to para 4, informs me uiat Husain Yatim has no relations in Baghdad.Ihe Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:— The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire# nc=.'»OENCV .1, ' No // f j and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s).

October 1935 Haj i V /illiaingon lunched with the Commanding Officer H.M.S.Lupin, 2. Haji Williamson had asked for an interview with me and asked whether we would send Khan Sahib Husain to Abu Dhabi to help him in his negotiations. I asked Haji Williamson if he had been to Abu Dhabi since the trouble in the Spring of this year. He said that he hfctd not but that he had met the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in Baghdad. He (Haj.i Williamson) thought that Khan Sahib Husain might be very useful to him in helping him to persuade the Shaikh to give him a concession for exploring. I said that 1 thought the position had changed rather since the trouble and 1 very much doubted whether the presence of Khan Sahib Husain would be any tiling but a hindrance to him. He&gt; however ^ was firmly convinced that he could help. 3. I could not tell Haji Williamson but two considera tions were in my mind (a) that it seemed doubtful whether at this stage a Government officer should go down with Haji Williamson and (b) that if Khan Sahib Husain were sent down on any such business he might well consider it as supporting any claim that he may put forward to the post of Residency Agent, 4. I finally told Haji Williamson that I would come to a decision after I had been to Abu Dhabi myself. 5. I told Haji Williamson that I thought it would be just as well for him not to arrive at Abu Dhabi while I was there. He quite agreed and said that he would not go for a few days. 5. Haji Williamson asked my opinion as to whether it would be wise to get an Exploration Concession from the Shaikhs /0 -2- Shaikhs of Ajman and Uirimf^al-Q.uwa in, said that it wes a matter for them to decide but that while the two areas were very small it might be Just as well to cover them if this could be arranged on reasonable terms. Kis idea was to leave them for the present lest they should demand the same terms as had been given to Ras al Khaimah and Sharjah, and that later on he should return to them and make Agreements for perhaps two or three hundred rupees a month. He thought that he would have little difficulty in coming to an agreement with Dibai but that with Abu Dhabi would be difficult, especially because of Holmes's communications with him, 6. He told me that Shaikh Shakhbut had certainly got hold of some money in Baghdad because cne day when he went round to see him he found him counting money which he thought was about Rs,4000/- • He thought that Shaikh Sha.khbut could iMbil^y have raised i*. a loan. He said that Sheikh Shakhbut did not frequent Qv the Sa 1 udi Legation but that he did go to^meals there. Shaikh Shakhbut was much worried over his health and the doctors in Basrah had told him that he had tuberculosis but examination in Baghdad had disproved this in favour of 1ong—continued and acute gastriti s.

About ten days or so ago I met &amp;ajor Holmes and told him that we were anxious to find out about his hundred per cent.

Major H. sai-i tnat he vvould approach his bacicers ; viiose naiies he still did not give^ and would communicate again either with me or with the India Office. I have heard nothing further, nor, I believe, have you. Last Monday, at the suggestion of Sir John Cadman, I met Mr. John Skirloss (I think that is how hi spells his name) of the I.P.C. Mr. J.s. gave me the following interesting information. Cwing to the difficulties which the British elements of the I.P.C. e.i*e having with their foreign colleagues, a new company was being formed. Ijbcactly what connection this company would have with the I.P.C. was rather vague, but Mr. J.S. iruormea me that it would be rather on the lines of the -' Arcj Exploration Company 9 which goes ahead and seekB concessions/@ ■ • 2 • concessions for the A.P.O.C. This new company, in which Mr. J.o. would, I gathered, play a prominent part, were going to get Major Holmes, if they could, to go to Koweit at some time in the future and approach the Sheikh on the subject of obtaining his consent to some sort of concession in the Neutral Zone. Mr. J.S. quite understood that tue &gt;jlioikh could give no concession without H .M.G. 's sanction and also that of Ibn Said. The second line of activity of this new company would be on the Trucial Coast. For this purpose Mr. J.S. said they had two negotiators in mind, one Mr. Hedgcock and the other a Mr. Chapman, and asked what my views were on these two individuals. I said that, as he knew, .r. .led-coc-k had been at Uascat as Financial Adviser at.d tnat I knew him very well, and that I did not tMm. that he would be quite a suitable person for the purpose in view, it. j .s. said that the conpany would therefore choose Mr. Chapman and bring him round some time to introduce him to the India Office and talk the tfiole inatter over# Before/— 3 — n u .before give tJieir sanction to eaay activitias oi' isiy oil eompaiy, whether the one proposed by Mr. J. 3. or any other, on the Truciai Coast, I t.h^v they should make the follov/lng terms i Vis-a- vis the Company ;- (a; that any geologist or eiaployee who visits any oi the crucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring the option should be of British nationality; (by that the exploring party in their travels wouli be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should go.

Sir Kdmund Davis and the Board of the Anglo- American Corporation of South Africa did not reach agreement as to certain points regarding the advisability of having one of the large Oil Groups in with them. I interviewed - on behalf of Sir Edmund Davis - two of the large Oil Groups but, as they were not inclined to entertain a participation in any such company, in the circumstances I see no chance of any further steps being taken in the matter of forming an all British company. I regret that this position has arisen and it now appears too much to expect to do anything in the Persian Gulf outside the orbit of the large Oil Groups. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

Sir, I have the honour to refer to ay conversation yesterday with Mr, J.G. yalton, at which I indicated that, subject to the approval of His Majesty* 8 Government, my Company, Petroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil ^pncessions in the territory known as the i Neutral Zone, the unallotted pert of Bahrein Island,'the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the Pirate Coast to Muscat* Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was registered as a private British Company on the lijth instant; the whole of its ehsres will 'be held by the same interests and in the sawe proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director. The concession recently obtained by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Huler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum concessions Ltd., together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty^ G-overnment; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to| Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a special sphere of influence of His Majesty* s/s.cxni Majesty's Government. There will also be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd« options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Rulers of Ras—el—Khaimah, Sharjah, Dubai and any other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Trucial Coast. The negotiations for the actual concessions will be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Ltd.* and in that connection it is proposed to employ Major Prank Holmes, who is acquainted with Persian Gulf matters and whOf to the best of my belief, can be entrusted to conduct such negotiations with proper obserrance of the customs of those countries. The terms to be offered will be based on the terms of the Qatar concession with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessions; the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated. The wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to the employment of British subjects in these areas will be observed, but I foresee possibly applying for special permission for the Company's Chief Geologist, Mr. N.E. «i.iii.iiihm«'i'*' 'ri-fin i im&gt;i ii, wkk Baker, an American citizen, to visit these areas to compile —I a report on their oil potentialities. The Company will comply with any instructions issued by the Resident or his representatives in regard to the movements, and for the protection of Geological reconnaissance parties. I shall be glad to hear whether these proposals are agreeable to His Majesty's Government and whether I may have/3. have permission to proceed on the above lines with the co-operation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who will be kept Informed of the negotiations.

I am not clear whether the letter to the General Manager -as intended as a copy for me, as it is not sealed by trie • lailai, or as an original for the General Manager, but I send the Arabic with a spare copy of the translation for him, as at the time I understood that it was intended that I should sen- it on.

The reference to Tanb Island may be important as the exploration agreement covers 'my country of Has al Khaimah* and I do not know whether this phrase was intended to include the island. I will try to clear up this point with Haji 'Abdullah Williamson, whom I may meet shortly at Abu Dhabi. In the meantime, I request that, if there is no objection, the letter an^ trr nslat ion for Mr.'Clkington may be forwarded to him and would suggest; (a) he be warned of the possibility of difficulties arising if any arrangement is ma.de with the Shaikh of Kalbah through the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, and (b) that he be asked what their views are on the subject of T^nb Island.

I had been given authority to offer Shaikh Shakhbut up to Rs.1,500/- to Rs.2,000/- per mensem for t period o' two years of the option. The Shaikh gave me no chance to negotiate by demanding twenty lacs of rupees for the two years option, thus politely driving me away.

'■'■'he story told me by IChan Sahib H usaln in Sharjah, and by the Shaikh and Ilaji illiamson (separately) that * Abdul Rahman was there on certain other business, sounded so truthful and came out so 'pat 1 that I could not help wondering at it I I have a feeling that Haji v illiamson probably said that if he (Khan Sahib -asrin) could not accompany him, why should not his relative; that Khan Sahib Husain jumped at it and sent 1 Abdul Rahman to remind the Shaikh of the cause of M ajor n olmes. This is mere surmize, but I let you know in case the Anglo-Iranian Oil Conpany ever suggest that we might have done more :or them. Haji illiamson would, of course, say that 'Abdul Rahman just happened to be there at the same time on 1 other business. durable '^tenant-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian a ulf.

WHITEHALL, S.». I. Important. 2_st November 1935 x 1 I enclose copy of a letter from J. Skliros Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company 9 regarding a proposed procedure for acquiring options 5 and subsequently possible concessions5 for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gull. Certain points in this letter were more fully explained at an interview which I had with kr. Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on 23rd October, 2c The reason for forming a company - Petroleum Concessions s Limited - separate from the Iraq Petroleum Company is 3 I understood;merely that the latter company has an Iraqi Government director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that he should participate in undertakings solely concerned with the acquisition of concessions in countries outside Iraq, Ijtarling, Esq., 3/ retroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, S.W.I- 2 - As regards the Koweit neutral z one, Petroleum Concessions, Limited are aware of the position of deadlock resulting from Ibn Baud's commitment to the Standard Oil of California, but they think that by the offer of an arrangement to facilitate the marketing of the Bahrein Petroleum Company's production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California Company to relinquish their stranglehold on Ibn Saud's part-interest in the Koweit neutral zone. With reference to the unallotted area of Bahrein, Mr. Lefroy did not think that this would be of value to anyone, but Mr. skliros was inclined to think that it might be worth while to obtain an option with a view to its examination. So far as I know, we have not entered into commitments with anyone regarding this area, so that vc is presumably open to any company which desires to do so to apply to the Sheikh for a concession (subject, of course, to His Majesty's Government's approval),, On the Trucial Coast the Anglo-Iranian Cil company (or the D'Arcy Exploration Company) have, as you know, already obtained tv/o-year options, subject to His/- 3 - 3: His Majesty's Government's approval, at Has al Khaimah Mr, Lefroy See papers enclosed with India Office ' rjah printed letters P. Z,5980, dated 2nd- ■ J/ thit September 1935, and P.Z.7001, dated 3rd I ' ed that tue y October 1935 o respectivelv ~ ^ ^ ) JUS1: ' obtain ed a similar option at Debai , They are also in the field for options at Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Uimi-al-Qaiwain. The Anglo- Iranian Oil Company would go forward with their pending negotiations, but any concessions for which they have acquired or may acquire options on the Trucial Coast would be negotiated and taken by Petroleum Concessions ? Limited» 6# The reference to the Pirate Coast is a geographical misunderstanding. Petroleum Concessions &gt; Limited, might interest itself in the possibilities of Muscat5 where we have not committed ourselves to anyone and the field is consequently open, ^s'ts-ted that certain preliminary conditions to the approval of options on the Trucial Coast (which had been discussed with Fowle during' his deputation) would be required by His Majesty's Government, viZo: V1 s-a-vis the C ompa nyi- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality5 (b)/0^ (b) that the exploring party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should gOo Vis-a-vis the Shei kh;- (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party* I added that another condition to the approval of an option would be that further approval by His Majesty's Government would be necessary before negotiations for an actual concession were e ntered .i nto with the Sheikh concerned 0 8. The question of our future policy on the Trucial Coast, which was discussed by the Middle East Committee on 24th September 5 has, of course, a certain relevance to the question whether in this backward and uncivilised area the acquisition of oil concessions by any company, of whatever nationality, ought to be encouraged or permitted» The result of the meeting' in regard to general policy was somewhat inconclusive, but there is, I think, nothing in the conclusions, such as they were, to suggest that we ought/- 5 - ought to ai-rive at a definite decision to sterilise the l— ••• _ Trucial Coast so far as oil is concerned. Indeed, the trend of the discussion was rather in the opposite direction, and Fowle himself, though he is averse from any new pronouncement of general policy, has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly impose an absolute veto on concessions which the Sheikhs may wish to grant, though specially careful conditions to safeguard the interests 01 His Majesty's Government and limit our commitments would be necessary. In any case, by stipulating that the actual commencement of negotiations for a concession, apart from the conditions on which it should be granted, will be subject to His Majesty's Government's approval, we shall, so far as is now practicable, ensure that each case is kept open for decision by His Majesty's Government, when the time comes, in the light of considerations of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concession would involve, £ ° 011 the question of nationality, it will be seen that the national complexion of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, is identical with that of the Iraq Petroleum Company. It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would probably beget separate companies to exploit the/(g) 1 ■ (0 the several areas in which they might be successful in obtaining concessions 9 but that such are the national jealousies on the part of the non-British elements in the Iraq Petroleum Company that there is no chance of such companies being lormed on a basis of a larger proportion of British ownership than that in the Iraq Petroleum Company itself. As 9 however, the areas mentioned (apart 5 possibly, from the Koweit neutral zone) are within the Red Line Agreement, it seems necessary to be content with the Iraq Petroleum Company's proportion of British shareholding, since no British company outside the Iraq Petroleum Company has shown a serious interest in these areas. Holmes has indeed been angling during the last xew months for the interest of an all-British group (which, however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I have now heard from him that his negotiations have definitely broken down, . : ^^ 0 Petroleum Department and the other Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Limited, as follows;- , (a)fOOn the Trucial Coast, subject to the conditions stated above. His Majesty's Government approve the options already/- 7 - already graiited by the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah 9 Sharjah and Debaij and any opt/ions 'that, may be granted by other oheikhs. If it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession 9 the prior approval of His Majesty's Government will be required before such negotiations are opened.^) In the event of such approval to the commencement of negotiations being given,, the conditions to safeguard Government interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would be considered and would have to be accepted by the Company before an actual concession v/as approved o (b) In Bahrein and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions ? Limited, applying to the rulers concerned 9 on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests,, (c) As regards the Koweit neutral zone* application vknmm may be made to the Sheikh of Koweit for an option for his part-interest in the zone ? on the understanding that 5 if it should later become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and Ibn Saud jointly^ the prior approval of His Majesty's Government would have to be sought before the/8 - the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone) as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests, ■^ o ^ will be observed that the Company propose to employ Holmes for the negotiations of actual concessions. Mr. Skliros explained that this proposal was made faute de It is of course primarily the business of the Company whom they employ and, subject to Fowle's views, we do not think that we need make any objection, 12 ' ^ Petroleum Concessions Limited should make the application, of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph cf Mr. Skliros's letter, for soecial ~ permission f or Mr. Baker to visit .areas on the Trucial Coast, we could consider in consultation with Fowle the question of making' an exception in that particular case irom the general rule suggested in paragraph 7(a) above, I ain sending* a similar letter to Rendel and Seal, and a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, to Air Vice- Marshal Courtney. We should be grateful if you could let us / /lM C 7) have/-have an early reply as we should like to let Petroleum CcncGSsions Limited have a reply to their enquiry as soon as possible. Yours sinoePdly. {&amp;&amp;,) J. 0. vV AiA.z. 7763/35 II I J si V 1 mmmmmm 3 INDIA OPPIGE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. ll-th November, 1933« 2ij.th ler 5 1935 With reference to the discussion in the Official Middle East Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on 2Uth September last, I thinK: that you will be interested in the enclosed ^opy of a letter from the Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum a &gt;-'■ (0 Company, and of a demi-official letter whi~h I have been y ^ authorised to send to the Poreign Office, Petroleum y Department and Admiralty, regarding the possibility (it is at present only a possibility) of oil concessions being granted on the Trucial Coast. These enclosures are, I think, fairly self-explanatory. You will see that the reply which it is proposed to send to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, provides safeguards at three stages. First, in approving the/ Air Vice Marshal C.L. Courtney, C.3., C.B.E., D .S .O. , Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Ministry, Kingsway, W.C.2.the optio ns which have been obtained or may be obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from the rulers of the Trucial Coast, we would lay down the conditions suggested in paragraph 7 of my letter. Secondly, in accordance with these conditions it would be necessary for the Company to obtain the further approval of His Majesty's Government before opening negotiations with any of the irucial Sheikhs for the grant of a concession. Thirdly, if such negotiations take place, we should, before approving any concession agreement that might be negotiated, impose such conditions as were necessary to safeguard Government interests in connection with the working of the concession. These last conditions would be incorporated in a separate agreement between the ^owpany and his Majesty's Government. a separate o-overnment agreement of this character was concluded in the case of the Xoweit and Katar oil concessions. i enclose copy of the Katar Agreement between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and His Majesty's Government c.nd its connected concession agreement, which are referred to in the third paragraph of the letter from Mr. Skliros and which show the sort of machinery which has been devised/ r&gt;;i1 ^ 3. devi&amp;ed for securing whatever Government safeguards are considered necessary in the case of any particular concession. m the case of concessions on the Trucial Co.st even more careful safeguards might be necessary than in the case of the Katar concession. When the time came they would be formulated in consultation with the Air Ministry and the other Departments concerned. We should be obliged if you could let me know whether the Air Ministry concur in the reply which it is proposed to send to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, m regard to the procedure to be followed with reference to that part of their programme which relates to the Trucial Coast.

Also discussed is the possibility of pursuing options to explore for oil in Ajman and Umm al Qaiwaim [Umm al-Qaywayn], and negotiations for a two year option in Abu Dhabi which is unsuccessful.Other matters discussed in the volume include:major Frank Holmes interest in exploring for oil on the Trucial coast, including his correspondence with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and his involvement in a new British oil exploration company which does not come to fruition;a trip taken by the Shaikh Shaqbut bin Sultan bin Said (Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān), Ruler of Abu Dhabi to Basrah [Basra] and Baghdad to seek medical advice, and rumours that he may also be discussing oil exploration whilst there;discussions held in the India Office regarding the British Government's future policy with regards to the Persian Gulf and the development of oil there; along with measures to be taken to safeguard British interests in the Gulf and minimise the additional workload that oil concession negotiations might add to the Political Residency;the formation of Petroleum Concessions Limited, a part of the Iraq Petroleum Company to manage non Iraqi concessions and pursue new ones. The intention was for the new company to manage the Qatar concession and to follow through exploration and negotiations for those areas that the D'Arcy exploration group had obtained options for as well as to look at possible concessions in the Kuwait neutral zone, the unallotted area of Bahrain, and the remaining areas of the Trucial Coast;possible interest by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in exploring Kalbah [Kalbā] and the island of Tunb [Greater Tumb] for oil and minerals.Other correspondents in the volume include the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf (Captain Vernon Saumarez Butler); and the British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah (also given as Khoramshahr) (Frederick Charles Leslie Chauncy) who relays correspondence and information relating to Persia, Iraq and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.The correspondence from the various Trucial Coast Shaikhs is in Arabic, with translations in English, and the letter-head for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is in Persian and English.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 254-268.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>D'Arcy Exploration Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geographical exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000285#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
