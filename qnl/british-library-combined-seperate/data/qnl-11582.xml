This incorporates Aden proper, the Aden Protectorate, and the territories of Yemen and Asir [ʻAsīr] governed by the Imam of Sanaa and the Idrisi.It provides a history of the administration and control of Aden; highlights the friction and confusion caused by the continued use of temporary arrangements made during the First World War; and asks by what authority Aden should be administered, and on what revenues the expenditure should fall. The pros and cons of transferring the administration to the Imperial Government is discussed, along with financial responsibility, and proposals made by the Government of India and Colonial Office. It includes a table showing the expenditure at Aden and its divisions between Indian and Imperial revenues from 1910 onwards.The memorandum was originally drawn up for the Secretary of State (Viscount Peel) in July 1923. A note has been added noting progress on the settlement one year later.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>Financial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000375#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
