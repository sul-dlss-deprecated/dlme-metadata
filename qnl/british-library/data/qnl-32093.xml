Would you please refer to my letter of the 20th January concerning the appointment of a Manager at huwa.it in succession to the late Mr.T.E.Patrick? As I informed you when I saw you on the 23rd, we have now provisionally selected for this post Mr.L,T.Jordan, whom the Gulf Oil Corporation of America have agreed to place on loan to us. You will be aware from our applications to you for visas that we have already engaged a number of American personnel for employment at Kuwait and that we were obliged to do this since we were unable to obtain, from amongst British subjects, persons who possessed the qualifications and experience judged by us to be necessary for certain technical posts. The appointment of a Manager to take local charge of our operations at Kuwait is, however, a matter of special importance and, before confirming our selection of Mr.Jordan, I feel that you should be aware of his appointment. You will, I am sure, appreciate that the magnitude of our development programme makes it essential that the post in question should be filled by a man of exceptional qualifications and experience if w^e are to carry through this programme successfully. In consider ing this matter I have, of course, had in mind our obligations under Article 3 of the 'Political Agreement'. It has not, however, been possible to secure from British sources a man of the requisite experience on the type of oilfield now being developed in Kuwait.From C.A.R Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-53/9 14-50 Mr.Jordan is a senior and experienced executive oi * 3 Gulf Oil Corporation and his knowledge of the peculiar problems associated with production from oil sand structures would he of special value to us. Mr.Jordan has already arrived in this country and I am naturally anxious that he should proceed to Kuwait with the minimum of delay. I should, therefore, he very grateful to receive your consent. / ■J t-v-c—j /r E.P.Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing S treet, S.W.l.From C.A.P Southwell Te L.OW»JtSWWGt»M XK(JcSS? 3 l Ambassador 1271. 20th January Since the death of Mr. T.S.

I should like an early opportunity of discussing this appointment with you and should be grateful if you would let me know a convenient time for me to come and see you. As the matter is of some urgency, may I suggest some time this week. Late Thursday afternoon or Friday morning are my best times.

Donaldson Esq., The India Office, 'Whitehal 1 , London, S.W. 1. Dear Mr. Donaldson, As I mentioned to you at our recent meeting, there is nn insufficiency of trained local man-power for the large develop ment we have on hand in Kuwait. In view of this position there, it is necessary to look elsewhere for our man-power requirements* and as there are experienced Indians in India available for recruitment by the Kuwait Oil Company, and as we have a number of Indians already in our employment in Kuwait, this source appears to be a good one for our purpose. I have already discussed this with Colonel Hay and Mr. Tandy, and they raised no objection. There will, of course, be a number of problems in connection with the employment of Indians in Kuwait, but I see no reason why these should not be satisfactorily overcome. We already require in Kuwait an Indian ''Yelrare Officer of the British Officer or Indian Civil Service Officer type, and also a recruiter in India who could be attached to our Agents in India, the Anglo-lranian Oil Company (Bombay), to work on our behalf in connection with our recruiting requirements. As there will be a number of Indian Civil Service personnel seeking emnloyment in the near future, I am wondering if you couldassist by passing my request to an appropriate office which might help me in this matter. Should any suitable candidates for these posts be available, I should be glad-to arrange for them to interview e senior member of the Kuwait Oil Company staff, a Mr. L.D. Scott, who will be proceeding to India on our behalf in connection with our problems about the end of January. I do not think that it is necessary for me to indicate at this stage the salary or-terms of employment as these would naturally depend on the qualifications and experience of the candidate. The two appointments are of importance to-the Kuwait Oil Company as the satisfactory organisation of the recruitment and welfare of Indian personnel in Kuwait is of vital importance to the completion of the various stages of the oil development project within the time limits which we have set.

I have disucssed the arrival of de '^rairup in Kuwait with Scott who fully realises that the necessary preliminaries were overlooked. He expresses willingness to send de Trairup back to Abadan, but states that to do so would hold up the Company’s work, already held up for many months through the inability, Scott states, of his principals at Abadan to supply a much needed man. 3* In the circumstances I wish to recommend that de Trairup be allowed t o remain in Kuwait and be permitted to begin his duties (Oarage Superintendent) at once, before the consent, if you decide to apply for it, of His Majesty’s Government (vide paragraph 3 of the Political Agreement) is obtained.

Sir, Sk lS. . ‘ ^ ; I % WV‘* \ 1 s# ■/VI We beg to request the consent of H.M.Government to ^ the employment of two surveyors of United States citizen- ^3 v ship as additions to the geophysical party which is now ^ operating in Kuwait* The individuals concerned are DENVER WAYLAIID MCCARTY born of American parents on ^Oth October 1910 at Sikes, Louisiana and DANIEL VAN SWEARINGEN CRESAP born on 22nd February 1912 of American parents at Segura, Louisiana. Both men are single and are employees of Gulf Exploration Company, one of the two shareholders in this Company. The reason for the present request is that, as you are aware, the Company is particularly anxious that the o ^ geophysical survey of Kuwait should be completed during^ the present cold weather. Information recently received from Kuwait shows that progress has been impeded by an insufficiency of surveyors. It is expected, however, that the addition of two surveyors to the party will enable the full programme to be accomplished. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has no surveyors whom it can spare for service in Kuwait.

We have now received advice from Gulf Exploration Company that one of the party - Mr. T. B. Pepper - has recently suffered from poor health and it is thought inadvisable that he should go to Kuwait. It is proposed, therefore, to send in his place Mr. Henry Clay Reichert whose personnel record is attached hereto. The Board would be greatly obliged if His Majesty’s Government would give their consent to this change. In view of the fact that the geophysical party intend to leave New York on 8th August, an early reply would be appreciated. Whilst we regret the necessity for this Ifst- rainute change, you will doubtless appreciate that it is thought best to send to Kuwait only those men in the best of physical condition. Treso.

The Americans have, as you point out, carried out a great deal of this kind of work in the United States, especially in the Gulf Coast area. The Anglo Iranian Oil Company would have been glad to furnish a quo ^a of British experts but unfortunately their geophysical staff is fully engaged and they have at present no one available who could be sent out to Kuwait.

C. 2. 3761 5 B &lt;H' 5.35 1 7 SEP1935 Dear Kemp, With reference to Laithwaite’s letter, No.P.Z.632/35, of 30th January last, on the subject of Article 3 of the Political Agreement between H.M.G. and the Kuwait Cil Company, and the question i of the employment by the Company in Kov/eit of persons who are neither of Koweiti nor British nationality, I write to place on record the position as it appears to us as the result of our meeting this morning at the India Office with Major Davids and yourself. Under Article 3 of the Political Agreement the employees of the Company in Koweit shall at all times, so far as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking ,b e British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit, but with the consent of H.M.G. persons of other nationalities may be employed if, in the opinion of the Company, they are required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. H.M.G. will, of course, in accordance with the terms of Article 3, not unreasonably withhold their consent to the employment of such employees of other nationality, but in order to carry out their responsibilities under Article 3 they will in practice expect to be informed on each occasion of/Of the special reasons which necessitate the employment of such other nationals and if possible to be furnished with sufficient particulars about them to enable them to make enquiry should they think this desirable. We assume that on such occasions the Kuwait Cil Company will address an official letter to the India Office requesting the consent of ii.M.G. to the employment in K owe it of any employees who are neither of Koweiti MDrTbritish nationality , and in our view S UHL ** the simplest procedure and the one which is least likely to cause delay in dealing with any application would be for the Company to include in their official letter a statement of the special reasons which necessitate the employment of such other nationals. £ The Canpany on the other hand have made it clear that while in practice they believe that no difficulties will arise between themselves and H.M.G. on this point, they would be reluctant to express their written concurrence in the procedure suggested above, since in their view an arrangement of this nature if concurred in by the Company would constitute an interpretation of Article 3 of the Political Agreement which they regard as unnecessary at the present time. The Company would therefore prefer that no hard and fast rules of procedure should be laid down at this stage/Department 633 stage but that each case of an application for the employment of non- Koweiti or non-British nationals in Koweit should be considered as and when it arises. 3. With regard to paragraph 4 of Laithwaite’s letter of 30th January, H.M.G. understand that once operations are started by the Company in Koweit the latter will see no difficulty in furnishing to the India Office periodic statement of their employees in Koweit, giving their names , nationalities, nature of employment and dates on which employment began, classified into various grades. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.) CLAUSON/f r c}}J DRAFT. 25.3.1935. Dear Laithwaite, With reference to your letter P.Z. 632/35 of 30 th January, I understand that the statement mentioned in paragraph 4 which is rendered to the India Office by the Bahrein Petroleum Company is a quarterly statement of employees in Bahrein giving their names, nationalities, nature of employment and dates on which employment began, classified into various grades. I am authorised to inform you that the Company are prepared to furnish such a periodic statement once operations are started by the Company in Kuwait. In this connection, however, my Directors wish me to say that, since your letter under reply undertakes to place on record certain observations with reference to procedure under the Political Agreement and that some of such observations are of such character that they might if concurred in by the Company constitute interpretations, amounting in some respects perhaps to modifications of that agreement, it is not to be implied that the Company concurs in such observations. My Directors feel that the provisions of the Political Agreement, having been carefully considered and framed, are quite clear and should be applied without previous efforts at general interpretation to cases as they arise; and they anticipate no difficulty in that respect. Yours faithfully.635 India Office. Confidential. P.Z.1732/35. KOWEIT OIL. Note of discussion with Kuwait 12th March, 1935. t* ■ Hft / ^ ^ ', 5. Oil Company on :.!f. Stevens and Mr. Kemp of the Kuwait Oil Company called at the India Office on 12th March to discuss Mr. Laithwaite’s demi official letter of 30th January (No.P.Z. 632/35) to Mr. Kemp regarding the employment of American nationals in Koweit, Mr, Laithv/aite and Mr. Crombie were present. Mr. Stevens said that he wished first of all to make it quite clear that he fully appreciated the position of H.M. G, in Koweit vis-a-vis American interests and the risk of possible agitation in this country and c onseciuent embarrassment to H.M. G. He had indeed been perfectly aware of the difficulties on the Government side during the latter part of the Company^ negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit. He could promise in the fullest and frankest manner, and without any reservations^that H.M. G, need have no anxiety on genuinely grateful to H.M.G. for having given them a fair deal. His principals in New York entirely shared his views on this question and were well satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations. Mr. Laithwaite thanked Mr, Stevens for this statement.636 - 2 - As regards Mr. Laithvjaite ’ s letter of 30th January X. Stevens said that the Kuwait Oil Company saw no Objection at all to furnishing full information to ’.M.G. regarding the special reasons for the employment )f any non-Koweiti or non-British employees. They were mxious however to avoid formal official correspondence is to the interpretation of the terms of Article 3 of the Political Agreement. Under the Article the ,! opinion Df the Company 11 was the determining factor on the question whether the employment of persons of other than British or Koweiti nationality was necessary for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking, subject always, of course, to the consent of H.K.G. The terms of Article 3 thus seemed perfectly clear and no further interpretations or refinements appeared to be necessary at this stage. In particular the Company *ould not like to agree to an interpretation vmich established the necessity for any particular ratio between the various nationalities employed. He suggested that the article as it stood was quite sufficient for the time being. If, at any future time, H.M. C. thought that the Company were being unreasonable in anj way. had only to let the Company know - preferably informally. If necessary it would then be possible to discuss the desirability of some modification of Article 3 of the Agreement. ttr. baithwaite said that in practice there seemed little, if anything, between H.M.G. and the Company on J _. u t- r reauired full information m this question. H.M.G. requu order to be able to judge whether British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh were being employed vjith/&lt;8&gt; 637 with Article 3 'so far a as was consistent with the efficient carrying on ox the undertaking' and to enable them to decide whether, if they were to withhold approval of the employment of an individual of another nationality, they would or would not be acting unreasonably. He mentioned that if full information were furnished there would be less likelihood that the disposal of any particular application vi/ould be delayed owing to the necessity for consultation between the various interested Government Departments. As regards the ratio between various nationalities H.M.G, merely wished to keep a watch on the numbers of the different nationalities employed. They had no desire to draft riders on the Political Agreement. Mr. Stevens repeated that the Company saw no objection to furnishing full information in connection with any application or to keeping H.M.G. informed of the strength of the personnel of various nationalities employed in Koweit and added that in practice H.M.G. would have no reason for dissatisfaction with the actual ratio between the various nationalities. It was agreed that Mr. Kemp should prepare a reply to the India Office letter of 30th January which could be pieviously discussed in draft, in which the Company would express their readiness to furnish full information J regarding the reasons for the employment of any non-British/ or non-Koweiti personnel, but would state that in their jj opinion it was unnecessary at this stage to enter into any further interpretation of the meaning of Article 3 of the Political Agreement.

C. 2. 22nd January, 1935• Dear Laithwaite, With reference to ray official letter of 17th January, I should have explained that Anglo- Persian Oil Company had already made geological surveys in Kuwait before the incorporation of Kuwait Oil Company. At least four A.P.O.C. geologists (including Mr. Cox) have examined Kuwait at various times. Gulf Exploration Company (the other partner in Kuwait Oil Company) have no independent geological information on Kuwait. The forthcoming geological expedition will be in the nature, primarily, of a reconnaissance. For that purpose one Anglo-Persian geologist would be regarded as sufficient, considering the information that Company already has. Should topographical work be undertaken by the present expedition, however, the two geologists which Gulf desires to send, and the one to be sent by Anglo-Persian, would be supplemented by others who would be supplied by Anglo-Persian.

There were present Mr. Laithwaite, jv.r. crornhie, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Kemp. ^ Company stated that they were anxious to secure approval for the despatch certainly of an jimerican subject, hr. Hhops, who was their head geologist and who hna previously conducted geological investigations in Bahrein, ana possibly, though this was not yet quite certain, of kr. Crowell, a topographer. They wished to know v/hether any objection would be seen and whether a formal application would be necessary to His Majesty's Government or whether the question could be disposed of informally. hr. Laithwaite referred to the terms of Clause 3 of the Company's political agreement of 5th torch 1934 and t0 the discussion which had taken place in connection wltil 1 ' fc * His Majesty's Government haa no desire unreasonably to withhold their consent to the employment m Koweit of persons who were neitner British nor Koweiti suojects and whose employment was essential for commercial reasons, but it would be appreciated that if they were to e ^ a position to exercise a check (and they attached hre^t importance to a strict observance of tne condition save where it was essential in the interests of efficiency/2 649 eliiciency, personnel shoula be British or Koweiti)thej must on each occasion on wnich it was desired to employ persons who were neither British nor Koweiti nationals oe informed of the special reasons for this and if possible furnished with some particulars about the individuals.

He suggested also that the company might be willing to furnish His Majesty's Government with a periodical statement showing the particulars and nationalities of all employees, on the same lines as had been adopted by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. Mr. Stevens saw no difficulty about the provision of such a roster at whatever interval might be thought desirable once operations started seriously, ana it was agreed that the procedure for securing the approval of His Majesty's Government to the employment oi persons who were not of British nationality shoula be that a formal written request should be put forward on behalf of the Company, giving particulars of the individuals in question, ana explaining the reasons which made it essential to employ them In preference P er sonnel of British nationality. 6/ N- mm.(G^) 650 - 3 - Tiis Company indicated that they appreciated that His hajesty' s Government would wish to keep a close watch on the proportions oT British and non-British personnel. For the moment, however, their operations would he merely exploratory ana the numbers affected would he so small tnat the Question of tne ratio seemed o± relatively secondary importance. Mr. Kemp explained that the A.P.O.C. had already conducted oil surveys in Koweit and felt that they had prohahly as much information as was really necessary; tnat the geological investigations wnich were now to take place were therefore primarily for the benefit of the Gulf Oil Company and conducted by their agents; and that this explained the apparent preponderance of American personnel. 28th January 1935.KUWAIT OIL COMPANY, LIMI'Mi).
