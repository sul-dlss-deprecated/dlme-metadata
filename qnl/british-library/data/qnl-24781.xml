Satisfactory alignment for road with maximum grade of 1 in 20 and possi bly a railway has been found passing through Urujan, Lurdegan, Bars and Malamir. Highest point touched is 7,600 feet as compared to 9,000 on Lynch road. Deducting difference of level between Chahar Mahal (Chigakhur ?) and Malamir, total rise and fall over mountain section is 10,000 feet as compared with 40,000 feet corresponding to figures Lynch road. Inner range is so crossed north of Malamir, at 4,000 feet and outer range, south of Urujan, at 7,600. It appears intervening distance of 75 miles, through heart of Zagros, alignment from that crosses not more than one pass. Proposed line is 20 miles longer than Lynch road but, from point 12 miles north-east of Lurdegan, where alignment attains its maximum south-easternly trend, it is only 80 miles to Shiraz-Ispahan road at Yezd-i-Khast via .Falad, Simirun by a track which is at present carriageable except for one low pass (about) 1,000 feet, east of Ealad. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram P., No. 38, dated the 25th February 1917. From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. I informed Foreign Office that Persian Transport Company was consider ing question of making Bakhtiari road suitable for wheeled traffic. Conversion XS6 F. &amp; P. D.2 1 of road to a cart road is contemplated by Lynck-Bakhtiari agreement, though road concession only provides for levy of tolls on pack animals. It is or con ' sideration whether modification of concession is necessary to enable tolls to be levied on wheeled Iraffic, and whether Russia would regard application of Persian Government for modification as an infringement of 1907 agreement. I have received from the Foreign Office the following reply : Begins. “ Russian Government might object if road actually terminated in Ispahan, as town of Ispahan is in Russian sphere. We might either ascertain whether Russian Government would object road ending°in Ispahan or endeavour to terminate road outside Ispahan. Either of these alternatives would meet difficulty. If road ended there, could concession be regarded as outside Russian sphere ? Possibly existing road is already in a sufficiently good state, for a few miles outside of Ispahan, to render continuance of work upon it unnecessary. I am advised that, in order to enable tolls to be levied on wheeled trans port, it is certainly necessary that application should be made to Persian Government for modification of concession.” Ends. A possible solution has been suggested to me on the following lines :— “ About three miles from Kharaje, on Lynch road, there is a track to Chigakhur about nine miles distant: and from Chigakhur there is already carriage road to Ispahan—99 miles in six stages. Difficulty might be solved, if it tv ere practicable to convert this track of nine miles.” Please let me have your observations on the suggestion contained in the last paragraph. Enclosure No. 3. Telegram P., No. 37, dated the 26th February 1917. From—His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran (repeated Basrah and Ispahan). There can be no question of a road passing through Kharaje or Chigakhur. Alignment recommended by me to Persian Transport Company lies, in almost its entire length, many miles south of Lynch road and must be looked upon as quite separate and distinct from caravan track. It is just possible to get a light victoria over the so-called carriage road from Chigakhur to Ispahan, but for heavy motor traffic it is not a business proposition. My alignment joins this road at Urujan, 60 miles from Ispahan, from the beginning of Ispahan territory. Over this section it will be necessary to con struct a permanent metal road. Of remaining 47 miles into Ispahan first 30 would be over plain requiring no clearance except clearing present track of stones in places. For remaining 17 miles a few culverts and some banking would be necessary. Road to Yezd-i-Khast would seem almost as necessary as that to Ispahan * Enclo. and it might simplify question to complete this branch first, vide my telegram * No. i ante. ^t 0&lt; £1, 11th February.

My immediately preceding telegram.f Transport rates are now 120 pounds a ton to Ispahan and more than a million sterling is being spent yearlyon transport over Lynch road. Even if normal conditions tvere restored, rates would remain unduly inflated. Our trade is likely to find itself very handi capped at end of war in Ispahan as well as districts to south unless something, is done. Enclosure No. 5. No. 375, dated Ahwaz, the 30th July 1917. From— Captain E. Noel, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahv/az, To—The Hon’ble Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., Chief Political Officer, Baghdad. I have the honour to submit a full report, with the marginally noted appendices and maps, on the question of the improvement of communication from Arabistan to the Persian plateau through the Bakhtiari country. You will recollect that, in January and February of this year, Mr. Sotham, the Persian Transport Company’s En gineer, examined an align ment for a motor road or light railway lying generally to the south-east of the present Lynch Bpad, and reported very favourably on it. I ac companied Mr. Sotham on his survey and the remarks I now submit are based on observations and enquiries made during that journey. It may presumably be taken for granted that, as a result of the War, the communication from Mesopotamia to Western Persia through Khanikin will be controlled exclusively by Russia and ourselves. In this case the “ raison d'etre ” for the Khorremabad line will disappear. On the other hand the need of lateral communication between Mesopotamia and the Persian plateau will increase. With the Khorremabad project out of court we must fall back on a line further south, and in this connection a line from Northern Arabistan through the Bakhtiari naturally recommends itself as being entirely in our sphere of political control and as tending to develop and strengthen our hold on the area which holds our valuable oil interests. It would, moreover, form an obvious link in the development of any main artery of communication between Mesopotamia and India. ITp till nowit has been generally accepted that the country through which the present Lynch road lies, offers no practical alignment for either road or railway. This was considered the opinion of Engineers, who, however, followed closely the caravan road, and seem to have taken it for granted that no alternative alignments existed. It was never clearly recognised that the track f of the present road was selected almost entirely from considerations of security, | and without regard to terrain or gradients. A glance at the map shows that ( the road lies through the heart of Bakhtiari as far away as possible from such disturbing elements as Quashgais and Kuhgelus on one side and Luristan tribes on the other. Even as it is the road is not sufficiently removed from the Kuhgelus to ensure its uninterrupted security. Por these very reasons British travellers have scarcely ever ventured to examine the country to either side.— ^n summer, owing to the insecurity prevailing and, in winter, owing to the severity of the climate and the difficulties of travelling over snow blocked passes. A study of the geography of the country shows that the present Lynch road follows as difficult an alignment as can be found, and that there is no reason why a much easier route should not be discovered.

Section showing Lynch road and new alignment.mnnmwm 4 may be much more readily understood from a consideration of the following Separating Ispahan and Ahwaz we have the Zagros mountains which we may look on as a series of four or five elevated deep troughs running north-uest and south-east. In an examination of this mountain system three factors present themselves on the existence of which the possibility of finding a practicable alignment could be deduced. The factors are (1) The Zagros range tends to fall away to the south-east; (2) The ridges are not continuous but broken by gaps; and (3) The bottoms of the trougl^rlike valleys/often open out into alluvial plains of considerable extent, presumably the beds of former lakes. To take advantage of these three factors an alignment must be looked for which, by leaving Ispahan in a southerly direction, strikes the Zagros at a point C where the range tends to fall away. Trom this point the. main system is passed by moving diagonally to the line of the valleys, trusting to find convenient breaks in the ridges to get from one trough to another and also utilizing to the full any of the plains that might be encountered. The above theory was greatly strengthened by reports which all pointed to the existence of an ancient paved way along such a line. The theory thus advanced was found justified in practice. At C the Zagros was crossed at 7,600 feet at as probably a low a point as could be found in its entire length. Convenient gaps and faults were discovered offering an easy way from one parallel way to another, and it was found possible to utilize no less than three alluvial plains, thus securing 20 to 30 miles of the easiest form of road construction. The alignment thus suggested lies on an average of about 40 miles to the south-east of the present Lynch road, with which it compares most favourably in all respects.5 1 'last t S t l\ 2r ;d at in to id ed he ad ag to he he The highest point crossed is only some 7,600 feet as compared to 9,000 feet on the Lijnch road, and the total rise and fall through the Zagros is only Vide cross sectional plan, Appendix M. 10,000 feet, Compared to 10,000 feet, the . . corresponding figure for the present carai an road. The road it is true is some 20 miles longer, but a considerable set off is the fact that near O, the point of its greatest south-east trend, it is v only JG miles to Yezd-i-Khast over an easy track, which is in fact, at present carriageable except for a small pass of about 1,100 feet. A study of a small scale map will show at a glance that the alignment thus vide Appendix k. formed would obviously provide a link . . i n any chain of communication between Mesopotamia and the xeisian plateau and also in any great overland artery between India and the Mediterranean. For this reason it would seem that even ii Fussian objections preclude the possibility of our makinG* Ispahan the terminus of a motor road or railway, the project of a road or railway from Arabistan through Malamir to Yezd-i*Kliast would be desirable on its own merits. In this connection it is hardly necessary to point out the prime importance of securing the markets to the south of Ispahan. The question of a carriage road versus a light railway has also to be Fyde note on this subject. Appendix h. considered. It is axiomatic that a railway . . . * s ’ ^om most points of view, superior to the road.. Ihe only question which remains to be decided is whether railway construction is practicable. Mr. Sotham, the Persian Transport Company’s Engineer, is not prepared to hazard a definite opinion on this point, but he thinks that the alignment we examined is such as to warrant the detailed survey of the route being undertaken by a properly qualified survey party. There is, however, another consideration to be borne in mind, the factor of | time. It is clear that it is important that we should consolidate our position a as far as practicable during the duration of the W ar, while, as regards our trade in Central Persia, it is clear that, unless we succeed in doing something to decrease transport rates from the Gulf to the hinterland, British trade will, on the conclusion of the Mar, be entirely driven out of the Ispahan markets, as well as those to the south. If, therefore, the provision under present conditions of material for railway construction is not feasible, it would seem advisable to push on with a motor road which might be laid out so as to allow of its conversion to a light railway at a future date. Having discovered a practical alignment from the Arabistan plain to the Persian plateau through the Zagros it remains to consider how such a line * should best be prolonged to Mesopotamia through Arabistan. The chief factors governing such an extension are :— tjlA- [*l*£+**-^ (1) the presence of the oil-fields and the obvious advantages of selecting an alignment which would fit in with the development of the Oil Company’s communications; (2) the utilization of the Karun, which may be of importance if the question of material is likely to prove a difficult one ; (3) the selection of an alignment which can be developed either I towards Basrah or through Shuster and Dizful to the Tigris A.* line ; (4) talamir may be taken a ruling point on any alignment for a motor road or railway; and (5) the Mangasht plateau is likely to provide a bill station for the oil fields and Arabistan and will be required to be connected up bv a road or railway. The alignment suggested is shown in red on map K. The bearing of the various factors above enumerated on this alignment will now be considered in detail:— ($., The fact that the oil market of Central Persia is a valuable one, and that oil would be the motive fuel employed whatever form of traction were adopted, make it clearly an advantage that the alignment should pass either 1S6 F. &amp; P. D.6 / V. fi ^ ^ctVrvvv- /|- (bxdn*- (/SVtr*+*i~4 ■ i i fiiom Tt is also manifestly desirable that through the oil-fields or close f ‘ s jj,j e the existing commtmi- the alignment should coincide, as fa P - _ ' th Th p resent line 0 f cation of the Oil Company from the fields to thejout anfl communications used by the Comp y ^ Thc w ) 10 i e 0 f this line will thence by cart road fm - 3 m railway and as regards the present cart road eventually be converted ^.^^‘r^ny’s Engineers are 1 convinced that ssartsrtSf sr/s»»■ '&gt;• present figures of transport. Hi) The utilization of the iTarm -Taking !t for granted that capital and material will not be readily forthcoming, it is clearly necessary to keep witlun «ie narrow limits of the practical. In the Karun we have an organised line of communication from Mohammerah to Darrel, Khazmeh with a break of 4 miles at Ahwaz. If at any time, in the future, navigation on the Karun, oivimr to irrigation schemes or other causes, becomes impracticable, no difficulty wuuld be experienced in transferring the traffic to a light railway as the nature ali mment for such a railway would be from Darreh Khazmeh along the left bank of the Karun to Mohammerah, so as to be in a position to serve the pipe U &gt; In this connection it may be mentioned that the capacity of the present nine line can be quadrupled by the erection of additional pumping stations. This and the fact that the districts to the east of the present pipe line such as Ma.natain and White Oil springs are the most likely ones in which new oil- helds £ will be opened up, would seem to point to its being more advantageous to keen a railway to the left as opposed to the right bank of the river. The chief ai-ument in favour of the right bank is founded on the proposal to make the terminus of the railway at Basrah and not at Mohammerah. Tins proposal does not however, take into consideration political difficulties. The Persian Government have certainly a strong claim that the terminus of an Arabistan railway should be at Mohammerah, and it is doubtful whether we could get a concession from them for a line terminating at Basrah. If, however, such a concession were obtained it would probably be found best to cany the line across to the left bank at Ahwaz and continue it to Shush ter md Darreh Khazineh. The reasons for this alignment will be discussed in the succeeding paragraph. (m) The selection of an alignment which can be developed either towards Basrah or through Shushter and Dizful to the Tigris Line. A 'lance at the map, Appendix K, will show that, as the alignment through the Zagros would provide an obvious link in any scheme of through communication between India and Mesopotamia, the natural prolongation of this link to the west would lie through Shushter, Dizful and Shush to the Tigris at Kut-el-Amarah. This section would conveniently take off from the Malamir-Ahwaz section iust before reaching Darreh Khazineh and would run up the foot of the hills to Shushter where a bridge over the Karun w'ould be necessary. This would not be a costly and difficult undertaking even if considered as a bridge pure and simple. If, however, the line or road w r as carried across the river by a dam the latter, as an irrigation concern alone, would be likely to pay a handsome profit on the initial outlay, and we should get our road or railway across the river for nothing. The problem of crossing the Diz at Dizful would admit of a precisely similar solution. This line, while serving all the more important points in Arabistan, w r ould at the same time provide a line of communication between Ahwaz and Dizful, only 10 miles longer than the direct desert road via Shush. (iv) The question of an alignment between Malamir and Darreh Khazineh is one which can only be decided after expert examination of the two alterna tive route®:— i. via. the fields and the Mardafil range—80 miles. The most direct route but passing over difficult country. ii. Ab Gah, Ab Lashkar and Kaleh Tull, 20 miles longer but a much easier alignment. m,(v) The Mangasht plateau provides an ideal site for a hill station. The alignment now recommended would make it accessible, both to the fields and to Arabistan. The alternative alignment to that, suggested is provided by the present Lynch road. The chief advantages in its favour are that Ahwaz is very nearly as near to Malamir as is Larreh Khazineh and that it would avoid the necessity of an additional break in bulk at Larreh Khazineh. There is no doubt that any business man would look askance at a four-mile break at Ahwaz between the upper and lower river, and an additional break at Larreh Khazineh involving considerable expenditure in connection with an extra Lepot and Staff. To these objections, the answer which would seem to be adequate is that- i. The materialization of the Ahwaz-Larreh Khazineh railway is only a question of time and, when it does come, it will be a trunk line over which the Ispahan traffic wull represent but a fraction of the gross traffic; n. In the case of motor transport the provision of cheap motive fuel is a crux of the whole question which can best be solved by a close identification of interests with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, such as would be likely to be promoted by the selection of an alignment that would be of the maximum use to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company both as regards their communications between the fields and refinery, the development of the hinterland holding their potential oil interests, and the .opening up of the Central Persian Oil market. Having now discussed the general alignment, the question of concession Vide Appendix l. and political issues involved arises. The parties interested in the developments of communications in South-West Persia are— 1. The Persian Railway Syndicate. 2. The Persian Transport Company* i'.v • 3. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The first two named groups hold various concessions for roads and railways, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is obviously interested in any measures which will tend to greatly enhance the value of their oil holdings. It is clearly of importance that these three groups should amalgamate their various interests and be prepared to act in consonance with the general aims of British policy in South-West Persia. Provided such an amalgamation could be effected, the political difficulties involved would be greatly simplified. The construction of a road or railway in Arabistan is already amply provided for by our present concessions, but'the extension of such a road or railway through Bakhtiari is likely to prove a more difficult matter. It will be remembered that the concession for the present Lynch road wns given by the Persian Government to the Khans in 1898, for a period of GO years. That concession provides for the levy of tolls on laden animals and the wording would not cover the construction of a motor road far less a railway. If we approached the Persian Government for a railway or road concession we should, in all probability, have to agree to pay 20 per cent, net profits, and this 20 per cent, would have to be so divided between the Persian Government and the Bakhtiari Khans so as to secure for the latter an interest in the new undertaking which would at least cover the present income thev derive from the tolls on the road which now amount to Tomans 40,000 a year. * From figures show r n in Appendix B it is seen that the net profit we could expect to derive would be approximately Tomans 350,000, 20 per cent, of which would amount to Tomans 70,000. I have already shown that Tomans 40,000 would have to be set aside to compensate the Bakhtiari Khans, but, in practice, something over this sum would be necessary as the Khans’ interest in the present undertaking is not limited to the collection of the tolls. The movement of some 100,000 mules a year through their country raises the prices of grain and fodder from fifty per cent, to 100 per cent, above its normal rate, and the Khans’ incomes are chiefly derived from rents in kind. It is, therefore, clearthat, in order to obtain the Khans' good-will without Xktwifbe Of the uroiect would, under present circumstances, be impossible, it win be essential to offer them something more than tile fortj ^ousan J Q ^ d t'ure weight fix^t foTans 60,000. On the other hand it will be seen from &gt;,mendix A that 20 per cent, of the net profit will only represent Tomans 70 000 which has to suffice both for the Bakhtian Khans and the 1 ers.an Government. If you assume that we can bring about an arrangement whereby the two parties agree to divide this amount between themsehes, the a 1 « share wi 1 only he Tomans 35,000, whereas it has been shown that they will have a right to expect Tomans 60,000. The difference is allowed for by including an item of Tomans 1^,000 in the estimate of capital required on this account of payment to Bakhtiari Khans for their good-will in the present caravan road. A substantial sum of money of this extent shou &lt; prove I sufficient to satisfy the Khans’ demands, especially if it were accompanied with 1 the offer of a concession of a political nature in Arahistan such as the loimal inclusion of Eamuz^in Bakhtiari limits. It has been mentioned above that the Hoad Company would have to be prepared to part with 20 per cent, of the net profits as the price of the con cessions. This statement is based on the analogy of other concessions in Persia. The 20 per cent, precedent has, however, been broken m the case oi Julta- Tabriz Eailway. By *he terms of this concession the Persian Government contents itself with half the profits over and above 7 per cent. It is well worth consideration whether some analogous arrangements in regard to the present scheme v’ould not simplify the problem of adjusting the rnal claims of the Bakhtiaris and the Persian Government. It must he remembeied that the latter stand indirectly to profit enormously by the increase in the customs duties, and it would, therefore, only be equitable that the Bakhtiaris should have the lion’s share of the direct profits accruing from the actual transport. This aspect of the question should, wTien the time comes, be forced on the attention of the Persian Government in as forcible a manner as possible. I lie tolls on laden animals which the Khans at present levy amount to approximately 52 brans a ton. It w T ould be obviously s krs. per A of a ton. unsound to use this as a permanent basis for determining the Khans’ compensation, as such a rate is a heavy burden on trade. Our policy should be to fix the Khans’ interests so that, as the traffic develops, their share, while increasing proportionately, should however decrease if expressed ir terms of a toll per ton of goods carried. This object can be best obtained by giving the Khans a percentage of net profits and abolishing the present system of tolls. The other difficulties of a political nature rise in connection with the question of security. The alignment selected passes for a considerable distance along the border of the Kuhgelu country and, until the Kuhgelu tribes are brought to heel, w T ork on the road is out * of the question. As the Bakhtiaris by themselves are quite incapable of tackling the Kuhgelus, the solution of the problem w T ould seem to lie in the appointment of a Political Officer at Behbehan, and the raising of the Bakhtiari Levy Corps, with possibly an ex tension to Kuhgelu country as soon asw r ork on the road is commenced. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to His Britannic Majesty’s Minis ter, Tehran. APPENDIX A. Report on cost and maintenance of road from Darrell Khazineh through the Oil Fields and Malamir to Ispahan and probable cost of running motor transport on same. In pre-war days the normal traffic over this road amounted to 3,000 tons up and 2,000 tons dowm, at an average rate of £25 a ton upward and £12 a ton downward. As this volume of traffic found its way over the road, in spite of the many disadvantages of mule transport, such as endless delays in transit, vary ing rates and lack of transport, all of wffiich led to loss of market and lockingup of the capital, it is clear that, with motor transport and its attendant advantages, we can safely count on equal volume of traffic. In addition to the amount of goods traffic our statistics show that, as far as pilgrims alone are concerned, at least ten thousand pilgrims a year, which is but one-ninth of the total pilgrims from Persia to the Holy places, would avail themselves of a motor transport service over the proposed route. In order to obtain as conservative an estimate as possible no allowance will be made for local traffic which might naturally be expected to accompany the improvement in transport facilities—nor is any account taken of the move ment of oil to the Central Persian markets except that it is assumed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would sell petrol at cost price to the Road Company. It is proposed to employ lorries of five tons capacity such as are employed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company between Darreh Khazineh and the Oil Fields, but, as roads in this country cannot be kept up to such a high state of perfection as at Home, the following figures are based on a useful load of 4- tons per lorry. If we take the total of upward traffic at the very conservative figure of 3,000 tons per annum it wall be seen from the attached statement that 29 lorries will be required. As the total downward cargo is.only 2,000 tons there would only be available 74 tons of cargo yearly for each lorry, whereas the downward cargo space is 132 tons. Put it must be remembered that, owing to the high upward rates, muleteers refuse to take downward cargo at* less than £7-10-0 a ton, and it is reasonable to suppose that, at the rate of £5 a ton, we could find goods to fill up remaining cargo space, i.e., 58 tons per lorry per annum.

Therefore the number of round trips each lorry can make in the year— 300 64 300 X 2 ~ °2. As each 1 orry carries 4 tons the total upward cargo that can be carried is 32x4—128 tons from which must be deducted -I- the total weight of petrol and lubricating oil, 23 tons. Therefore the net upward cargo wffiich each motor lorry can take is 128—23=105 tons.* Compare with estimate of £180,000 given by Persian Railway Syndicate, Mr. Douglas. 10 Q • 3 000 Therefore, to carry 3,000 tons of upward cargo, we shall require ~ =29 lorries.

Therefore, total number of lorries required will be — 10,000 30x32 = 11 The gross earning capacity of each lorry will threfore be 30 X 32 x 3 X 2 £ per annum ....

P.S .—The above estimates are in every way most conservative. They take no account of the following additional sources of income ;— («) Local traffic in passengers and goods. (J) Mail subsidy. (c) Tolls for private cars using the roads. (d) Transport of specie. (e) Increase in traffic following on improved transport facilities. (/) Diversion to this route of the bulk of the traffic which normally travels up the Shiraz road to the districts north of Shiraz. APPENDIX B. Comparison between a motor road and light railway. It has already been shown that the cost price of running a lorry that will transport 105 tons of upward and 128 tons of downward cargo, works out at £1,430, which is equivalent to £6 a ton. This fi ^ure does not however include road maintenance which, for the minimum figures of 6,000 tons, works out at £4 a ton. A further £7 a ton has to be added to cover interest on capital, sinking fund charges, royalty on concession, etc. Of the above three items it will be seen that the first, viz., £6, the cost price of transport, cannot be reduced, but the remaining two items which together come to £11 a ton, can obviously be reduced in direct ratio to the amount of goods carried. If, for example, the 6,000 tons which are now being carried by pack transport were quadrupled, which I think can be legitimately counted on to take place in the course of the 10 years following the opening of the road, the above £11 could be reduced to- £3. We should then have a net rate of £9 a ton, which would be susceptible of only a very slight further reduction. To develop the country to its fullest extent it would be necessary to aim at 1 a verv much lower rate of transport than £9 a ton. The bulk of the natural resources, such as grain, raisins, pistachios, timber, tobacco and cotton require a low freight in the neighbourhood of £3 a ton to allow of export. Such a low freight only a railway can provide. 1 If we assume that a 2-foot gauge railway between Darreh Khazineh and Isnahan could be constructed at £2,500 a mile and would then cost us £750,000 (The Persian Bailway Syndicate’s Engineer, Mr. Douglas, estimated at £900,00 q for a railway over the much more difficult Lynch road alignment). M e should require to make a net profit of £100,000 to cover a 10 per cent, dividend sinking fund charges and a royalty to the Bakhtiari Khans. Relying then on the generally accepted proportion existing between gross and net profits, the former should amount to £250,000 which would be provided by 80,000 tons of goods at £3 a ton.t 12 In what term of years South-West Persia would be in a position to import and exert this volume of goods 5 is difficult to say. The question would requiie careful consideration and examination. In the light of the above observations, it would seem that the best course would be to make a start with motor transport on a road, which would allow of its being converted into a light railway as the development ol the country sufficiently advanced. appendix c.

The total pilgrim approximately 90,000 made up as follows: — traffic will therefore amount to Indian Shiahs .... • . 6,000 Khanakin ..... • • . 30,000 Basrah ..... • • . 55,000 91,000 Of this total at least 10,000 can be safely counted on to make use of an organised line of communication from Ispahan to Ahwaz. It would also be safe to count on the transport of 1,500 corpses. Before the war pilgrims freely used the motor car service between Baghdad and Baqubah, a distance of 32 miles, for which they paid a fare of i a medjidieh. On this analogy they would be ready to pay Tomans 15 for the journey from Ispahan to Ahwaz. The transport rate of corpses would be approximately the same. Considering that the normal journey from Ispahan to Ahwaz to take 20 days and a pilgrim must spend at least 6 Tomans for his food and that a mule or donkey would cost him for the upward journey 20 to 12 Tomans and for the downward journey 12 to 8 Tomans, it is reasonable to suppose that they would be ready to pay Tomans 15 for a seat in a motor bus. This contention is moreover confirmed by the fact that, before the War, pilgrims freely used the motor bus service from Baghdad to Baqubah, a distance of 32 miles, for which they paid a fare of half a medjidieh. APPENDIX D. The advantages of erecting a refinery at the Oil Field or Darreh Khazineh. The following is an estimate of the amount of oil refinery would have to produce :— Petrol for 40 lorries at 43 tons each . Oil sales in Ispahan ..... Local consumption ..... products that such a Tons. . 1,720 • 1,200 , 500 Total 3,420 Without a refinery at the Oil Field?, the whole of this 3,420 tons would have to flow down the pipe line and return by river steamer. At the pipeline charges are 3s. a inn and freight by river 20s. The saving on transport that would result from the creation of a refinery at the Fields or Darreh Khazineh would amount to:— 3420 X 23 20 £3,933. We have also to take into consideration the fact that, if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company decided to supply, the Transport Company with petrol at a special rate in exchange for the right to run their oil tankers over the road, there would be a further saving on the difference between the special rate and the market rate. The cost price of petrol at Abadan used to be 6d. per gallon or £7 a ton, but it will be seen that, in order to be as conservative as possible, I have taken a figure double this amount as a special rate to be charged by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. For the sake of example let us assume that the market rate of petrol at Abadan is Is. 6d., i.e., 50 per cent.^ higher than the special rate stipulated for, then it is clear that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would prefer to sell their 1,720 tons of petrol in the open market at Is. 6d. a gallon making thereby £36,120 than dispose of it to the Road Company at Is. a gallon making £24,080. On the other hand, if a refinery were erected at the Oil Fields, it would be immaterial to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at what rate they sold their petrol provided they got a sufficient quid pro quo in regard to special freight rates for their oil over the road. It would, therefore, seem to be a matter of the greatest importance to effect an amalgamation of the interests between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Transport Company. It will also be readily understood that the figure of 3,420 tons of oil products to be prepared at the Field Refinery is a very modest estimate which takes no account of the increase of traffic, petrol for South Persian Rifles, transport, increased oil sales in South Persia and demand for petrol by private cars. APPENDIX E. Possibilities of commercial development in the districts to be served by the road. Minerals .—A deposit of canal coal has been identified in the Mangasht range, about 9 miles from the Kaleh Tul Ab Lashkar section of the°road alignment. Further coal deposits are reported in Chahar Mahal at the mouth of the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash and near Karkunah. Ozokerite.—Iio. the Mangasht range in several places and also at the foot of the Kuh-i-Lishun near the Khaneh Mirza plain. Silver .—There are some old workings at the foot of the Sultan Ibrahim, about 15 miles from Lurdegan. OH -—There are several oil shows in the vicinity of the road from the Mangasht up to Khaneh Mirza. Irrigation schemes :— Chigakhur dam .—By damming up the exit of the Chigakhur valley it will be possible to make a reservoir of 3 square miles in area and an average depth of 20 feet. This will irrigate 10,000 acres in the Ganduman Valley which could be extensively planted with fruit and timber trees and thus provide a nucleus for the building up of a small town which should tend to focus the commercial and social development of Char Mahal and Bakhtiary on itself instead of the present tendency to gravitate towards Ispahan. The Ganduman Valley lies at an average elevation of 7,200 feet. There are indications that in ancient days a considerable town existed at the eastern end of the valley through which the road passes. Local tradition has it that it marked one of the sites of the seven dwellings known as Gambida, of Shah Bahram. The colour of this gumbid was that of wheat whence the city was known as the ‘ Gumbid-i-Ganduman Bun ” now contracted into Ganduman-.Malamir—Tha plain of Matonnr was in days ipast, has become silted up.

This route may conveniently be divided into four sections (1) Ispahan to Hauz-i-Mahi, 43J miles, Plateau Section. (2) Hauz-i-Mahi to Lurdegan, 78 miles, high upland section. (3) Lurdegan to Malamir, 84J miles, Mountain Section. (4) Malamir to Darreh Khazineh, 107 miles, broken foot hills Section. Plateau Section .—Elat plains with a hard gravel surface and hills up to 1,500 feet in height running north and south rising abruptly from the plain, the continuity of which is, however, never severed as the hill ranges either tail away into the plain or have wide rifts. Prosperous villages and gardens at wide intervals wherever water can be found by underground kanats.High Uplands Section.—'From the Central Persian Plateau at 5,000 feet the ground rises by an easy step of 2,000 ft. to the Upland country of Chahar Mahal which may be considered as the outer rampart of the main Zagros range. Here again we have gravel plains between hills, but the plains are smaller and more undulating and the hills higher and more confused. We have already reached a more genial country. Cool in summer with snow in winter. Springs and brooks and green meadows, with frequent villages studded over the plains, and innumerable black tents of the nomads on the hill slopes. No great engineering difficulties have so far been met with as a way can always be found fro°m one plain to another over a low col or along an easy valley. Mountain Section .—The main Zagros range is now entered. The valleys become steep and narrow. The quiet brooks convert themselves into foaming mountain torrents which lose themselves in deep and rugged gorges. Serrated rocky crests and frowning precipices replace the gentler hill slopes of the previous section. Thfe rock strewn hill sides are covered with stunted oak, mniper and wild almonds. The road, however, picks its way through all these difficulties with surprising dase. One really difficult gorge, 6 miles in length, has to be negotiated but, on the other side, the comparatively broad Karim valley is entered, whose terraced banks afford an easy line through the heart of the Zagros. Low Bill Section.— kite* crossing the Mangasht range, the last. outlier of the Zagros, we enter a tract of low gypsum hills. The trees have disappeared and the streams, when encountered, are salt. The terrain is most broken and confused and would, in places, offer difficulties .to the road engineer, which would be still further complicated by the lack of stone sufficiently hard for metalling. As the oil fields are passed the hills subside and finally merge into the alluvial plain of Arabistan a few miles from Darreh Khazineh. APPENDIX H. Loute report of the Ispahan-Ahioaz route through Lurdegan and Bars. The Shiraz road is followed for 14J miles to the far side of the Urchin Pass when a track branches off to the right Ispahan 5,000 feet to Deb Surkh, isj xmies. over a clayey plain to Deh Surkh. A (mod natural track the whole way. The Zindeh End, with its gardens and extensive irrigation, lies 3 miles to Deh surkh to Naichan, 15 miles. ^he right. At 13 miles the road bends round the end of ridge known as Puzeh of Kulinjan. Over a broad gravel plain, intersected by frequent kanats, the villages of Kaleh Safid, Loo and Abrau are passed at Nakhan to Haui-i-Mahi, is nnies. 6, 10 and 12 miles respectively. Por the last 6 miles the road becomes stoney on approaching the foot slopes of the Bidikum range. The track passes over stony ground to the foot of the hills which it follows to the mouth of Tang-i- Duzdan, 4 miles Hauz-i-Mahi 6,000 feet to Urujan, 17* miles. (6,500 feet). The carriage road lies in the plains and only turns into the hills when opposite the mouth of the Tang. Prom the latte/point there is a steady rise of 1 in 50 increasing to 1 in 30 up a shallow winding valley to the crest 7,800 feet, 10 miles. Thence by gradual descent over an open undulating plain to Urujan, 7,200 feet. The road leads over the level plain (2 to 4 feet of snow in winter) rising 200 feet in the first five miles and a further Urujan to Ganduman, n miles. to the top of the Gardan*i-Halwai at rjx miles, 7,600 feet. Thence by an easy slope of two miles to the level of the Ganduman plain, 7,000 feet. Over the level to Ganduman village situated at the foot of Kuh-i-Madar-i-Dukhtar. Ganduman is said to be one of the sites of the seven Gumbids of Shah Bahram. The colour of this Gumbid was that of wheat whence the city was known as the “ Gumbid-i-Ganduman Bun ” now contracted into Ganduman. The Halwai Pass already mentioned is so called owing to the presence in16 ancient days of a “Halwai ” shop at this summit. In further support of the tradition that Ganduman marks the site of an ancient city we may quote the existence of a mound with ancient pottery remains and the fact that tne plain to the north is known as Char Bazaar. Snow in winter varies from 1 foot to 3 feet. On January 20th, 1917, there was 14'. Over the open plain for IJ miles followed by a climb of 150 feet to cross a spur thence round another spur to the plain Ganduman to Khonargi Bala, 5 * miles. level at 3 J miles where the road crosses the Ab-i-Ganduman (the discharge of the Chigakhur lake) by a four arched bridge. At 4 A miles Konarga Plain is reached and further on Konargi Bala (both Armenian villages). Sirdar Fateh’s house is about one mile on the far side of the village. This is a very difficult stage in winter owing to the snow on the Gushingli Pass. It is sometimes impossible. On Khonargi Baia to Dorakhun, i5i miles. leaving the village make for the spur on the left side of the valley, thence up the right bank of the stream to Bichird ( 7,200 feet) a village of fifty houses belonging to the Babadi-i-Akasheh. From Bichird there is a direct road to Ganduman through the low hills to the north which is said to be 2 miles shorter. There is also a carriageable road from here to Imam Khes, the last Bakhtiari village on the Qasbgai border. Cross the stream to the left bank and ascend the side of the valley. There is a gentle rise of 200 feet for 2 J miles and thence a descent of 300 feet to the Ab-i- Bichird which is forded at the Godar-i-Kabk, said to be one of the finest Chikor shooting grounds in Chahar Mahal and one at which the Bakhtiari Khans make very big bags every year. After crossing the stream the road bends righthanded round the slopes of Dudelu. We now skirt the Qashgai border the Kuh-i-Tagaraon the far side of the stream being a Qashgai Camping ground. This road is therefore said to be very unsafe in summer. From the stream there is a sharp rise of 150 feet in the first quarter of a mile, and after that the tract which is excellent leads up at a general slope of ] /40 to the crest of the ridge at 10 miles whence there is a sharp descent of 200 feet into a hollow at the bottom of which there is a ruined caravanserai. On the far side of the hollow there is a col which is the highest point of the Gushingli Pass (7,550 feet) 11 miles. Tradition has it that Shah Shangal and his army perished on this pass whence it became known as Gur-i-Shah Shangal or grave of Shah Shangal, now contracted 'into Gushingli. From the top of the pass the tract leads down a valley dropping 500 feet in the first two miles, thence the valley opens out and the slopes become easier till the village of Dorakhun is reached at 4 ^ miles from the top of the pass. The valley contracts but opens out again at 1J miles. Keeping to the ^ .. left through low hummocky hills the Dorakhun to Smi, 14 miles. i -r» • i i , village of Girdeh Bisheh is passed at 3 miles on the right (6,100 feet). A mile further on the stream enters a deep canyon to join the Ab-i-Ganjan river. Half a mile before the junction the road bears aw r ay to the left, negotiates a succession of deep nallhahs and drops to the Ab-i-Ganjan at 5J miles, height 5,875 feet. There is a rough hurdle bridge, which loaded mules find some difficulty in negotiating, and in a slippery shelf of rock to cross on the far side. A quarter mile up stream there are the remains of a fine masonry bridge. The ridge on the far side of the river is known as the Kareh pass which is reached at 65 -miles (6,400’feet). The^e is a tower here which is said to be strongly held in summer, as this portion of the road is peculiarly liable to attack by Qashgai tribesmen. From the top of the pass there is an easy descent along the side of the hill till the bed of a watercourse is met at 6,250 feet. When the Afghan invaders penetrated as far as this point they found themselves held up by a stone across the valley. The remains are still visible. The Afghans retired, but eventually succeeded in turning the position and occupying Khaneh Mirzafrom the direction of Falad.f 17 xe le in , re a in es id la ar ;Ji )n &gt;n rd m le id ?r. a ■i- st ri of de to a of of ii. be id al ae ce m be lie at a lie ps lie ry be is be to ill ;rs )SS he The track continues up the valley for f of a mile when it crosses a crest line at 6,550 feet. It then descends slightly on to a small plain from the ed^e of which there is a further drop of 400 feet on to the Khaneh Mirza plain, which traverses for a distance of five miles to its southern extremity where the village of Sini is situated. One mile over the level plain to the Tang-i-Khaneh Sard, known as such Sini 6,100 feet to Lurdegan 5,200 feet, 14* miles. bec . ause a cold wind is usually experienced a t its mouth, the track lies on the right side of the valley which opens out but closes in again at 5 miles at which point an oak forest is entered. The village of Deh IS T au is passed on the left. From the end of the gorge, which is here known as the Tang-i-Kaluran (10J miles), the road crosses the stream (Ab*i-Lurdegan) by a ford and then emerges on to the Lurdegan plain which is covered with thick oak scrub. The village of Lurdegan lies in the centre of the plain. Extensive rice cultivation, water from copious springs which form a small lake to the west of the village/ Cross the stream and follow down the right side of the valley, which is Lurdegan to Bidela «ta Muuj, 17 miles. about a mile aCl’OSS Well . WOoded slopes terraced at intervals for rice cultivation. At 7 miles a road takes off to the right which leads through well wooded and undulating: country to Bidela. Follow the road to the left dowm the valley to the 9th mile. The mountains now close in, the Burra Boz on the left and the Kuh-i-Munj on the right. The path is in one or two places difficult till Munj is reached at 4 miles. The valley now opens out for another three miles and is extensively sown with rice. For the remaining 3 miles into Bidela the river flows through a ravine which is just wide enough to take the road. Trees in places seriously impede progress of laden animals. There is a cave with rock carvings and inscriptions on the right bank about 2| miles from Bidela. The gorge route which the road will follow is in its present state only Bidei. to Kitatc, io miUs. practicable for an active man on foot. there are two caravan routes over the Kuh Bahmistan involving a climb of 4,500 feet, but these routes are only passable from March till December. In winter the best route to take is from Munj via Gargar and Kuhi Gil to Bars. The g^orge already referred to is named after the villege of Bidela at its mouth. The sides rise precipitously for 1,000 feet or more, but there is a mass of loose debris at the bottom, which would supply the necessary foundation for a road. At 2| miles the stream joins the Karun which here flows between steep hill sides which, in the course of the next mile, become vertical and form a further gorge from which the river breaks out into the Kuh-i-Gill District. From this point on to Kittah the Karun flows between clay hills with steep slopes. There is no difficulty in making one’s way on foot along the edge of the river, provided one is prepared to climb up the hill sides to circumvent some steep bluffs. The road alignment would keep to the Karun as far as the junction with the Khirsam. There is a suitable site for 5 m ni tUk t0 Dch Mullah vi&lt;i the r ° ad alignmeuts * a bridge about 400 yards upstream. On crossing the river the road will have to climb 700 feet to reach the terraced land between the Mangasht and the Karun which offers an easy alignment. The only ford over the Khirsan is opposite Bars, so unless kellecks can be arranged from the village of Sar-i-chal or lower down the caravan wull have to go round via Bars. The track, which has a good surface except at one or two points, keeps Deh Muiiah to Shaiwan, s miles. near the foot of the Mangasht at about 200 feet above the Karun. At five miles it descends to the village of Mir Ahmed. From this point onwards the Karun approaches the mountains with the result that the track has to cling to the precipituous slopes of the hills and is bad in places. Tw o ravines the Tang-i- Khush Chilow at miles and the Tang*i-Ru-Kallu at five and half miles are the two chief obstacles met on this stage. The former entails a descent of 300 feet and the latter a steep rise of the same amount. The last mile into ghaiwand is over well cultivated river terraces. 186 F. 4 P. D.18 The track lies along the river terraces at an average height of about 250 me iraLK lies a u 0 feet ahove the Karun. At 2 miles there Shaiwand to Kaleh Madreise by road alignment, a ciangerOUS place where there lias been miiefl. a i an dslide. To avoid this point caravans often take a high level, bad on the slopes of the Mangasht through Shaikhau An£a and the Tang-i-Qaf to Kaleh Madresseh. At a miles on passing the Tan'-i-Darreh-Dowah, the mountain recedes from the river and gives place to teUVooded easy slopes. At five miles a large ravine known as the Tang-i- Kbalil Khan, leading up to the village of Shaikhan, is passed and at 8 miles another large ravine^known as the Tang-i-Qaf Continuing along the Karun valley the road gradually rises up the slopes of the Kuh-i-Qaf. . A .&gt;i i ts and some 400 feet below, the Godar Bridge is passed. Continuing a ong the slopes for another 2£ miles the Lynch road is joined at the summit of a b atch col 300 feet. Thence on to Kaleh Madresseh by the Lynch road. The Lvnch road is followed for five miles to the point where it climbs the Gurdan-i-Sarrak, whence the valley Kaleb Madresseh to Malamir by the road jg followed past the village of Dell Leh alignment, 17 miles. g miles (3^00 feet) to a point 9J miles (3 900 feet), whence the road would have to climb up the Sarrak ridge which is ’ crossed at 4,600 feet. 10J miles thence a descent of 450 feet on to a small plateau about a mile in width. From the further edge a descent on the Malamir plain 13 miles. Thence over the plain to the caravanserai at 17 miles. It has already been mentioned that the Bidemah gorge, through which it is proposed to take the road is, in its present state, only passable for an adive man on foot. Caravans will, therefore, have to travel by the Talkhab Pass which branches off from the road alignment at Munj. The track, which is at first rough and stony, ascends to the Tang-i-Shikaf-i- Tawa for half an hour and then leads Munj to Gargah, 9 miles. ^ ^ g p ur t() ^ QU to easy earthslopes which are followed to the top of the Pass known as Talkhab (1£ hours 6,400’). The descent on the far side is by a valley which is very steep at first (1,200 in the first half mile). One hour from the top of the pass the village of Ahmed-i-Khwaja is passed on the left, and 8J miles the valley joins that of the Khirsan. The village of Sa-i«Kaka is situated at the junction (280') (oil show). Turn down the Khirsan and after crossing a deep ravine the village of Gargar is reached (3,600'). The remains of the masonry bridge are below the village. The lower river track is not practicable for laden mules which on leaving the village must climb up the slopes on Gargar to Sar-i-Chul, 26 miles. ^ ^ 7()() , ^ ^ tQ the Khirsan (1J hours). The track then ascends the Tang-i-Talawah at first steeply for 700 feet (25 minutes) and then gradually along the ridge. At 35 minutes from the river the village of Takawah 12 houses is passed on the left and five minutes after the path drops down into the ravine on the right whence a track leads up on the opposite side to the village of Zaiti. After following up the ravine for 40 minutes climb up the left side to the plateau known as Durah (5,600') one hour twenty-five minutes from the river. From this point in expanse of undulating park like country is entered. At 1 hour 20 minutes pass Bard-i-Tashtan, and a heap of stones said to mark the site known as Kaleh Maddresseh. At 2 hours 15 minutes cross the Sar-i-Taq road at right angles. A little way on there is a deserted village on the right with water from the well height 6,200', which is highest point reached ou plateau. At 3 hours after passing a broad open depression the track passed down a small ravine leading into a shallow valley known as the Chali Daraz. Many sites of deserted villages on the right with water from wells. Leave the valley, climb some low hills on the right and at 4 hours reach the lip of the plateau 5,800'. Fine view to the north. The track now starts descending keeping generally along an earth ridge known as the Kuh-i-Gil. At five and half hours it leads abruptly down the east slope of the ridge to Mili Shah 4,000 6 hours and on to Sar-i-Gul 6J hours 3,800'. Total time 7 hours riding.

APPENDIX I. Ahwaz, March 10th, 1917. Gentlemen, I submit herewith the report, preliminary estimates and plans for a road between Tehran and Ahwaz for your consideration. Accompanying this report are the following drawings and plans:— 2 Sectional plans showing the levels along the road alignment. 3 Ordnance plans (which are very incorrect). 2 Prismatic compass survey maps. To « Yours faithfully, E. NOEL, Captain, H. B. M's Vice-Consul, Alncaz. Messrs. The Persian Transport Co., Ld., London. Reference to estimate sheets. Width of road.—Y have estimated for a total road width of 24 feet and of this 18 feet would be metalled or macadamised. These dimensions would only be adhered to in open country. Through difficult ravines with much rock the width would be reduced to 15 feet metalled all over. With the exception of a short stretch (about 10 miles) near Ispahan the whole of the road would be metalled and steam rolled. Gradients. —A gradient of 1 in 20 would not be exceeded anywhere. Lime and water can be found close at hand throughout the alignment. The numbers referred to in the estimate columns are explained in the first sheet of my-estimate and they include labour. The number of yards referred to in my estimate quantity sheets are not intended in all instances to correspond to the actual mileage. Masonry arches. —As regards masonry arches for bridges and culverts it will be observed that the total distance to be spanned is 1,514 feet, this does not include the bridge over the Khirsin river. c Dejauville railway. —A light railway with a gauge of about 2 feet would be necessary for transporting stone on the Ahwaz plain. £10,000 bribe to Bakhtiaris. —This was the sum mentioned by Captain Noel to Mr. Wilson and myself. Captain Noel explained that, in order to y Xc facilitate negotiations, a strong man such as the Sardar Zaffa f or Sardar Jang would be given the Ilkhaniship by the British Government. According to Captain Noel these are the only two Khans who could hold a sufficiently dominating influence over the other Khans. Survey. accurate survey of the exact alignment of the road would in my opinion considerably reduce my quantity figures. Khirsin Bridge. —The site chosen by me for the purposes of this estimate could best be bridged as follows: rock is found on the south bank for the foundations of the ficst pier, then follows approximately 70 feet of very deeptv f 20 water and then an island of rook, this island would be used to build the second Ter upon Then follows about 70 feet of deep water again, then another island S roXthis would be utilised to build the third pier upon I — method of spanning this distance would be by two iron g I s - | 'mend two spans instead of one as this would greatly facilitate transport and'the erection of the bridge. I do not recommend attempting to build masonry arches of this size, as experience has shown me that Persian masons are not up to the task. To me, it does not appear economical tp send out English masons, for the expense of doing so coupled with the cost of cement, transport and the cost of timber for centering, all ol which would have to come from Ispahan (the available timber being much too stunted), would exceed that of any alternative scheme. I have allowed £3,01)0 for these girders hut it should be noted that, at the present time, I am not at all conversant With the cost of material in England. The remaining 70 feet of the river could easi y he spanned with masonry arches, the water is shallow &gt;u rapid. t s iou!d also be noted that the site would have to be carefully surveyed before placing any orders for material, for I was only very roughly able to survey the site with the aid of a prismatic compass. Comparison of Between Malnmir and Ispahan the rises and falls of the Lynch Road total approximately 35,000 feet, whereas on the proposed alignment of the new road they approximately only total 10,000 feet. M? Douglas, of Messrs. Jackson’s, eshmated, in 1914, a sum of £80,000 for a cart road from Malnmir to Ispahan, a totally erroneously figure. If Mr Douglas intended to construct the road with a maximum gradient of 1 in 20*the rises and falls amounting to 35,000 feet would mean about 130 miles of rock cutting for nearly all the passes and hills are rock. pctimnt.fi that the road could be built within 24 months. Central description of the road alignment to be read in conjunction with the maps. Section 7—Ispahan to Urujan 61^ miles by constructed road and 63J miles by present mule track. Ibis is a straightforward section and almost a natural carriage road in spite of the fact that the highest altitude on the whole road is encountered, namely the summit of the 1 ang-i-Duzdan, which is T.SOOh Carriages indeed do now use the road, though it is not practical for automobiles. From Ispahan to Deh Surkh there is a good natural road. At a distance from Ispahan of 14 miles there is a small pass of 400 feet which offers no difficulty, and from here to Deh Surk is l j miles over a clayey plain. For 15 miles the road then passes over a good natural track, at which distance it passes round the neck of a hill and turns south. At a further distance of 2 miles the village of Nehcheh (the largest of successive villages which are to be found all the way along), is reached. From here the road passes over a gravel plain through the village of Lu and Ka!a Sefid when the ground becomes stoney on approaching the JRuk range of mountains. At a distance of 13 miles from Nehcheh the first Eakhtiari village is reached, Hauz Main, situated on the north side of the range of mountains. After leaving Hauz Mahi the road will skirt along the foot of the mountains for 4 miles, it will then turn into the mountains and run up an open wide ravine leading up to the pass known as the Tang-i-Duzdan. The total rise to the summit from the point -where the road turned into the mountains is 1,700 feet and the distance 6|- miles, including a short sweep of | mile to negotiate a short but abrupt rise near the summit. From the summit to the village of Urujan, which is the residence of Sahab-es-Sultaneh, is 6 miles and tbe descent 600 feet (a gentle descent) all the way. This is the commence ment of the cold section which extends all the way to Sini. On the north side of the mountains the weather was quite agreeable in spite of it being mid-winter, but on the south side the cold was intense, the ground being covered w ith deep hard frozen snow and the temperature falling well below zero Fahrenheit. From here we found it much too cold to move out before 10 o’clock in the morning and then only after we had covered up all exposed skin to prevent frost bite. In the event of ipotor transport, motor snow plough would be indispensible throughout this cold section. 1 f J 1 I i c c a a a s c a a a t d n o: C u I o: d m oi dc a ur po CO po W( D la] 20 at in fir of. Section 2.—-Urujan to Sini, 50 miles by constructed road and 44 miles hr existing mule track. J Fo ' “ iIes after leaying Urujan the road passes oyer easy ground and » t , e . n ei ! ters a low range of hills known as the Gardeneh Hulwai, the summit of which is passed at 7 miles from Uruja*. This spot is said to be the coldest place in Chahar Mahal, snow lying 20 days longer than anywhere else. The road then descends to Ganduman, distant 3 miles. 4rom Ganduman the road bends round to the south-west and then nasses over the neck of a low range of hills jutting out into the valley. It will then skjrt aldng the foot of the mountains and, at a distance 0 / 6 miles from Ganduman, the village ^ of Konark is passed, the residence of Sardar Fateh. In order to avoid bridging the small river of Chighakhur a short cutting rough a rocky neck of hills would be necessary at this point. The road wifi continue on for miles in a south-easterly direction, skirting the foot of the ills all the way and keeping on the north side of the river. At this point the village of Beshgird is passed. The road will then rise up 200 feet through some 1°. lying undulating lulls and then descend to the river of Beshgird where a small bridge will be necessary, the distance being 4} miles from Beshgird. .It should be noted that there is a slightly shorter cut from Ganduman to this pomt, used by the Khans on shooting expeditions, and it might be found preferable to construct the road this way. From the river the road Vises slowly up over an undulating plateau surrounded on all sides by high mountains which ?2* S&lt;3 u 1G ? uow accumulate and drift badly. We experienced a great deal of aithculty in getting over this ground owing to the very deep snow. At a distance of 2| miles from the river the road bends round to the west m . lles * lie ili g liest P oint °f the Gushingli pass is reached] altitude /,500. From this point the undulating plateau commences to descend and at nrst the undulations are rather accentuated, two rather long zig-za' sweeps being necessary, the ground also becomes much rougher. At a distance ° I j the summit tlie plateau changes to a narrow valley or ravine an ^ 10 the village of Deh Ali. The descent to Feh Ali is 700 feet and the distance direct 2^ miles. In order to maintain a 1 in 20 gradient a out 1 mile of zig-zag sweeps will be necessary; there is plenty of room for is. From the village of Deh Ali the valley opens out considerably and the descent becomes less steep. At a distance of 2 miles the village of Doruhun is reached the descent being 200', and the altitude 6,600. At a^ further distance or 3 miles the village of Girdebesheh is reached, the descent being 400 feet. on in urng on for miles the valley then becomes very rough being choked up vi n con used foot hills. This is the point on the ordnance maps marked inversion IN 0 1. F rom here there are three routes for negotiating the remainder of the descent down to the river known as the Ab-i-Ganjan. Koute A, runs own o an old ruined bridge and for a road is quite impracticable, for a maximum gradient or even a gradient feasible for horse-drawn vehicles could not be accomplished. Route B this is the route which I am inclined to favour. It will more or ess 0 ow le present mufe track through irregular and confused foot hills own 0 e end of the Gishingli valley, which at this point emerges out into nf 01 ^ 6m cr ^k-GGanjan. The river is deep and swdft, quite . °, r . e ’ a . t ra ibc passes over a rickety old timber bridge. From the , lyersion Iso. 1, the road winds through the confused foot hills • * nua y au d falling until it emerges out on to the river bank as a Lr! n n f J °i U • 1 j yards up stream from the present bridge. Here the river T&gt;i' U ] C * e xr a b0 feet masonry arch. The distance from the point, IotZo 1 * 81011 0 * • ^ tbe mule track is miles, but in order to negotiate several 9n &amp; T r f °. ss ra ^ra es and at the same time maintaining a maximum grade of 1 in of fi e i G -T 1 ^ ^ lere be miles of constructed road. The water level • , ?. )n e . 18 feet. After crossing the river the road at once rises up fi ? 1 -n m0l ? n ai1 ! 8 known as the Khara Bast. It is a rise of 425 feet over the l .. or ] 0 a ri '” e .’ anc f can easily be accomplished in two long sweeps o 2 IIllles m alL Thls brings the road to the point marked Junction No. 1. 186 E. &amp; P. D. 122 Route C, this is also quite practical route and a considerably shorter one. I estimate that it would be about 2,000 tomans cheaper than Route B. From the point marked Diversion No. 1 the road would be taken down a very narrow, steep and short gorge to the river, it would then follow the river down stream for about 600 yards which would bring it to a point opposite a ravine on the r other side of the river, this ravine rises up through the hills and joins Route B on the Khara Bast at the point marked junction Diversion No. 1. The river could be spanned bv a 60 feet masonry arch. Captain Noel and I examined this alignment as well as we were able to by climbing round the sides of the mountains. Both routes B and C are good ones. Continuing on from this point there are two routes through the .Khara Best and on to Sini. Captain Noel traversed the one to the north and I took the southern and more direct one. The road to the north pro^ ed to be an impractical one. The southern road continues on for f mile when the summit is reached, the rise being 350 feet and the altitude 6,550. The rise up through the ravine is in places very rough and steep, and there are also some awkward cross ravines to be passed. In order to maintain the gradient I have estimated that an extra miles of sweeps would be necessary. The road then descends a little on to a small plain through bleak barren hills which were deep with snow, it then again ascends a little and finally descends 400 feet on to the Sini plain. ' The distance from the summit to the plain is 2 miles and the ground is generously sprinkled all the way with large stone boulders. The road will then cross the plain to or near to the village of Sini, which is the residence of the elder sister of the Sardar Mutashem, the distance being 4 miles and the altitude of the village 6,ICO feet. The soil across the plain is partly alluvial covered with grass, partly clay and no stone. The furthest distance stone would have to be carted for construction purposes would not exceed 1 mile. It should be noted that from Sini a road could easily be constructed to Falat and from Falat on to Yazd-i-Rasht on the Shiraz-Ispahan road. There is only one range of mountains of any importance between Sini and the Shiraz road, and they are encountered a few miles south of Falat. The pass is known as the Gardeneh- i-Chahar Ruk. The alignment of this road would run down the Sini plain to the village of Khaneh Mirza where the remains of ancient Afghan fortifications are to be found. From Khaneh Mirza the road would gradually rise up through the hills over a small pass known as the Gardeneh Durman, the altitude of which is 7,300 feet. It would then descend to the village of Falat. Falat is the residence of Hadji Kawam, a minor Bakhtiari Khan on Sardar MutashanTs tide who, for political purposes, has married into the Kuhgelu tribe. The distance from Sini to Falat is about 25 miles and the altitude of the village 5,650. The distance from Falat to the summit of the C hahar Ruk pass is about 5 miles and the altitude of the pass 6,400. The distance from Falat to Yazd-i-Kasht is about 56 miles. From a point just below the summit of the pass a view r stretching right across the plain for 50 miles or so can he obtained. It would be quite simple matter to connect the main road through the Bakhtiari country with Yazd-i-Kasht and thus linking up with Shiraz. Should it be found possible to compete with the muleteers on the Shiraz road presumably this connecting road would be built, and then if the Bakhtiari road w r ere connected with the projected British Government road from Amarah to Shushtar, the whole undertaking w r ould become of international importance. Section No. 3.—Sini to Diversion No. 2, Munj, 21J miles. The road will continue for a mile over the Sini plain in a westerly direc tion when it w ill nass through a small ravine in the mountains through w r hick the river knowm as the Ab-i-Lurdegan fiow r s. On emerging from this short ravine the country opens out into a narrow valley and the zone of oak forest is reached. At a further distance of 3J miles the road enters a small gorge and the country becomes much rougher. The road w r ill continue on dow r n this ravine for 10 miles when the village of Lurdegan is reached. The road will k eep on the right hand bank of the river all the w r ay. The first portion of the ravine is known as the Tang-i-Keneh, Sini and the latter half as the Tang-i- Kuluran. The altitude of Lurdegan is 5.150 feet, and from here snow and frost are left behind. From Lurdegan the road will run dowm to a large valleyseveral miles wide keeping on the right hand side of the river all the way. The country is well wooded with oak, almonds and fig. At a distance of 7 miles from Lurdegan the road will bend across the valley to the river (which is about a mile distant) and at a distance 82 miles will enter the ravine route. Continuing on down this ravine, which in places assumes the aspect of a small gorge,, the village of Munj and the point marked Diversion No. 2 is reached. The distance is miles from the entrance to the ravine and the altitude of Munj 4,750, water level being about 50 feet lower. The road would keep on the right bank of the river but opposite Munj would cross over on to the left hank and in a few yards re-cross again to the right bank. The torrent can be bridged almost anywhere with a 25 feet masonry arch. Section No. 4.—Munj to junction of Karun river with the river Khirsin, ISJ miles. The road will continue on down the ravine keeping on the right bank of the river until at a distance of 5| miles the village of Bedela is reached. At a distance of 2-| miles from Munj the road would have to cross the river in order to avoid much rock cutting through a spur of the hills jutting out into the river, but in 20 or 30 yards would re-cross again to the same hank. Near here there is an ancient subterannean passage where Assyrian writings and carvings are to be found. On leaving Bedela the road enters a magnificent gorge with steep, sloping sides, thickly wooded, rising up from both sides of the torrent to a height of 1,500 feet. There is absolutely no difficulty to be encountered in constructing a road through this gorge. The work would certainly be severe and expensive] but the distance is short. At a distance of miles from the entrance of the gorge the Ludegan river empties itself into another magnificent gorge carrying the Karun river. At a further distance of 7£ miles from this point the large and important river known as the Ab-i-Khirsin flows into the Karun. The total distance of the gorge from Bedela is 9| miles, the water level at Bedela is 3,^50 feet and at the junction with the Ab-i-Khirsin 2,6;'0 feet. The last 2J miles of the distance is more in the nature of a large ravine or narrow valley. At a distance of f mile from the junction of the rivers the village of Kitteh is passed and about 3^ miles up the Khirsin river the large and important village of Bars is situated. This village is used by the Bakhtiari Khans as a base for their operations against the Kuhgelus. The road through the gorge would be constructed a few feet above the high water level except near Kitteh where it would be necessary to take it up about 150 feet in order to avoid . the steep sloping banks of clay and mud. The same thing would occur again at the junction of the Khirsin and Karun. There would also be about 4,000 yards of a masonry retaining wall, for in places the angle of the slopes is severe and the road would need some extra support. We made the village of Bedela our base and explored the gorge on foot for it is impossible for any sort of animal to get down to Bars by this route. We then returned to Munj or the point marked Diversion No. 2 and followed the mule track through very difficult country round to Bars. It took us four days to reach Bars from Bedela. This route would be an alternative one for the road, but it has very little in its favour and compares very unfavourably with the gorge route both as regards expanse and mileage. I will briefly describe it. Upon leaving Munj the track climbs up from an altitude of 4,750' to 6,200', which is the altitude of the summit of the pass known as the Talkhab. This mountain is connected with the large and prominent range known as the Bahmistan. It then descends 2,450 feet in 5 miles to the village of Sari Kala on the Kuhgelu border. From Sari Kala it is 16 miles to Sari Chule over very difficult country passing through the confused foot hills of the Bahmistan. The rises and falls are continuous and vary from 500 feet to 1,850 feet, but, on reaching the latter altitude, a more or less level alignment is kept for 10 miles when the track descends to the village of Sari Chule. Sari Chule is the nearest village to the ford over the Khirsin river, the ford is a bad one, it took us 7 hours to get our caravan across. The ford is accomplished by means of skin rafts and the animals are led by a man swimming on a skin.24 Section Ko. o—From junction of Khirsin and Karum rivers Tang-i-Haf. By constructed road 21| miles, by direct road 16J miles. The road now has to cross the Khirsin river and the first favourable site for a bridge is about 400 yards up stream. There are many good sites above this, one of the best being opposite the village of Sari Chule and for the pur poses of this estimate I have assumed that we shall have to go | mile up stream. After crossing over, the road will have to rise up 700 feet on to the top of the slopes and this will bring us into level and suitable country for continuing the road. An alignment for the zig-zag sweeps would be taken as much as possible in the direction of the continuation of the road, and the distance necessary to maintain the gradient would be 3 miles. This would bring the road well beyond the junction of the two rivers. Continuing for 2J miles through easy country well wooded with many small villages the village of Deh Mullah in the Kizivak district is reached. The altitude of this village is 3,500'. The road will continue for SJ miles through similar country until the Tang or ravine known as the Tang-i-Khush-i-Chelow is reached. In order to pass this ravine it would descend round the eastern shoulder to the terraces of cultivated land on the top of the river bank, then rise slowly up to the village of Mir Ahmet. On leaving this village another large ravine is passed called the Tang-i-Ku Kalu. The level of the village would be kept as closely as possible by winding round the shoulder of the ravine and crossing it as low down as possible, thus bringing the road round on to the steep precipitous cliffs near the present mule track on the other side of the ravine. The distance to this point would be 2 J miles from the Tang-i-Kushk. From this point overlook ing the Karun from a height of about 600 feet above the water our guide misled us. We travelled for the remainder of the day over impossible country, winding through a maze of ravine, defiles and irregular and confused hills or foot hills of theMungasht, rising upto heights of 2,000 feet. We returned next day and examined a lower alignment running along 30 feet above the Karun. We found remains of an ancient highway along this alignment, but it was impossible to get our caravan over it. This would obviously be the line the road would take, indeed it is the only possible route. On leaving the point near the Tang-i-Ku Nalu the road would descend to the river terrace plateau which is about 100 feet above the river. After crossing this plateau it would run along the steep slopes of the mountain at a height of about 20 feet above the river and at a distance of three miles the ravine known as the Tang-i- Darreh Dowa is crossed. Then for 2 miles the road would continue on over comparatively easy country passing at this distance another large ravine called the Tang-i-Khalil Khan. From here the road would continue on for 3 miles gradually rising up 550 feet which will bring it to a large and imposing ravine called the Tang-i-Haf. The altitude at this point being 3,100. As. there was no means of crossing the Karun or of following on this alignment in company with our caravan, we were obliged to temporarily abandon our survey. I returned a few days later via the Lynch road from Kaleh M adressa and completed my work. I followed up the Tang-i-Haf through the rocky foot hills of the Mangasht over terribly rough country and caught up my caravan struggling over the summit of the tang. The summit of this tang is about the same altitude as the Sarak pass on the Lynch road, and is the only mountain range between this point and Malamir. From the summit a clear view can be obtained right along the top of the mountains to the Gardeneh Sarak. I continu ed on down the other side of this pass through a village called Chahar Deh via a ravine which emerges out on to the Lynch road at kaleh Madressa. Section Ao. 6. —Tang-i-Haf to Malamir, by constructed road 3?J miles, by direct road 281 miles. From the mouth of the Tang-i-Haf the road will continue along the slopes of the mountains at an altitude of 3,100 and about 600 feet above the river. At a distance of 3J miles and some 400 feet below the road Godar bridge is passed. From here the road will continue along the slopes of the same mountain and at a distance of 2J miles will join the Lynch road on the summit of the gatch hill pass between the bridge and Kaleh Madressa. The altitude at this point is 3,500, the road will therefore have gradually climbed up 400 feet. The great feature of this alignment is that from the junction of the rivers Khirsin and Karun an almost straight and comparatively level road is maintained, I haveallowed | mile for negotiating several cross ravines at a point opposite Godar bridge. From here the road will continue on for 2£ miles when in order to cross the flood stream at Kaleh Madressa it will have to descend 850 feet. This stream runs down the valley from the summit of the Tang-i-Haf and crosses the Lynch road at Kaleh Madressa, then passes down a steep short gorge itself into the Karun, There is no ’way for passing this valley or ravine^ except by descending and crossing the bed of it, the altitude of which is 2,65u. In order to accomplish this descent an extra mile of road must be allowed for zig _ zags, there is plenty of room for this. From here the road would ascend the valley following the line of the Lynch road, but at a distance of 5 miles would not turn off with the Lynch road and ascend the Gardeneh Sarak, but would keep on straight up the vallay. At a distance of 1 mile from the point where the Lynch road turns off the village of Deh Leh is passed and the total distance from Kaleh Madressa is 6 miles. I have allowed an extra % mile to pass an awkward place near Kaleh Madressa. The altitude of Deh Leh is S,e00 or a 950 feet rise in 6J miles. The road would continue on up this valley for another 3J miles over easy country, and this would bring the altitude up 350 feet. From this point the road would have to ascend directly up on to the summit of the Sarak hills, a further climb of 650 feet. By following up this valley gradually rising all the way, the steep rocky lowe/slopes such as the Lynch road ascends through are avoided. The final rise of 650 feet can be accomplish ed in two long sweeps of 2J miles in all over easy slopes and fairly good ground. From the summit the road descends at onc 3 450 feet on to the plateau. This could best be accomplished by running back again along a small defile under the Kuh-i-Kilgird and the distance to the point of final descent from the Sarak is 2f miles. The road will now have to decend on to the Malamir plain, a fall of 1,150 feet. To accomplish this, keeping a maximum gradient of 1 in 20 will require 4J miles of road. The slope of the mountain is fairly good, but it is all rock, there are several ravines which might be utilized to facilitate the descent. The distance across to the Ahwaz side of the plain is 5 miles. Explanation of quantity sheets. Number 1 — Kms.

Concessions for roads and railways in South-West Persia. The Peisian Transport Company whose shares are held privately in the names of the shareholders of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany and the Imperial Bank of Persia own the concession for the Tehran to Ahwaz and Mohammerah ehaussee with a branch to Bumjird and Ispahan. The chaussee has been completed from Tehran to Kum and Suitanabad. The more important provisions of the concession are— (a) The Persian Government is entitled to 20 per cent, of the net profits. {b) The Company is said to have the monopoly of the transport service on the road. (c) Uncultivated land is granted gratis. A good deal of misconception exists in regard to the interests of the Persian Transport Company in the existing Ahwaz-Ispahan Caravan road. Ihis is chiefly due to the road being known as the “ Lynch road ” which has given rise to the impression that Messrs. Lynch Brothers own the concession, and that they transferred it to the Persian Transport Company along with other rights. This is,, however, not the case. The concession was obtained direct from the Persian Government by the Bakhtiari Khans, and the only interests in the undertaking, which Messrs. Lynch Brothers were in a position to dispose of, are limited to—• (a) The option to find any further capital required by the Bakhtiari Khans for the improvement or conversion of the present caravan road. (b) The right to collect the tolls on the present road as a collateral security for the repayment of the money advanced to the Khans for the construction of the road. The sum outstanding on the road construction account is one which the Khans could easily afiord to pay at any time and the Persian Transport Com pany’s interests in the present Ahwaz-Ispahan road consist only in their right to advance the capital required and carry out the construction of any conversion or adaptations of the present track from a caravan into a cart road. As however the present concession is not one that would cover the cons truction of a motor road or railway and even if in consequence the Khans applied for a tresh concession it is an open question whether the Persian Transport Company’s right to advance cajntal and carry out construction would still remain valid. , On the other hand the Persian Transport Company as the inheritors of Messrs. Lynch Brothers interests, may be said to jiossess certain moral claims and a vested interest, in that they were the pioneers of this route, have always been closely associated with its development, and this year displayed some initiative in sending their engineer to examine the new alignment. The only other stake that the Persian Transport Company jiossess in South- M est Persia is a half share in the Persian railway syndicate. Shortly after the latter was formed and obtained the option for the construction of the Khorremabad line, the Persian Transport Company pointed out that the proposed activities of the railway syndicate would lie an infringement of their rights. As a result of their representation the Foreign Office suggested to the Persian Bailway Syndicate, who agreed, that they should admit the Persian Transport Company to a half share, viz., to subscribe £15,000 of the £30,000 capital of the syndicate. Turning now to the rights and interests of the Bailway Company syndicate. As already stated they have obtained the option for the Khorrema bad line, which however requires renewal, and in 1913 they incurred con siderable expenditure in connection with the preliminary surveys. FurtherI 36 m the fact that they have come to an arrangement W ith he Persian Transport Company, practically assures them an open field in Lunstan. Tt has a i re adv been mentioned that there should be an amalgamation of interests in South-West Persia. Perhaps the most promising means of hr n An- this about would be for the parties interested to extend to the Bakluiari country the principle of amalgamation already successfully applied in the case of their Luristan interests. A round table conference m London should be able to reconcile any divergence of views or interests, if such exist. S. G. P. 1,-186 F. d P.

Army Commander’s consideration is requested in regard to the last paragraph. The position is briefly this. After exploring Kuh-i-Mangasht last summer, Captain Noel recommended it as a practicable hill station for troops. The Persian Transport Company (Messrs. Lynch Brothers) now propose, as a commercial enterprise, improving the Ahwaz-Ispahan mule road into a cart road The project will be a costly one, and in considering their Engineer s esti mates they would be glad to know if anything is likely to come of the suggestion for a hill resort for troops at Kuh-i-Mangasht and, if so, whether they may expect any co-operation or contribution from us, i.e., from Army Commander, if question for hill station is of immediate concern to this Force, or from His Majesty s Gov ernment, if the question is a post-war one. On general military grounds, it is no doubt in our interests to have a cart road as far as possible on the route from Ahwaz to Ispahan. What seems to be needed is a telegram from Army Command er to India mentioning Noel’s proposal regarding Mangasht and the Persian t rans port Company’s present project, and giving his views as to the desirability of any military contribution to the Ahwaz-Pul-i-Shalu section on grounds either of present or post-war expediency. « Enclosure 2.

The Army Commander sees no pos sibility of being able to utilise a hill station ir from where the bulk of troops are located during the continuance ot tne war2. He is not, therefore, prepared to recommend any military contribution towards the conversion or construction of a cart road in that vicinity ; though he has no objection to it provided it is commenced from the Ahwaz end. 3. It is obvious that the conversion or construction of a military road from the Ispahan end, especially with our communications not so developed, might be objectionable from a military point of view.

Mr. Balfour is, however, fully alive to the real importance of improving the trade comnunica- tions in southern Persia, and His Majesty’s Govern ment would be prepared to afford their full support, short of actual financial subsidy, to any scheme which may reasonably contribute to this ooject. Mr. Balfour understands indeed that the Persian Railway syndicate are themselves contemplat ing the introduction of measures to improve trade comnunications in southern Persia, and it is un necessary to observe that Mr. Balfour would regard with 7t sian Transport Company, Limited, 3, Salters Hall Court,with great satisfaction any identification of your scheme with that of the Persian hallway iiyndicate and that the support which His Majesty’s Government may be able to give to these projects in general would naturally be more effective if the two important British firms interested therein v/ere in a position to combine in the matter. 1 am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) &amp; tfra/iam.FUBEiaH CPFIOS, ^uly Z7th, 1917. Dear Lir. areenway: With regard to your letter of the 18th ultimo, relative to the ithwaz-ispahan road, 1 write to say that oir C. luarling has expressed the opinion that the proposed alignment, which would bring the road n&amp;ich further soutti, vwuld expose it, much more than is now the case, to attacks from the iCuhgelu tribes and that it is doubtful Whether the dakhtiari Khans would accept responsibility for the protection of traffic unless some special arrangement were come to for the provision of more efficient guards. It is feared also that the original Jakhtiari road concession, Which concerns a track that is oeing^ constructed and used for nearly twenty years, would scarcely cover the new project and that a fresh con cession or at least a large modification of the old one would become necessary. I need hardly assure you that we are most anxious wOpV ^ivate.anxious to do all we can to prepare in advance for a constructive improvement in the trade comnunications in couth i-ersia and I must tell you that we would welcome a combine between your syndicate and the Persian Transport Company which would at least identify the Interests of the two British groups most interested in the subject. We have indeed intimated to the Persian Transport Company that such a combine would be welcome.\ Immediate and Confidential.

With reference to the statement in the Company’s letter of the 29th ultimo that some form 1 of Government guarantee would be necessary for the capital to be expended, to explain that when a representative of the firm called at this Department and made a similar suggestion, he was told categori cally that no hope whatever could be held out that His Majesty’s Government would entertain any proposal of this nature in any case during the present war. Mr. Balfour adheres to this, opinion and assumes that Hr. Chamberlain shares his view. It appears, however, to Mr. Balfour that great benefit to British interests might he derived if the Ahv/az-Ispahan road were rendered possible for motor or light railway traffic.

The Persian Transport Company Limited/^ 3, Salter’s Hall Court, Cannon Street, E.C. r ' t • . ( London. 29th. May 1917. With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of road enterprises in Persia, and in reply to your letter W74535/17 of the 18th, April, I am instructed by my Directors to submit this Company's view on the nroposal to construct a road suitable for vehicular traffic through the Bakhtiari hills from Ahwaz to Ispahan. We desire, in the first place to remove the impression, which it would anpear from your letter W60152/17, the Government entertain, that we origin ated the proposal to bring this scheme to light at this juncture. We understand the late Captain Rankin recommended the scheme in 1914 and it has been follow ed up by Captain Noel, His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul at Ahwaz with the support of His Britannic Majesty's Legation at Teheran, and we be came actively associated with it when r. Botham was sent to examine and report upon the alignment and cost of the road at the snecial request of Bir C. Marling. Inasmuch as this Company control the vehicular roads between Teheran, Kum and Sultanabad, and con template constructing a road between Kum and Ispahan, under the Teheran-Huhamerah road concession, and re ader Secretary of State cognising Foreign Office, London, s.W.l.recognising the importance of providing a connection to these roads from Ispahan to the Persian uulf via Ahwaz, we regard.the scheme as deserving of ser ious consideration ty His Majesty's Government in the interest of British and Persian trade. Before however, entering, into the details of the construction of the road between Ahwaz and Ispahan there are fundamental points connected with - Vi&lt;- 1 w n i n Company's powers to deal with. Holding the opinion that no road scheme which does not provide tetter and more rapid ipeans of transport than pack animals and horse drawn vehicles, can he made to pay its way, or materially improve transport facilities in Persia, we consider ■ . ' 1 « the establishment of a Motor Transport Service on •the Roads should be regarded as an essential part i of the scheme. On seWeral occasions when the subject of running Motors on the existing roads was mooted we have been informed by His Majesty's Legation at Teheran tnat the Russian Government might raise objections. Having regard to the fact that this Company 1 hold a concession granted by the Persian Government prior to the signature of the Anglo-Russisn Agreement which gives the, right to 'a) construct vehicular roads or caravan tracks between Teneran and Mohamerah via Khorrainabad, Shuster and Ahwaz, , t X ) and between Kum and Isnahan, (b) ran a vehicular . service either animal.propelled or otherwise over the roads already made or to be made,(c) chargecharge tolls on the made roads and (d) monopolise the vehicular traffic on the roads, we respectfully submit that it would be difficult to discover any v * r justifiable reasons for the Russian Government . • \ * . r * to object to the construction of roads into Ispahan or the running of Motor services, on the plea that that town is in its zone of influence. We are informed that the Persian Government strongly advocate the establishment of Motor • * services on the existing vehicular roads for the purpose of facilitating communications in Persia and incidentally with the object of securing a portion » i . * of the profit derivable from the running of such services. This Company’s connection with the section of the route between Ahwaz and Ispahan has been confined to carrying out the terms of the Agreement with the Bakhtiari Chiefs for the construction on their behalf of the caravan track now known as the 'Lynch Hoad'. The Bakhtiari Chiefs hold a concession from the Per sian Government which empowers them to charge tolls on the traffic going over this track. i On the assumption that this concession would be absorbed by the new and larger scheme to construct a vehicular road through the same territory the ! Bakhtiari Chiefs should experience no serious dif ficulty in getting the Persian Government to extend its scope to the levy of tolls on vehicular traffic. Prom a preliminary examination of the financial c. c aspectaspect of the scheme it seems clear that it _ | would 'be imoracticable to finance tne scheme throughJ private channels f ind that some form of Government guarantee would be n ecessar y for the caoital t&lt;D be expended on the Bakhtiari vehicular road. We understand from our Teheran Agents and from other sources connected with Persia that ids Majesty's Government are prepared to regard the project in a favourable light, -e ar 1 continuing our investigations of the scheme and will prepare details of an estimate, meanwhile we venture to enquire whether His Majesty’s Government can see its way to offer any further “observations on the points referred *to above. We have now received Mr. Botham's preliminary report of his examination of the alignment of the vehicular road. This alignment is about 50 miles longer, but has the advantage of following a lower altitude through the Bakhtiari hills than the caravan track. In one place only is vehicular traffic likely to be interrupted by snow during the winter, and taking it on the whole we are t of opinion that a vehicular road constructed on this alignment would be suitable for the purposes required. The steepest grade is one in 20. The estimate of cost of construction is Ispahan to Malamir. Tomans. 842,478. Tomans. - 165.0122. 1007.478.equivalent to £201,495 at Krs. 50 per £ sterling exchange* The estimate cost of taking the road from Malamir to Dera-Khazina on the Ah-i-Gergir instead of Ahwaz is £32,900 less, hut we have not yet received any evidence which enables us to discover that the smaller cost will offer compensation for the formidable disadvantages of breaking bulk and portage at Ahwaz entailed in the transport of merchandise from Muhamerah to the Upper Karun, and the difficulties of navigation of the Av-i-Oergir, if Dera-Khazina is made the Southern terminus of the vehicular road, as has been suggested. 1 am, etc., Tor The Persian Transport Company Limited, (Signed) Fred.

On a recent trip down from Teheran, Captain Noel (Ahwaz Vice Consul) and Sotham (Lyncha 1 Road Engineer) discovered a new alignment between Ispahan and Ahwaz, w ich they say is immeasurably superior to that of the present r6ad. Noel is at present engaged on writing a report on the subject, a copy of which I will send you in due course; briefly, however, the alignment is Ispahan to Lupulan along Lynchs 1 present road, thence a- long the South bank of the Upper Kama to Kaleh Tul, just before reaching which, the only really steep gradient is encountered, viz the crossing of the Kuh Mangaaht. ?rom K uleh Tul the road works into the Labari Plain, which it follows to Ab-gah (Betwand) and thence via Bar-i-Khaz- i .a to Ali az. The cost of putting this proposed road into good order, and the tima required therefor, is so say Noel and Sothara (with both of whom I have discussed the subject) small, and Sotham is now on his way back to Is- pahan to commence work im ediately. The intention is, so soon as the War is over, to start a motor lorrie and car service, and to lay a light railway later on, ij. experience shews this to be commercially justified. The parties at present interested in the road are, I understand, Lynchs, The Imperial Bank, and Lord Inchcape, and Noel tells me that it was particularly desired that A, P. 0. C, should also acquire an interest. The reasons for this are : (l) the proximity of the road to Iviaidan-i- Naftun, &amp;c,, (2) A.P.O.C.’s connection with the Persian Railways Syndicate - now apparently a thing of the oast : p^eenway,35sq.(3) the desirability for extending the market for/31, P,o,C, London.. . product* to Ispahan* (4) the fact that fuel re quired for the traction on the road, would, of noseosity, be tan u$u . • product* Hoel enquired what I thought would be the directors 1 views in this regjO'd, i;o itich I replied that I felt pretty sure that the proposal would be regarded favourably by you, and that 1 would write and obtain your views. Apart from the big political advantages which our participation in the ^chcaae would afford ul, the com &lt; rtial ad v; ant ages entailed would bo considerable. The maiibcr of berries (and/or cars) which it is proposed to allot for the service is 200 - these would be taken over from the ilit- ary after the /or - each ? ould consume about 10 gallons of petrol -nor diaa, say it total of 7C&lt; ,000 gallons a year* AS regards the Ispahan Oil aarlcstt this is said at the pres* . ent tine to take roughly K ,000 oases of kero sine per annum, a figtire w^iioh would doubtless be largely increased if pro- nerly taken in hHjru' • 'o meet these requirements it would, of course, be necessary to erect s small .©finery at .iaidan- i-Haftun, Hahdar, or sane other spot on the Perth cm section this of the Pipe-line, but/I think is bound to cou© in time,even If It consists on! o a siwpl# plant, something on ths lines of the top im api aratus at present ut Ah was. One other point in connection with this scheme which merits study is the effect i*hich such a road would have on our -ields trams' ort* 3ctwand, as you ore aware, is the half* way House on our road, between or-i-fhasineh fmd IPiJLdan-i- Kaftun, and were we to contract with the Transport Company to carry all our requirements between Bar-i-Khasinsli and Ab-gah, this would enable us to concentrate our own con veyances on the Ab-gah/'uaidan-i-Haftun Section : ws could also, if we so desired, sell out our interests in the former section to the Transport Company* or, perliaps,hmd it over in part settlement of whatever shares we de cided to aice up in t&gt; at Company* lumy other minor points occur to me in connection with this scheme f but, until I haaro your views on the main re position, I do not suppose you will wish to he troubled with details. Noel has asked me to write him as soon as I receive your reply to this letter and I trust to hear from you in due course that you regard the matter favourably.

I. possibility of making cart road from Ispanan to ivlalamir via Lurdegan and negotiating; with Khans with view to fortnation of transport Company. II. If above diversion is not feasible to convert present Lynch Road from Ahwaz to Ispahan into a cart road and negotiate with Khans for contrp] of tolls and formation of transport Company. Minister is wiring to Foreign Office for their views as to whether having regard to Article 3 of Concessions given to Khans by Persian Government and Article 3 of Agree ment between the Khans and Lynch of wnich Persian Govern ment has taken official cognizance it would be possible to proceed with conversion into a cart road without the Khans having to go to Persian Government for a modification of concessions. Minister points out tnat Russians will probably object to project on tne ground tnat it will foster our commercial penetration into the Russian sphere and as such be consi dered as an unfriendly act. If this objection holds good we could still push on with project from Couth as far as fcaxri border of Ispahan Province. Present transport rates could then be reduced by 75 per cent by adoption of scheme I and by 60 per cent by adoption of scheme II as far as Ispanan border.

T-l, dated 27th June 1916, K VuJ- from Cantain S. Noel, Hie Britannic Majesty*yConsul, Adwaz, to Chief Political Officer, Banrah. Last Marcia 1 submitted a report on a possible site for a hill station to tae North of tne uil Fields on the otner side of the Knrun. At tne time of visiting tnis locality, I was, to a certain extent, handicapped by ay geograp]iiciil knowledge of Bakntiarl country, ana al«o by tne shortness of tne tine at uiy disposal. Ivloreover 1 was predisposed to tae locality in question owing to the advunt?iges wnich would appear to follow the establishment of hill st-tion as an off snot to tne oil fields. These advantages were fully dealt with in my previous report. Hince that report was written 1 have nad the opportunity of visiting the Uangnsht range, which It will /A be remembered was referred to an altermtive site. This range would appear to be more suited for the location of a hill station than the country to the north of the fields. Vfater find vegetation are more plentiful and tne hill tops for the most part ar^e gently rou:ided or flat topped. Unfortunately owing to the local trouole between BaKntiaris and huhguieis, I was unable to visit u*e actual summit of tue raiige^l0,000i , but from a very tnorough enquiry frora all available sourceis I came to tne conclusion that tnere exists on tne top of the Mangasnt a plateau of many square miles in arep* abundantly supplied with water and grazing. The actual are- I visited is known as the Mor 1 Talkh, which is an oilier ridge of tne Mangasht r' nge. Prom the description whicly append it will be seen that it forms a very suitable site for a hill state station, nevertt -leas loc i foiides and lliat encamped on the spot assured me tnat it could not nold a candle^ to the higher plateau.DESCPIFTION OF THF MOR I TAiKH SITE FOP A HIlL STATION IN THE MANGASHT BARGE* POSITION. 10 E sq D 2, 2 miles tc the Ea*t of the final A i^ Zan^ina.

The crest of the ridge varies from 8400 to 7200. The mean height of the site for the station would be 7500 ft. The N.W. face of the ridge is precipitous, but on the S.B. side, the ground after falling steeply for 400 to 600 ft. slopes away at a gentle angle for half a mile to a mile and a half, thus forming a gently sloping and undulating terrace of about two souare ^iles in area at a mean height of 7500 feet. Future De- As stated above the Mor.

From six perennial springs giving an aggregate discharge of Water. 12,000 gallons per 24 hours. There is obviously a big catchment area which in all probability could be relied to furnish a very much larger volume of water if tapped at other points.

Security. from the surrounding migratory tribes, also many hill fruits obtainable in autumn such as blackberries, rasberries, walnuts etc.. Grain, flour and fodder in plenty from the lower valleys and the Kalieh Tull plain. Fruit such as figs grapes, pomegranates and plums in abundance from lower valleys which are very fertile and well watered. Ahwaz to Salmieh over the Arabistan plain forty miles by car. Salmieh to Alkhurshid by the Lynch road, 43 miles through low foot hills. According to an estimate made by Major Morten P.fl. this section of the road could be adapted to motor traffic at a cost of £ 25,000 ( Vide p.30 Military Perort on B.ft. Persia, Vol.III). Alkhurshid to Eulawas ( at the foot of the Mangasht). An easy alignment over the plain, construction of motor track should not cost more then Ps. 3,000. / epums to kce imm- A very fair mule track exists but there are one or two places over which it is difficult at present to get even a lightly laden mule over. It would, however, recuire very little work to convert the present track into one which fully laden mules could negotiate with ease. Going easy, it took me six hours to descend with a lightly laden mule from Mor I Talkh to Bulawas, but I think it should be possible to obtain a better alignment such as that suggested on the accompanying rough sketch. The,ascent and descent On the present track there is water in plenty up to 6000 feet. The site in euestion is the property of the sons of the late Khuda Kara* Khan of Kaleh I Tull. This family has always been on th° h^st of terms with British officials, and its present representatives would be ready to assist in every §ay. The protection of the station from a r =.iby the iaibi section ot the Kuhgelus would have to be considered, but should offer no practical difficulty as the Mor I Talkh is oniy accessible from the Mangasht by a single and difficult track. 3n any case it should be auite easy to deal with the Taibi by getting the Char Lang to occupy the pasturages surrounding the Mor 1 Talkh. Normally the Mangasfet plateau is shared by the Char Lang ana Aukgelus, but this year owing to strained relations between the Khans and the Kuhgelu chiefs and the fact that fcne Char Lang have practically no sheep left after the ravages of loot ano mouth disease which was so prevalent a&amp;s&gt;i year in the Eakhtiari country, the Mangasht plateau is more or less deserted. This state of affairs is exceptional and there should be no difficulty in arranging for the occupation by friendly tribesmen of such portions of the plateau as would impose an effective barrier between th® station and possibly unfriendly tribal elements. The above remarks are of course made on the supposition that the Khans would consider the proposal favourably. To the South the view is entirely unimpeded. The Mor 1 Talkh overlooks th* whole of the Arabistan plain from Rarauz. To Shushter as well as the Eakhtiari Garmesir from Mamatain to the Oil Fields. General Considerations. The position of the proposed site on a hill rising direct from the plain is an obvious advantage from the point of view of facility of communication. The fact that there is a mass of higher grounds in rear ensures; (a) Possibility of further extension fb) A reserve of water sjipply (c) Increased general at3ractiveness owing to possibility of makinr excursions without having to descend to lower altitudes. Sd. !.Noel # Captain, H.M f w Vice Consul, AhwazCopy of a letter* dated 29 th June, Malamlr, from Captain S. Noel, H. U'* Vice-Consul, ,\hwaa to Captain Wilson, D.C.P.O. ft In your report on the Bakhtiari country Nortli of the Karun river (Vol« 3 of the military reports on S#W* i f i si a series) you state on page 30 “TUis low hills section, Salmieh to Malamir, could be utilized, but at a conoiderabl cost; say Rs. 35, 000 ^ I have looked up lortons report but I cannot find any mention of the figure R' • 35,000, which to me seems very low, ie.

Mo. T I. The Manjpjasht is much better off as regards water and vegetation than the average of the hagros range, moreover it seems much cooler and does not conform to your bj/ degrees per 1,000 feet rule. At 3,500, in the shade on the banks of the Bulawas river the maximum temperature was 76, while the maximum under the trees away from the river was 87. j.he joaximufri temperature on the same river lower do^n at 3,200 was 60. I might mention that the degree sheet of this part of the country is entirely out. The Bulawas instead of rising up near the Barm i Shah 1 Mangasht as shown, has its source neaf the surmit of the Mangasht I should say about 2 miles N of the point marked 10687. It breaks out of the Mangasht system 6 miles E of AlKhurshid. I followed the stream up for about 15 miles from Bulawas. The scenery is magnificent. A succession of narrow precipitous gorges and small open valleys. The water is extensively used for irrigation and there are a succession of pomegranate fig and apple baghs along the banks for the first 6 miles. Where there is no cultivation the stream flows through heavy brakes of wild rhodadendron and blackberry, while along the waters edge there is an almost V W. ‘ ■*almost continuous line of fine shade trees chiefly banyo and chinsr all festooned with vines. At the 12th mile from Bulavas at 4200 feet the tk river breaks out of a magnificent gorge up which I managed to penetrate with the greatest difficulty for about i of a mile but waa finally held up by precipitous rock faces. I wae informed that the source of the stream is similar to that of the Karun i. e. a fountain sprimr breaking out of the eide of the mountain and descending the first few hundred feet as a waterfall. I made this little expedition in the company of one of the Bahmei chiefs, Zakhi Khan, who seens a very reasonable sort of fellow arid one to keep ones eye. he promised ne that next year, if X came up to Kaleh Tull 20 days after the Id he would take me into the very heart of the Kuhgelu country. Just at present he is in bad odour with Muhtashan over the recent robbery, so nothing can be done in this line. o Very hot at Malamir under canvas (115 to day)may be noted that m the Trans Persian Iway was under icussion the Russian rernment said that I would claim the it to build a line n Yezd to Kerman. [Kerman is on the d^r of our sphere, it as Ispahan is on i border of the isian sphere. P-2873/14 *Both of these ar i e the Russian sphere I do not think we ought to admit that 'Russian Government might with justice object if road actually terminated in Ispahan'. That they will object is possible: that they can reasonably claim that Ispahan, because it is in their sphere, shall b° cut off from access from the south is quite a different proposition and ought to be combated. The compromise suggested by Sir C- Marling vis. that the carriage road should stop at Bakhtiari limits would surely go a long way to deprive the concession of value. Our books and maps do not show the exact point at which the Lynch road passes out of Bakhtiari into Ispahan limits, but it is S-W. of Madraseh, and t must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kavarukji i.e. about 50 mil^s S.W. of Ispahan. From the point of view of transport would it not be highly inconvenient to have to break bulk, end rather absurd 50 miles from the destination 9 As regards Julfa, which is on the opposite (southern) bank of the river to Ispahan, Sir W. Townley in despatch No.163 of 10th June'14 spoke of it as 'being in the neutral zone'. Apparently it has a Persian Governor of its own, and in a memo, handed to the Russian Ambassador on 10th June'14 H.H.G. complained i nter alia that | 'Persian Governors, as at Resht,, Kazvin* , and at Julfa (Ispahan), are practically chosen, or at . . any rate maintained in their office by the Russian consuls'.l Consuls'. 7h e Russian Government in replying did not go into detail, but pointed out thatwe exercised the sameirieiit in Seistan and the Kainat (memo, enclosed in Sir G. Buchanui s despatch No.215 of 11th July/14). It is just possible, therefore, that they might dispute our contention: but we should insist upon it. According to the Route Book the last stage oi the road into Ispahan* is already more or less 'carriageable': 'carriages occasionaly drive out 'from Ispahan over this stage, but '’lie.: ? not) 'without adventures. But the track could witn very 'little work be made easy in dry weather'. It is just possible therefore that this new road need not be carried right up to Ispahan. r. rrahane who is now in this country could no doubt advise the Foreign Office on this. It is submitted that, it the matter must be proceeded with at once, application should be made to the Persian Government without more ado, and Russian objections be dealt with if and when they are raised. A number of important questions have been Grouping up very lately which make it very desirable that the Committee to consider the revision of the Anglo-Russian Convention should meet without further delay. If Lord Curzon’s heavy duties in the War Cabinet make it impossible for him to preside, perhaps some other Chairman could be found. (I1ITLD). A.H. 31.1.1917.
