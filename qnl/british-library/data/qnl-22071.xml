During the year, a large construction programme was underway to provide facilities for the production of aviation gasoline and increased quantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war. Certain phases of this programme were completed during the year and construc tion of the balance was proceeding rapidly as the year ended. Tabulations are presented showing (l) the status of all oil, gas and water wells as of December 31, 1944, (£) the monthly oil production and daily average water production by months during the year, (3) the purpose, size and type of all buildings standing as of December 31, 1944, and (4) the nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity of the Company at Bahrein on December 31, 1944, A map showing the location of wells, camps, pump stations, pipe lines roads and miscellaneous facilities is attached.PHOIXJCTNS FIKLD Note to printer Space to make heading atend out. D^T^LOP^TfT k HELL KSPAIR Activities in the Field during the year have been almost entirely devoted to the rehabilitation of those wells which were eliminated as producers during 194S in the Oil Denial Scheme* No work of a development nature has been undertaken and only minor repair work to individual producing wells has been found necessary. Progress in the rehabilitation programme has been more rapid than was expected and, in consequence, the Field has been returned to a state approaching its former degree of flexibility earlier than was originally anticipated. Thirtythree out of the total of fortyone wells included in the Denial Scheme have been rehabilitated leaving only eight wells to carry the programme to completion. Among the wells remaining to complete the programme, there are several which will contribute but little to the output of the Field whilst others require extensive work-over in addition to rehabilitation before they can be returned to production. One rehabilitated well was found, on return to production, to require major repairs and has been mudded off ponding an xx*h*x&amp;X* opportunity to carry out such work. Tabulation No.I shows the status of all oil and gas wells as of December 31, 1944, and Tabulation No.I&lt;rA gives similar data for water wells;- 9 • ir\ PROCUCTIOK Oil production during 1944 totellod 6,713,795 net barrels, an average of 18,344 net barrels daily. IXirlng the period January to October, both months inclusive, the rate of Field production was held at a daily average of 18,000 net barrels. In view of the improvement in condition resulting from the rapid progress of the rehabilitation programme, Field production was increased to 20,000 net barrels per day on November 1, 1944, and held at that rate during November and TTnr nmTui dtJMBgtSK. The rates of production from Individual wells have been subject to adjustment from time to time as additional wells were returned to production in the rehabilitation programme; these adjustments were designed to achieve the average Field production rates indicated for the periods referred to above. The rehabilitation of secured wells has corrected irregularities in the drainage pattern from the producing horizons by the provision of additional points of withdrawal over a greater area. Many of the wells returned to production, however, show marked decreases in productivity and further work will be necessary before their ability to produce is restored to that prevailing prior to the Denial Scheme. (US INJECTION The injection of gas into the First k Second Pays has continued throughout the year without interruption; the gas for this purpose was produced, ae in past years, from the Fourth Pay. The rate of injection, which is designed to control the advance of extraneous water into the oil bearing horizons, was increased in November coincident with the increase in oil production rate. The ratio of the volumes of gas injsctsd into First and Second Pays has remained constant throughout the year at a value which has been found suitable for present rsaervolr conditions.- 10 - SDCa vrATgl? gNGROACB'JSNT Water production for the year averaged 877 barrels per day as compared with an average of 595 barrels dally during 1943. The tabulation of oil k water (Tabulation II) production data £d3MB shows the dally average water production by months. The eratio rate of increase of water production indicated by the monthly figures is the result of the return of wet wells to production in the rehabilitation programme. The majority of these wells are situated on the flanks of the structure and formally produced water in varying quantities. A similar eratle reduction in water production was shown when these wells were eliminated in 1942. Individual well data indicate nomal rates of increase of water production and information derived from rehabilitated wells suggest a satisfactory water en croachment on the flanks of the Field.

The fire oil gathering stations which hare e combined capacity of &lt; o 5 f D00 bblsi. per calendar day haTe been in continuous service without major alteration or addition. A considerable improvement in the rate of corrosion of the oil collection and delivery lines has become evident since all buried lines were exposed approxi mately two years ago. ZELLAl T^y&amp;niNAL (Arabian Crude) Total imports of Areblan crude amounted to 7,137,773 net barrels during the year and this quantity was handled through the Zellaq marine receiving facilities. Zellaq Terminal equipment was augmented in 1942 to permit the handling of Arabian crude at the rate of 40,000 bble. per operating day in the event that we would be called upon to supply increased quantities of Navy fuel. These demands did not materialize and up to the present year the terminal has been operating very much below that capacity. /ith the increase in crude requirements brought about by the new construc tion programme, the existing equipment has been overhauled and augmented as e temporary measure to increase handling capacity to 45,000 bbls. per operating day. In order to achieve this rate it has been necessary to instal a 10,000 ft. loop of 8 ' pipe in the existing twin 4' pipe line to the Refinery. The Zellaq receiving facilities will become obsolete on the completion of the 12” crude line which is at present under construction from Arabia to the Refinery. The statue of this line is given later in this Report. GENERAL The segregation of the Bahrein it the Arabian crude systems was effected on tec^ ' )er 5, 1944, fHnd has been permitted by the provision of additional crude measuring and storage tankage at the Refinery. Any oo-mingling of Arabian and Bahrain crudes now takas place after separate measurement for Royalty purpose.- 12 - Note to orinter J- 3tart new HEHREHY A1{EA Turing the year under reriew e total of 13,725,226 bble. of crude were nroceased in the Refinery.

The new equipment is largely directed toward the production of aviation gasoline to the extent of about 6000 bbls./day together with increased quantities of other products. In addition, miscellaneous changes were made to certain of tha ®cl*ting plante for improvement in operation and in connection with increased throughput. The following sections covering refining facilities are therefore split into (A) plante operating prior to 1944 and (B) new plants completed or under construction in 1944. A - PLANTS OPERATING PRIOR TO 1944 . CHUTE P73TII1ATIOK UNITS N03.1 k 2 Note to printer i- Increase spacing to make main heading stand out. These units which have a nominal capacity of 17,000 barrels per calendar day each, operated during the year feeding mixed Bahrein and Arabian crudes. The only structural alterations mads were line changes and additions re quired to tie the units in with the new crude stilling and gaa recovery equipment. UNIT Hiia unit, having a nominal calender day capacity of 2500 bbls. operated throughout tha year aa required for rerunning acid treated extract for Ptower Kerosene manufacture.- 13 - No structural changes were mad# with the exception that the steam system was tied Into the new 110 lbs/sq # ln. steam loop line. STABILIZER This unit operated In the normal manner until September when It was shut down for structural changes required to tie the old equipment In with the new gas recovery plant, of which It then became an Integral part* SULPHUR PIQXIPa TREATING PLaNT During January three new pumps were Installed In the following services t- 1* Raw distillate feed 2* Sulphur Dioxide 3* Cold Distillate These pumps replace smaller units In the same services to Increase the capacity of the plant to handle increased kerosene distillate production. Nominal capacity of the plant is now 4,500 and 8,100 bbls* per calendar day when feeding 1st and 2nd grade distillates respectively* Other than the above, no addltlona were made to the Plant/which operated normally during the year* LEAD SULFIPS TREATING PLANT The gasoline and kerosene plants In this rroup operated normally during the yeaxy sweetening gasoline and kerosene production at required rates* No alterations were made during the year* GUY VAPOR TREATING PLANT This plant,which has a calendar day capacity of 4,700 barrels, operated normally during the year feeding acid treated cracked naphtha for the production of motor gasoline* In order to inoraaao capacity and eliminate soma of the difficultlea en countered In pumping out the bottoms product, a larger regulator valve and run-down line were installed during May* ACID TREATING PLANT3 The gasoline treating plant which has a nominal capacity of 6,000 bbls* par- 14 - calendar day operated normally, feeding cracked naphtha, during the year with only minor alterations. The kerosene extract plant also operated normally throughout the year feeding kerosene extract for Power Kerosene production and again only minor alter ations were carried out. The nominal capacity of the kerosene extract plant is 3,100 bbls. per calendar day. ACID MhNOT?AGT ljniNCr PLOT The original nominal capacity of this plant was 20 tons of H 2 SO 4 per day which was more than sufficient to meet previous requirements. The installation of the aviation gasoline facilities has necessitated the installation of new acid manufacturing and concentration plants which are discussed later in this Peport. In addition to these new plants, the capacity of the existing plant has been increased to 25 tons per day. The plant was shut down for approximately three months to carry out the necessary alterations and was returned to operation in September. Operation following these alterations has been entirely satisfactory. Rayo^JINQ UNIT One structural change was made during the year and consisted of the installation of necessary piping and connections on the furnace to permit cleaning the coke from the tubes with steam and air, accompanied by application of heat by controlled firing of the furnace. Previously the cleaning was done at the expense of considerable labour using air-driven knockers. The new method accomplishes the Job in about half the time formerly required. This plant has a nominal oapaolty I of 6,500 barrels per calendar day, feeding heavy straight run gasoline and re forming at essentially maximum severity. POffBR PLANT Increased power requirements for the new aviation gasoline facilities necessitated the expansion of steam and power generating capacity.As stated later in this Report, a new power plant la baing built in the south of the refinery, and,- 15 - In Addition, No.l Power Plant was expanded by the Installation of the following equipment i- 1* A new 3000 K*W, turbo'-generator set oomplete with necessary auxiliaries. 8 * A new 8300 rolt 4-penel switchboard and 2300 volt reactor. 3* The boiler feed water system was expanded by replacement of the three hot-well pumps with larger pumps and accessories. 4. Three new Westinghouse evaporators and auxiliary equipment. 5« Additions to the Water Treating Plant including a pressure filter a chemical mixer, chemical and water pumps, backwash tanks, and miscellaneous meters and valves. 6 . Extensions to cooling water and condensate lines and steam headers, and the installation of miscellaneous meters and regulator valves. 7. Extension of the Power Plant building and basement to house the new generator set and related equipment. The new steam lines were placed in service during August, and the new generator set was put into operation during September. With the addition of these facilities the Plant now has a nominal rated capacity of 11,000 K.W. CPACKING PLANT This plant is composed of two Dubbs cracking-coking units each having a nominal charge capacity, when operating to produce so-called liquid coke, of 6,800 barrels per calendar day. The unite operated normally during the year with the exception that both coking sections wars off stream for considerable periods for major repairs to coks chamber linings and insulation. Alterations mads during the year consisted of the following 1. The installation, on both units, of new 5-etage centrifugal hot oil pumps to replace the old reciprocating pumps which had corroded to the extent that the blocks required replacement. The existing turbines were altered and reused. 2. The installation of additional condensers and condensate pumps to handle the increased steam requirements for the new pumps.- 16 3. The InatallatIon of a new pltoh line from the units to the earthen storage sump. POLYMERIZATION PXANf This plant has a nominal feed gas handling capacity of 275,000 cubic feet per hour, with an operating liquid feed rate to the deethanizer column of 165 bbla. per hour* The plant operated during the year on two stage selective butene polymeri zation, producing an average of 11,000 bbls. per month of high quality polymer which was shipped to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co« v s refinery at Abadan for hydrogeration and subsequent use in 100 ootane aviation gasoline manufacture* The installation of a 4' regulator valve ; to relieve excess gas to waste In the event of a sudden pressure increase on the gas feed line, was the only addition to the plant equipment made during the year* Work was started on the installation of additional caustic handling facili ties required to Increase the capacity of the existing recovery equipment which will be used for recovering caustic returned from various other plants connected with the new facilities* DEHYDRATOR This unit operated normally during the year as required for recovery of the slop oil production* LIMB KILN The nominal capacity of this plant is 5*7 tons per day. Operation during the year was intermittent, being scheduled as necessary to handle requirements* No alterations were made to the plant during the year* STBAM-JI2T HSFRIQBRATIQN PLANT This plant operated part of the year refrigerating the Refinery drinking water and supplying cold water to the Laboratory air conditioning system. Changes made consisted of the installation of an additional condenser for the jets to improve the operation of the plant, and the replacement of the make-up precooler with a more efficient unitLABORATORY In order to house the testing equipment necessary for the control of the new aviation gasoline plants, extensive alterations to the Laboratory were completed daring the year. These alterations consisted of the complete rearrangement of the interior of the existing building and the erection of an additional Laboratory to house the octane testing equipment. This building is an extension, and includes part, of the old oxygen plant building. srm taiwinal &amp; 'HAjy Alterations and additions made at the Terminal to facilitate handling aviation gasoline and increased volumes of other products were as follows i- 1. New ethylizing facilities for motor gasoline. This equipment, the Installation of which was started in 1943 and completed during this year, consists of a new building housing an 8,500 gallon ethyl weigh drum installation and a storage platform with 300 drums capacity. 2. Dye pot for dyeing gasoline. 3. New 5,000 barrel per hour aviation gasoline shipping pump. 4. i&amp;xtenslve additions to the tank farm lines and the pumphouse manifold system. 5. New 18 11 aviation gasoline loading line to the Wharf. 6 . Extensions to both the pumphouse and the control room to house the additional pumps and control instruments. 7. New transformer substation necessary to handle the increased power requirements at the Terminal. 8 . Additional tankage, the details of which are given under the heading 'Tankage &amp; Lines' in the new plants section of this Report. 9. A pump and loading Rack were installed to load 100 octane gasoline into tank trucks for transport to Muharraq. This gasoline le imported and held in storage in Tank No.921, which, together with one of the loading lines, is under contract to the Air Ministry. At the Loading Wharf the only additions made consisted of the Installation of the new 18' loading line mentioned above. However, extensive repairs were made to the wharf structure as necessitated by damage resulting from two collisions occurring during berthing of ships early in the year. Repairs were complete by the end of the year and the structure is again in good condition.Note to printer Not necessarily s new page but increase spacing to make main heading 18 stand out B - NM PLANTS COMPLETED OR UNDER C0NSTRUC3TI0N IN 1944.

A low head pumping plant having e nominal capacity of 75,000 g.p.m., situated south of the Refinery and on the end of a raised flume which extends from the shore approximately ?,000 ft. out to sea. The water is discharged into this flume and flows to the shore where it is conducted by means of an open canal to the Refinery. 2. A high head pumping plant of similar capacity located at the other end of the open canal which terminates near the southern boundary of the Refinery. The incoming sea water is pumped by this plant into a buried reinforced concrete pipe distributing system with 3. A separator system which removes oil from all used water leaving the Refinery and an open canal running parallel to the inlet water canal, which discharges that watsr into the sea. A new three stage crude unit having a nominal capacity of 25,000 barrels per day was completed and placed in operation in November. The unit consists of Atmospheric and Vacuum main towers each equipped with a separate furnace and miscellaneous product strippers; the main overhead gasoline stream la rarun in a separata column. The main products are light and heavy gasoline, kerosene, light branches running to the various refinery units. NO.3 CFiUPE UNITand intermediate diesel, a heavy gas-oil cut for charging to the new catalytic cracking unit and residuum. All products have separate lines, pumps, etc., for discharge to storage or to the next unit for subsequent processing. chtos avn RacoyaEfr plant A new unit incorporating the fomer straight run gasoline stabilizer was installed to process all of the gas and light gasoline from the three crude stills. This unit consists of an engine driven compressor to handle the gas, miscellaneous caustic scrubbers for the removal of hydrogen sulfide and mereaptans and a two stage stabilization system. The principal plant products are debutanized light gasoline, a butane cut for aviation gasoline manufacture and fuel gas. This unit went into operation during the latter part of October but will not function to maximum advantage until the plants now under constmotion are operating. NO.8 Pomp PbiNT A new power plant is under oonstruotion in the south part of the refinery to meet steam requirements of the new facilities. This unit consists of two Riley Boilers (Nos. 5 k 6), each having a nominal output of 80,000 Iba/hr. of 550 Ibs/aq.in. superheated steam. In addition, a 3,000 K.W. Generator will be installed at this plant during 1945. No.5 boiler was completed during November and No.6 boiler was substantially complete as of the end of the year. butane ibomsrization unit An isomerization unit designed for a nominal capacity of 1,100 bbls. per operating day, equivalent to 880 bbls. par calendar day, was under construction and nearing completion as the year ended. This plant will employ catalytic means for transforming pure nonaal butane into isobutane. The plant consists primarily of numerous surge drums, washing, contacting and super-fractionating towers. It Is anticipated that this plant will be placed in operation during January 1945. ALKYLATION UNIT An alkylation unit utilising the cold sulfuric acid process was nearing- 20 - Os) couplet ion on nocombor 31, 1944. Tbia plant la daaignad for a nominal capacity of 3,750 bbla. of buteno alkylate pep operating day which is equivalent to 3,000 bbls. pep calendar day. It will proeeaa all of the butene olifin fractiona re- covered from thermal cracking and reforaing and catalytic cracking sources and combine those materials with isobutane from the isomerisation unit to produce a crude alkylate which ia subsequently rerun and treated within the plant area to produce finished alkylate for blending to finished 100 octane aviation gasoline. In order to provide cooling necessary to permit operating the alkylation plant at the required low temperature, a compressor house containing equipment for the production of about 1,600 tons/day refrigeration le being built and this is nearly completed. It le anticipated that thie plant will be placed into operation during February 1949. mw ACID MANUFACTtJRINfl AND HaCOVaHY FACILITIES \a mentioned above, the alkylation prooees uses sulfuric ecid and this involved a requirement ©f (1) new acid exceeding the capacity of our old 20-ton manufacturing plant and (2) equipment to recover the spent alkylation acid. Accordingly, acid manufacturing equipment having a nominal capacity of 35 tons Hg304 par stream day is being provided oonsieting of increasing the present 20-ton plant to 25 tone as previously mentioned plus the building of a new 10-ton plant along with acid recovery facilities. The acid recovery facilities being Installed have a capacity of 123 tons per stream day. Thie equipment was substantially complete as of the end of the year.

AND CAUSTIC HSMTiSRATIWO MTIPriOT Preliminary fabrication and foundation work in connection with the alterations of these plants for use in conjunction with the new facilities have been completed and the balance of the work is awaiting a plant shutdown. This shutdown is dependent on the completion dates of the alkylation and Isomerization units but is anticipated during the latter part of January 1945.• 21 FIXJID CATALYTIC CRACKINQ PLaNT A two stag* fluid catalytic cracking unit ia being built for the primary pun&gt;oee of producing the aromatic base stock necessary for the production of 100 octane awlatlon gasoline* This unit will hare a nominal capacity for charging 12,000 bbla. per stream day and produce about 3,500 bbls./day of finished aromatic blending stock* The remaining products will consist of a light and a heavy cycle gas oil which will be used in the production of diesel and fuel oils* At the present time it is expected that this unit will be completed and ready for operation about April 1945* QAS CONOffifFRATION UNIT FOR TH3 FLUID CATALYTIC CRACKING UNIT This plant in reality is the recorery, stabilization and rerun section for the fluid catalytic cracking unit* It will serve the same function for the cata lytic cracker light ends as the altered polymer plant will serve for light ends from thermal cracking and reforming units* All the fixed gases produced by the catalytic cracker will be processed though compressors housed in an extension to the same building containing the alkylation plant refrigerating compressors* The function of this unit la to recover all the hydrocarbon fractions which ere capable of further processing* The equip ment consists of some 3,600 H*P* of compressor capacity to handle the gas production together with absorbers, stabilizers and seven fractionating columns each equipped with its own furnace* At the present time, it is expected that this unit will be completed at about the same time, or slightly in advance of, the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit. AVIATION ACID TKSATINO PLANT The construction of this plant has been started* It is located adjacent to the present acid treating plants to combine this operation under the same supervision* The plant is dsslgned for two stage acid treatment and will have a nominal capacity of 8,350 bbls./day*- 22 - The plant la expeoted to be ready for operation by May 1945. caiym j, caustic dissolving punt This plant is substantially a duplication of similar equipment now installed near tbe present transfer pumphouse which is only sufficient to handle present needs. The new plant has been located in an area close to the points of caustic consumption and adjacent to the area chosen for locating the lead sulfide treating plants thereby centralizing operations of a similar nature. Ibis plant construction is well adranced and should be completed in February 1945. LSAD 3ULFXD3 TRSATIKQ PLATTS One new lead sulfide treating plant is being provided as a part of the new facilities. This plant is now nearing completion and will be ready for operation when required. It is designed to sweeten 1,500 bbls/day of a marginal blend stock prepared by de-nomal pontanlzing a special cut of light straight run gasoline. In connection with No.2 Reformer which will be constructed during 1945, a new reformed gasoline PbS plant of increased capacity (14,000 bbls/doy) will be installed and a small amount of work has already been done on the foundations. AVIATION OASOLINTi, ETHTU^INO AM) INHIBITING PL NTS Ihe installation of an 8,500 gallon capacity ethyl weigh drum and contingent equipment is being made to facilitate the handling of ethyl fluid and the ethylizing of aviation gasoline blends. The building in which this equipment is housed in corporates a shaded area sufficient to store about 300 drums of Ethyl fluid. The gasoline inhibitor plant is installed under the same roof in a separately enclosed comer of the building. Tt consists of space and aqulpment to ampty special gum inhibitors into blowoase equipment where a concentrated solution of tha inhibitor in gasoline will be prepared for subsequent addition to aviation gasoline blends in specified concentrations. Tha construction of both of these items is well advanced and should be•» 23 ~ oomploted In ample time for use when required. MI3C&gt;-XL.^N^0U3 FUMPHOUS^ Two pumphouse additions within the refinery were provided to handle the additional pumping load imposed by the new facilities. 1. The present so ealled 'sweet gasoline' pumphouse was amplified by four pumps of 500-750 BPH capacity to take oare of the transfer of Catalytic Cracker feed stock and product light and heavy cycle gas oil. 2. A special pumphouse located adjacent to the aviation gasoline Ethyl Ikiilding was installed to take oare of aviation blend stock transfers and blending operations. All finished blends will thereafter be pumped to finished storage at Sltra. Both nf the foregoing pumphouses are complete and ready for operation.

The principal electric feeder lines etc. are complete and in service except for additional changes and additions which will be made at the time the new generator, to be installed at No.2 Power Plant, is placed into operation. A new refinery telephone system with an independent switchboard has been installed and is now operating. Part of the telephones to the new plants are in operation and the remainder will be completed in the near future. A chilled distilled drinking water system has been completed with the exception of connections to various plants now under construction. Sanitary sewer services have been Installed and a part of these are now in operation. ffiSLDlNO AND MaCHINB SHOPS The extent and nature of the aviation equipment now being installed has necessitated the purchase of machine tools not heretofore available at Bahrein. Buildings to house such equipment are being built in the northeast of the refinery area. The framework of one building ie up and the other is in the process of ereetlon. It is anticipated that both buildings will be completed during the first half of 1945. MISCELLANEOUS BUILDINGS Within the new Refinery Construction Area a new dispensary building for Rupee Payroll fctaployeea was erected near the South Refinery Oate. Two additions were made to the Messhall building and an addition was mads to the Construction Office, both of which lie east of the Acid Manufacturing Plant. Three Staff Toilets, one east of the Acid Manufacturing Plant, one east of the Alkylation Unit and one east Of the Fluid Catalyst Cracking Plant, and two Native Toilets, one north of the Acid Manufacturing Plant and one south of the Fluid Catalyst Cracking Plant, were built. PIPELINE - ARABIA TO BAHREIN ISLAND Completed this year as s part of ths Refinery expansion programme was a 12' crude oil line running across Bahrein Island from the Refinery to a point on the&lt;0 £5- shoreline facing Arabia* At this point, junction is to be made with a 12** submarine line, now in the process of being laid, which will carry crude oil from Arabia« The transportation of crude oil through these lines is expected to start during the early part of 1945* In conjunction with this project, an oiled road has been built which follows the entire length of the land section of the pipe line. pmi iiAmn?ACTumm plot A drum manufacturing plant hawing a theoretical maximum capacity of 70,000 drums per month (basis 3 shift operation) was built and placed on a preliminary operating basis. A number of equipment items which haws not yet arrived, are still to be installed before the plant will be complete. At year*s end the plant was still operating in what should be termed the experimental stage. Itoallzatlon of full capacity probably will not occur until sometime in March or April 1945. DflPM FILLING PIAHT Drum filling facilities are being installed and Include two £5,000 bbl. stock tanks and a small slop tank. The filling plant will handle two products and has a rated filling capacity of 300 drums per hour or 3,000 drums per 10-hr. day. It is anticipated that this equipment will be finished and ready for operation during the latter part of January 1945. CAtTSKvUY In order to reduce the time in shipping and unloading the large tonnages involved with full operation of the Drum Plant and the Increased Refinery operating facilities, a 30* wide truck causeway is being built off Sltra Island. The new causeway runs along the south side and parallel to the sea lines to a point approximately 13,000* off shore where a pierhead will be built to handle 4 barges simultaneously in 0* deep water at mean low tide. It is anticipated that this causeway will be ready for use about JUne 1945.QMJfP yAOXLITISS MALI A &amp;£ room bunkhouse, complete with washroom and toilets and nine £4-room bunkhouses were built during the year. These were necessary for housing the construction force now in Bahrein and on the completion of the construction project these bunkhouses will be conyerted for other uses. Additions and alterations were made to the Awali Messhall to proylde messing facilities for the present manpower and for the number of employees anticipated in the future; additional dining room and kitchen space has been provided. \ The mall office, which in the past has been included in the Main Office, has been remored and a separate building has been constructed. The new building houses the Mail Office, a technical library and a records room. The growing Company facilities which necessitate increased personnel, hays made the existing main office inadequate. Alterations and additions hays therefore been commenced to provide more office space. The existing Laundry building has been extended to provide more laundry space. A dry cleaning room was also added. A third A.O. plant and cooling tower were built to provide air cooling for further offices and industrial buildings and for the construction bunkhouses. A portion of this will be available for future housing. The 13 new air conditioned married houses which were commenced in 1943 were completed; all were built with three bedrooms. ROTA Increase in the number of Company personnel employed at present and anticipated in the future, has necessitated extensions to the housing facilities provided for these employees. At the Raffs Camp four 14-room 'Rupees Contract Daily” Kraployees quarters were built, together with two combination kitchen and servants cjuartera and two washrooms and toilets. Four 'Rupees Non-Contract Daily' itaployees quarters, two kitchens and one washroom and toilet were also constructed.3XTHA - 27 - .tddltions ap# being nada to th® ^Fhipoos Non—Contpaot Daily' i&amp;iployees quart ops at 3itra Pi®r which houa® the Oompany marine personnel.

Qft-22 : On the 25th -arch 1944 the Company applied for a reservation of land from the Bahrein Government for the installa tion and maintenance of the Arabian-Bahrein pipe line, the reservation, containing approximately 110 acres, consists of a hundred foot wide strip from the boundary of the Company Reserva tion 0R-1A near the Refinery to the high tide line on the west coast of Bahrein; where it crosses private property, the strip of land was decreased to SO feet in width. The reservation, as far as State lands was concerned, was granted on 14th December 1944. Pitch Pond Property . JM&gt;: This property of 143.32 acres, on which part of the Company^ pitch ponds are situated, is divided into 120 shares and owned by the Abdullah-al-Gfoatam family.

DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND PORT OFFICER BAHRAIN*V Food Control Department The problem of providing suitable and sufficient food for the people of Banrain, was once again one of the main preoccupations of the Government., and during the year under review, in attaining this object., some 80 lacs of rupees were spent by the Government on the purchase of such essential foods as, viheat, flour, barley, rice, sugar and dates. The quantity of rice purchased was however only just over 400 tons, and was of Iraq origin, and for the majority of people wheat formed the staple diet throughout the year. Despite the lack of rice, in any quantity, there were no signs of malnutrition amongst the people, and there was a considerable decrease in the number of cases of Bacillary dysentery, attributed by many, to have been caused by the change in diet. The system of Food distribution, commenced during 1363? con tinued unchanged throughout the year, with few complaints from the public, against the shopkeepers. The cereal ration per adult, per month, was maintained at 20 lbs, throughout the year; but varied in quality at times, for example, at the beginning of the year, the ration was made up of 12 lbs wheat, and 4 lbs each of No.l flour and barley, in Jamad-al-Awal, and for the three ensuing months, the ration consisted of 10 lbs wheat, 7 lbs mixed flour and 3 lbs of rice. Commencing Ramadhan and until the end of the year the ration was made up of 12 lbs of wheat and 8 lbs of mixed flour. During the pearl diving season-,the crews were also issued with a ration of Jareesh ( crushed wheat ) and an unlimited supply of dates and date juice. At the beginning of the year and up to the end of Shaban, the sugar ration was 2^ lbs per adult living in the towns, and £ lb per adult in the villages, commencing Ramadhan and until the end of the year- the ration was increased to 3 lbs per adult in the towns, and one lb per adult in the villages.2 The reason for the difference in the rations, between the townsfolk, and the villages is that in the towns, there are large non-Arab communities who consume large quantities of sugar - whilst the villagers scarcely consume any quantity# The increased sugar ration was brought about by the arrival of the Governments increased quota, and it was no longer necessary to encroach on the amount set aside for public use - for sale for barter goods* Tea was in very short supply for the first half of the year, and it was found necessary, to ensure a fair distribution, to open Government Tea shops, staffed by Government employees and issue an equal ration to all. Just before Ramadhan, Bahrain’s 1943/1944 quota arrived and from then onwards the position was easier, and the public were able to purchase their requirements from the same shops from which they purchased their cereals. During the month of Shaban, there were a considerable number of complaints from the General Public, against the local butchers, for refusing to sell meat at controlled prices, and for withholding live stock from the market. At a special meeting of the Food Control Committee, called for the purpose of discussing ways and means of combating this practice, it was decided the best method would be for the Government, through the medium of the Municipality, to purchase all imports of live stock, and sell slaughtered meat in the meat markets direct to the public. For this purpose - salaried butchers were engaged and there have since been no complaints. Towards the end of the year under review, there was however, a distinct falling off in the quantity of imports, and it was found necessary, to conserve stocks, to slaughter and sell meat to the public on four days a week only*t 1\ - 3 - The Barter system, whereby Na^iiudhas importing such articles, as Live Stock, Ghee, Fire-wood, Onions, Potatoes etc, were allowed to export Tea and Sugar in similar value worked well, and there was a plentiful supply of most of these commodities, at reasonable prices, available throughout the year The Government continued to purchase one-third of various types of Indian Cotton Piece Goods, for sale at over cost, by the yard to the poor people„ The cost of living in Bahrain rose again during the year under review, prices -, and in particular those of piece goods reaching peak heights, as will be seen from the under-noted comparison of prices. A very strict control was again exercised on the export of all types of goods from Bahrain© Many arrests were made by both the Police and Customs Officials for attempted smuggling of sugar and piece goods© With the demand for labour increasing during the year, and the higher wages obtained, many instances of profiteering and hoarding occurred, due to the public preferring to pay the price asked rather than report the individual concerned. Those cases which were reported were all successfully prosecuted© Due to a considerable increase in staff, and to relieve congestion, tov/ards the end of the year, the Food Control Department, removed to new premises, with better facilities for the public, in the obtaining of their Piece Goods rations, and for approved shopkeepers their food supplies©CONFIDENTIAL Bahrain, 24th January 1945.

FREQUENCY OF SERVICES The frequency of services operated by the Corporation through Bahrein has been doubled during the year 1944,, The increase of passengers and cargo carried over this period is considerably in excess of this figure owing to the use of aircraft with greater payloads Ensigns' operating at an all-up weight of 52,000 (as against 42,500 lbs of the 'C' Class Empire Plying Boats) have been brought on to the Cairo/Calcutta route from the Trans-Africa lines. Sunderland services which operated to Cairo from the United Kingdom during 1945 were ex tended to Karachi and later to Calcutta. These aircraft are at present operating to 54,000 lbs all-up weight and their frequency is likely to be increased considerably. PASSENGERS The majority of passengers carried have been Service Personnel in transit of Bahrein. There has also been a considerable increase of passenger traffic to and from Bahrein, mainly in the form of Oil Companies 1 employees. Westbound aircraft returning from India have been operating comparitively light and it has always been a- simple matter to provide accommodation for passengers to Palestine and Cairo proceeding on leave. CARGO Cargo, likewise, has‘been primarily in transit of Bahrein. Considerable quantities of supplies have been received by air from India and there has also been precious cargo traffic of the pearl market and Indian currency for the Eastern Bank, Ltd. R.A.F. REFORS agreed with R.A.F. Transport Command the Corporation have been undertaking Flying Control duties and marine transport for all R.A.F. Flying Boats in transit of Bahrein. FUTURE OPERATIONS The fast service to Australia operated by Lancastrian aircraft will not normally call at Bahrein. This service will fly from England to Australia in 60 hours including halts. When the airfield at Muharraq has been suitably adapted to receive heavy aircraft, Bahrein will probaB! be an emergency halt on this route. The 'C' Class Empire Flying Boat schedule to be doubled and the Sunderland services will be speeded up and increased. N CONCLUSION The R.A.F. are experimenting in order to overcome the pr of damage caused to the runways at Muharraq by heavy aircraft. Un'* such time as t his is solved, it is unlikely that any large landplai will use Bahrein. The F/B base, however, appears to be an essential on the 7‘Qute to India and when it has been possible to blow up the cor*, obstructions in the alighting area, Bahrein will be the most suitabla w, base between Egypt and India.P2TR0LEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED P/CC.2/3902 Bahrain, 7th February, 1945 CONFIDENTIAL To H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. IS Dear Sir, ANNUAL REPORT - P.C.L With reference to your No.C/93 dated the 20th January 1945, we enclose herewith the report asked for, which we trust will be sufficient for your purposes. Should there be any other matters which you would wish to be included, we shall be pleased to send you the necessary supplements. Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED MANAGER Enel.CONFIDENTIAL PETROLEW CONCESSIONS LIMITED BAHRAIN SUWARY OF OPERATIONS FOR 1944 1. GENERAL It will be understood that Petroleum Concessions Limited, Petroleum Development (Q,atar) Limited, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited and Petroleum Develop ment (Oman and Dhofar) Limited are still in the category of undertakings that do not supply anything towards the war effort. As such it is very difficult, if not impossible, for them to obtain foodstuffs and equipment necessary to continue exploration. In war time, food shortages and food control have created a position in which it is very difficult for private concerns to attract the trained subordinate personnel they require in competition with the Services and Companies engaged on war projects who are able to issue rations to their employees. This situation appears likely to continue at least until the war with Germany is concluded. Efforts are still being continued, however, to organize geological parties on a small scale, and there is just a possibility that a party may be available in the Persian Gulf in the cool season of 1945/1946. 2. QATAR EXPLORATION &amp; DRILLING - 1944 (a) Situation at the end of December 1944 The state of suspension of oil operations in Qatar continued through the year 1944. Although towards the end of 1943 an application was made in London to the high authorities concerned for permission to resume operations, nothing materialised in 1944 beyond prepara tions by the Company to be put into effect if sanction to the resumption was received. As far as can be ascertained at present, it would seem that the reopening of Qatar remains under the category of a post war industrial project, and the Company^ application is still under adjudication. It is obvious that even after sanction, considerable time must elapse in assembl ing personnel and equipment for the rehabilitation and extension of the Qatar camps before actual drilling can be recommenced. Certain supplementary geological exploration is under consideration, but again this is dependent upon the Company T s ability to overcome war time difficulties and restrictions on foodstuffs and equipment generally. (b) Suspension Situation Vis-a-vis the Company and the Ruler of Qatar With the usual oriental indifference regarding the passage of time, the Ruler of Qatar has displayed very little impatience and no irritation on the question of the resumption of the Company 1 s operations. He does, however, assume that the Company will begin work at the earliest possible time after the war with Germany is concluded, and his latest forecast is the summer of 1945. It can be anticipated that when Germany collapses he will press for action* It may be added that the Ruler is leaning more and more on Shaikh Hamed, the heir- apparent, who is now definitely the power behind thethrone besides being spokesman. Shaikh Earned 1 s two protracted visits to Bahrain for dental and medical treatment, following upon the restoration of normal relations between Bahrain and Qatar, seemed to broaden his outlook to a noticeable extent. He became much less dictatorial and almost diplomatic in his approaches to the Company. (c) Administrative Problems - Qatar (i) Currency Up to the end of 1944 the Ruler was still insistent that his dues should invariably be paid in silver. Other Trucial Coast Rulers have all accepted in principle that notes are legal tender and no premium must be put upon silver. The Shaikh of Qatari contentions that silver is essential to his dealings with Bedouins and pearlers have all been disproved. He has asked for the annual concession payment of three lakhs odd for 1945 to be paid in silver, but it remains to be seen whether the Indian Government will sanction the export. The Ruler may be expected to take an unreasonable attitude if silver is not available. (ii) Food Quotas The Ruler’s disposal of his food quotas for 1944 gives rise to anxiety should Company operations reopen while the quota system is still in force. An obvious solution would be for the Company to be issued direct by the British distributing authority in respect of the rations due to their local employees, but opposition from the Shaikh to such a procedure is to be anticipated. There are also complications in the operation of such a scheme requiring the Shaikh’s good-will and genuine co operation to overcome. It is believed that the Political Agent has in view arrangements for the ^ reorganisation of the existing distritution machinery. If this reorganisation proves to be a success, the necessity for issues to the Company from ’’source'* might not arise. 3. TRUCIAL COAST EXPLORATION - 1944 (a) Attitude of the Rulers During 1944 the Trucial Coast Rulers with whom the Company have oil agreements appeared quite content to accept the position that owing to conditions created by the war, further exploration in their territories was impossible until the situation changed. It is probable in some cases at least that this complacency is due, to a large extent, to the money that reaches them as a result of the R.A.F. activities based on Sharjah, and, should this source of income draw to a close, a revival of interest in the Company’s programme is to be anti cipated. Incidentally opportunities for profitable transactions in foodstuffs arising in the early days of the war have almost, if not entirely, ceased.(b) Oil Agreements (i) Ajman During 1944 the Ajman option agreement expired and a suitable extension was obtained designed to give the Company reasonable opportunity to cope with exploration after the war with Germany is concluded. (ii) Outstanding Concession Areas During the latter part of 1944, outstanding areas came under consideration, and the position was examined in conjunction with the Political Agent, Bahrain. The Company’s Managing Director, London, was also in touch with the India Office on this question. It is understood that the negotiations with the Rulers concerned resultant from this review of the situation may be opened in early 1945. 4. MUSCAT AND DHOFAR The option periods for which provision existed in the Muscat and Dhofar oil agreements expired in June 1944, and the Company dispatched the necessary declaration to His Highness that it was their intention to take up the concession in both cases. The appropriate payments were made into His Highness’s account with the Eastern Bank, Karachi, thus fulfilling the Company’s obligations in respect of the transactions. His Highness the Sultan acknowledged by telegram receipt of the declaration. No further communications from him were received in 1944 on the subject of the taking up of the concession.

There was an increase in traffic accidents. Smuggling of tea, sugar, cigarettes and piecegoods continued owing to the high prices obtained for these goods outside Bahrain, 67 cases of smuggling were detected and convictions obtained, petty thefts also increased. During the year there were two cases of thefts of motor vehicles which were removed, stripped of the tyres and tubes, and then left in lonely places outside the town, Administration . Mr. W.B. Steele the State Ulngineer relinquished his appointment as State Engineer and Group Captain H.P.G. Leigh was appointed as State Engineer. Pearl Industry . It was not a successful pearling season. Fewer boats went for diving. Owing to the higher prices of foodstuffs the Nakhudas did not obtain a reasonable return for the money invested. The advances to the divers were as follows:- Diver Puller Tesqaam Es. 40 30 First salaf 40 30 First kharjieh 10 10 Second kharjieh 20 20 Second salaf 30 20 I4TJ naDuring the month of Ramadhan, which fell in the middle of the season, there was no diving. The average earning of a diver was itt.165/-. Public Works . Owing to the scarcity of cement and other building materials no building work other than repairs was done by the Public Works Department. Municipalities . The work of both the Municipalities was restricted to ordinary routine duties such as town cleaning etc. No new important schemes were carried out. The Municipalities took active part in rationing and food control working in close cooperation with the Pood Department. Agriculture . There has been a steady increase in the area of land under cultivation in those parts of Bahrain where water is available. The Government experimental garden is being extended and the Agriculturist continued to advise garden owners and cultivators on agricultural matters. Electric Department . The electricity undertaking operated continuously during the year, but during the month of November and December when weather conditions were bad o ving to heavy rain and winds there were 166 power distribution failures, all external. A connected load of 314 k.w. was added during the year. The new Transmitting Station of the Royal Navy was connected during the year (a connected load of approximately 35 k.w.). Also the R.A.B. have added approximately an additional 232 k.w. making their total connected load 246.5 k.w. at the end of the year.3 The electricity rates were not increased during 1944 in spite of war conditions and increased running and maintenance costs.

The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, approximately 293 points were added during 1944 as compared with 237 points in 1943 and 250 in 1942. Telephone Department . jSight new subscribers were connected in 1944, making a total of 104 subscribers on 1st January 1945. The new switchboard ordered in 1943 arrived during 1944 and is in use. The total capacity of the exchange is 150 lines. inquiries are being made by Messrs. Gable and Wireless in connection with the supply of a fully automatic system in substitution of the present manually operated one. It is considered that the installation of an automatic system would prove to be extremely beneficial to all subscribers and would eliminate the numerous unsatisfactory factor to which the present system is subject such as exchange delays, cross lines, unclear reception, etc. 8.

Further progress has however been made in the dividing up of the lower classes thus reducing still further the overcrowding in the Infants schools. The two events of outstanding importance were the sending of nine students for further education in Cairo and the engagement of thirteen trained Egyptian teachers. Early in the new year the head Master and Mathmatics Master of the Secondary school unexpectedly resigned for family reasons, thus reducing the staff to two. We were able to carry out the normal programme until the end of the school by the help of a senior clerk on loan from the Public Relations Office. The opening of the Secondary school for the new school year was delayed until mid November owing to the late arrival of the new Egyptian teachers who were unfortunately held up in Baghdad. There has been a steady improvement in the Infant and Primary schools which promises well for the future. The opinion of the Egyptian teachers is tnat the standard of those compares very favourable with that ol corresponding Egyptian schools, but that the second and third forms Ox the Secondary school are little better than the first. This is in accordance with the fact that the older boys did not have the opportunities that are now available to their younger brothers. Cultural lessons such as Drawing, Handwork, Library Work and General Knowledge arehaving a marked effect, as are the steadily increasing extramural activities. This widening of outlook, this direction of youthful energies is perhaps the most valuable contribution to the people of Bahrain that education has to offer. The difficulty of obtaining essential material for the schools has become more acute. It is possible to obtain neither paper nor chalk from India or the United ^ 5/— ..6/ ffi - 5 - Kingdom and our stocks are all but exhausted. No issue of paper for the use of students has been made during the past three months and it is necessary to ration chalk so strictly that blackboard work is rarely possible.

This applies not only to boys who have received some mechanical training in the school but also to young boys who would normally be of suit able age and qualification for entering the preparatory classes of the school. Only 25 boys offered themselves as candidates for admission to the school when the new classes were opened in October with vacancies for over 50. All the pupils who left the school at the end of the Tv- summer term after copleting a full course have entered employment consistent with their type of training. They are making satisfactory progress and are receiving adequate wage rates. One remaining student holding a scholarship from the Kuwait Oil Company left the school during the year. His record so far is less satisfactory than those of the nine other Kuwait students trained in Bahrain since 1941. A good standard of teaching has been maintained, the scope of the courses being chiefly limited by the shortate of equipment and materials which it has not been possible to replenish or supplement within the year. One member of theV - 6 - A Syrian staff has been promoted to the rank of Head Teacher with additional responsibilities to compensate for tine partial withdrawal of the Principal for other duties in the Government service.

THE RULER OF BAHRAIN AND THE AL KHALIFAH FAMILY (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad bin ^sa A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., interested himself clOvSely in the government of his country generally, and particularly in the maintenance of adequate food supplies for his people. During the period under review a rapproachment was effected between His Highness and Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim Al Thani, the Ruler of the neighbouring territory of Qatar. Difficulties had arisen as far back as 1936 with regard to the ruined settlemenc of Zuburah on the west coast of the Qatar peninsula which resulted in entry into Bahrain being denied to all subjects of the shaikh of Qatar except for those who were in urgent need of medical attendance. On the 17th of June 1944 an agreement was signed by the two shaikhs to the effect that formal relations would be resumed on the same lines as they had been in the past. The immediate result of the signature of this agreement was the lifting of the ban against the subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar by His Highness and the arrival in Bahrain for medical treatment of shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah /Al ThaniAl Than! the heir-presumptive to the shaikhdom of Qatar who was suffering from a serious infection of the face which kept him here,somewhat to the embarrassment of His Highness, for approximately five months. The agreement between the two shaikhdoms made it possible for several thousand unskilled labourers who were badly needed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Royal Air Force to come to these Islands and obtain employment. It was hoped that the vague terms of the agreement would preclude the raising of specific questions with regard to the ownership and dimensions of the Zubara area but His Highness indulged in long discussions on the subject, in particular with regard to certain armed guards in a fort within the area, with the Political Agent and towards the end of the year^ in not altogether profitable correspondence^ with the shaikh of Qatar on the same subject, (b) Shaikh Mohamed bin *lsa Al Khalifah paid his usual annual visit to Egypt and took his usual place in social events in that country. shaikh +Abdullah bin *lsa, C*I«S., his younger y ' . . brother and junior uncle of the Ruler was pi’esent throughout the year with the exception of a period of five weeks in the early winter during which he went to Saudi Arabia on a hawking expedition. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed a nephew of His Highness remained Superintendent of Police throughout the year while Shaikhs Mubarak bin Hamad and Dhaij bin Hamad, brothers of His Highness, continued to hold their appointments, the one as a judge of the Bahrain Junior JoinV Court and the other as a judge of the Bahrain Senior Court. Shaikh Ali bin Hamad one of His Highness* cousins held the appointment of a Judge of the Bahrain Senior Court, and arrangements were made for Shaikh Salman bin Mohamed a brother of the a- oruentioned Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed to undergo a course of legal instruction in Palestine early in 1945. His Highness* ‘ brother Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad was president of the Merchants Court and also of the Muharraq Baladiyah. / 4 .4.

Sixty seven cases of smuggling of tea, sugar, cigarettes, and or piecegoods were detected and the number of petty thefts increased. There were cwo cases oi very up-to-date crime when two motor vehicles were stolen and stripped of their tyres and tubes. The vehicles were recovered and in one case the tyres also and the criminals were produced in court. 5. AGRICULTURE There h^s been a steady increase in the area of land under cultivation in those parts of Bahrain where water is available. The area of the Government experimental garden at Budaiya was increased towards the end of the year and the Bahrain Government Agriculturist v/as available to advise garden owners and cultivators on agricultural matters. 6 . MUNICIPALITIES The municipal j^ork of both the municipalities was restricted to ordinary routine duties owing to lack of building materials. The municipalities, as in previous years, took an active part in assisting the Food Controller in che rationing and distribution of foodstuffs. PUBLIC &lt; QRKS Owing to the impossibility of obtaining cement and other building materials no fresh construction work could be undertaken and it was only with the greatest difficulty that urgent repairs were carried out. 8 . ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT (a) General The new transmitting station of the Royal Navy was con nected during the year (connected load of approximately 35 KW), /and- 5 - ,lv and the Royal Air Force added approximately 232 KW making their total connected load 246*5 KW at the end of the year. The charges for lighting and power were not increased during the year in spite of war conditions resulting in an increase in the running and maintenance costs. Comrected load on 31st December 1943 •• 770 KW Connected load on 31st December 1944 .. 1092.5 KW Maximum recorded load in 1943 .. 193 KW Maximum recorded load in 1944 .. 308 KW Total units generated in 1943 •• 7,37,472 Total units generated in 1944 ..11,44,115 Wiring of houses by local contractors v r as continued and a further 293 points vcro added during the year under review. In the latter part of the year bad weather conditions resulting in rain and high winds wore in part responsible for no fewer than 166 power distribution failures. It must be recorded that these failures were very largely due to the condition of the external circuits which are in urgent need of overhaul, replacements, and repair. The condition of the power house plant is far from satisfactory for the engines are obsolete and in urgent need of replacement. The present system of small generating sets is uneconomical and the power house is so under-powered that even v/hen the new 20C KW gene rator arrives from the United Kingdom, as it is expected to do in the next two or three months, there will not be a sufficient reserve of power to allow for essential overhaul of machinery. The Bahrain Government will soon be faced with demands for additional electrical power for air conditioning and lighting and they are being urged by the Agency to embark on a sound long term reorganisation plan designed to provide adequate generating power with reasonable reserves not only for their present demands but for future expansion. (b) Telephone Department The present telephone system is most unsatisfactory and the subject of general complaint. This is partly due to lack of foresight on the part of the electrical department in failing to make provision for adequate replacements and repairs, /andand partly to inefficient operation. Enquiries are now being made from Messrs. Ofele and Wireless Limited with regard to the possibility of their being able to instal and operate an automatic system. Similar enquiries made from the Director of posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan, resulted in an indication that it was unlikely that equipment could be made available from India. 9. PEARLING INDUSTRY The season was not a successful one. This was due in part to the month of Ramadhan, during which there is no diving, occurring in the middle of the season and in part to the small number of boats taking part. This in itself was due to the great demand for unskilled labour at attractive rates caused by the extensive building operations of the Bahrain Petroleum Compary and the Royal Air Force. Curiously enough there was a considerable rise in the price of the lower grades of pearls in the Indian market due to extensive buying in India and at the same time there was no corresponding rise in the price of good quality goods for the reason that the American and European markets are still closed, and large quantities of high quality pearls are being held in Bombay against an expected rise in prices on the cessa tion of hostilities in Europe. 10. CUSTOMS Imports during the year 1944 showed an increase over 1943 which combined with a general rise in the cost of goods resulted in a customs revenue of Ss.21,06,806, being the largest sum which has ever been received in the form of customs duties. N. . 11. FOOD CONTROL The Food Control Department under the supervision of the Director of Customs succeeded very efficiently in overcoming the problems of the provision and the distribution of food for the people. Some idea of. the magnitude of the undertaking { /can7 to# can 'be obtained when it is realized that no less than 80,00,000 were spent by the Government on the purchase of such essential foodstuffs as wheat, barley, flour, rice, sugar, and dates. in addition to this sum a further outlay was incurred by the Bahrain Government in the purchased of one-third of certain standard types of Indian piecegood? for sale at a price five per cent above cost to the poorer members of the general public. The greater part of the expenditure incurred by the Bahrain Government was of course recovered from sales to the public. The cereal ration was maintained at twenty pounds a head a month throughout the year but there were variations in the constituents from time to time to accord with the variations in the supply of the dif ferent kinds of grain by the Middle East Supply Council. Rice disappeared almost entirely from the menu whereas prior to 1942 the population of these Islands were almost exclusively rice eaters. in Owing to the failure of the winter rains/the season 1943—44 in South Persia the quality of the meat obtained from that country was of the lowest, and even then the quantity was much less than the local demand with the result shat there occurred meat shortages in the late summer and early winter of this year. Early in the year difficulties wicji the local butchers who consistently refused to sell meat at controlled prices resulted in the Bahrain Government themselves purchasing all imports and selling direct to the public through salaried butchers in the meat market. In the last quarter of the year the falling off in the quantity of imports necessitated a 'system of slaughtering only on four days in the week being introduced. control and anti-hoarding regulations issued both by this were to a large extent nullified by the apathy of the general 'blio and a marked disinclination on their part to inform cotton possibly not unlike many other countries excellent price Agency and by the Bahrain Government to prevent profiteering /against/14 8 against local dealers. An interesting table of comparison between prewar and present rates showing the percentage increase is attached to this report as Appendix 'A'. 12. SHIPPING The following is a comparative statement of ships using the anchoragesi- 1942 1943 1944 British • • 134 109 171 American .. 24 51 188 Dutch • • 1 10 24 Norwegian •• • » 2 21 10 Others .. • • - S 12 The total imports during the year amounted to 1,96,681 tons while the exports, exclusive of oil shipments, amounted to 1^:,^23 tons. Since the beginning of the year sixteen steel barges, four wooden barges, and three deep sea tugs were brought into commission by shipping agents. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, for whom Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; company act as agents, imported the following commodities during 1944:-- bugar •• 448 tons Barley .. * 2,149 ' Wheat .. 14,039 ' Flour .. 4,636 ' Rice .. 393 ’« 13. A C C IDENTS wITKIN THE PORT Two accidents occurred within the port limits during 1944. The first of these was the destruction by fire on the 11th of September of a launch belonging to Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited wnich was lying alongside the Royal Air Force pier on the MUharr&amp;q causeway. The sscohd accident, in some ways more serious, for the commodity was in extremely short supply in the Islands, w%£ when a dhow belonging to Ali bin Mohamed Omar Bazara of Aden ran aground north of Manama anchorage on the 26th of December and was severely damaged, the whole of her cargo of cement being a total loss.Q&amp;sy - 9 . 0 14. MEDICAL (i) Victoria Memorial Hospital Lieutenant M.L.A. Steele, held charge throughout the year with the exception of a period during the sumner / when Lieutenant Shyam Sunder of the Indian Medical Corps acted as locum tenens. 1942 1943 1944 Out-patients treated In-patients treated Operations (minor) 15,759 20,029 19,602 11 36 14 525 416 635 There were no epidemics during 1944 and it is interesting to note that there has been a steady decrease in the number of endemic smallpox cases since 1941. This is probably due to the very careful quarantining and vaccinating which have been carried out during the past three years. Malaria - There was a decrease in the number of malarial cases treated from 3,452 in 1943 to 3,279 in 1944. Most of these cases are considered to have been relapses from old . infections in persons who had not carried out a full course of treatment. The same applied to the venereal disease cases treated in this hospital and about which the medical officer reported the difficulty of persuading patients to complete a full period of treatment. (ii) American Mission Hospital Dr. Paul W. Harrison was in charge, assisted by Dr.W.H. Storm, Dr. J. Chandy, Dr. Mrs. J.H. Ames, and towards the end of 1944 by Dr. C.H.G. Mylrea, O.B.E. Dr. J. Chandy left in the early summer for a post-graduate course in the United States tov/ards the cost of which a very generous sum of money had been contributed by grateful patients. 1942 1943 1944 Out-patients treated 45,000 In-patients treated 1,165 • 10,610 2,030 14,124 2,879 1,122 major operations were carried out and 1,700 minor operations »s compared with a total of major and minor operations amounting to 4,300 in 1943. /TheThe Mission Hospital dealt with more cases of venereal disease during 1944 than in previous years. This is apparently due partly to an Increase in the incidence of the disease and partly to an increase in the desire of those afflicted for treatment. It is hoped that before long the very promising treatment by Penicillin will be available and within the afflicted financial limits of every^member of the general public. (iii) State Medical Hospital Dr. R.H.B. Snow held charge throughout the year assisted Miss by Dr*/ I.M.A. Doeg in the womens section of the hospital. Men^ Section 1942 1943 1944 Out-patients treated 1,13,838 1,29,379 1,27,503 ' In-patients treated 1,761 2,116 2,140 253 major operations and 1,908 minor operations were carried out as compared with a total for operations of 2,516 in 1943. The Service wards continued to be administered by the Officer-in-Charge of the State Hospital though of course the Royal Air Force medical officers and sisters were in charge of the actual medical teatment and nursing of the patients. Of the 410 European patients who were admitted only two failed to recover. Service out-patients are now dealt with by the Army and Royal Air Force medical officers at special dispen- saries opened for this purpose. Womens Section 1942 1943 1944 Out-patients treated 52,881 44,846 36,572 In-patients treated 759 778 927 74 major operations and 433 minor operations were carried out as compared with a total for operations of 524 in 1943. (iv) Quarantine Station. Muharraa Lieutenant M.L.A. Steele, I.M.D., was in charge as Quarantine Medical Officer except from 13th July to 14th October when the work was undertaken by Lieutenant Shyam Sunder, 1. M« G. /15i __ 15. POST OFFICE Mr. Rajab All held charge of the appointment of Sub-Postmaster throughout 1944. 1942 1943 1944 Registered letters received and despatched. 16,304 15,698 20,719 Registered parcels received and despatched. 7,771 4,547 5,504 The total receipts from the sale of stamps, postal orders, and money order commission in 1944 amounted to Rs. 1,16,401-7-6 as compared with Rs. 83,959-1-0 in 1943. Money orders to the total value of Rs. 7,60,524-0-6 were issued by the post Office compared with a total of Rs. 4,77,463-9-0 in 1943. Defence Savings Certificates to the value of Rs. 31,110-0-0 and Five Year Cash Certificates to the value of Rs. 74, 672-3-0 were sold during the year under review. 16. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE (1) Agency Courts The total number of civil suits and criminal cases decided during the year was 1,033 and 304 respectively as compared with 1,341 and 336 in the previous year. (ii) Bahrain Government There was no change in the personnel of the magistrates of the Bahrain courts during the year 1944. 17. EDUCATION (i) Boys* Section There has been very little increase in the number of pupils in the Boys* Section for classes were already full to capacity at the end of 1943. An innovation during the year was the sending of nine students for further education to Egypt and the engagement of thirteen trained Egyptian teachers. The work of the schools has been carried on in the face of almowt incredible difficulties for it has been impossible to obtain paper or chalk from India and the United Kingdom with the result that black boards can only be used on therarest of occasions and writing work had to be reduced to a minimum. (ii) Technical School There has been a considerable falling off in the number of students in the Technical School due to the abnormal demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers however immature their training. The teaching staff have had to contend with con siderable difficulties owing to a shortage of materials and instruments. The future of the Technical School was discussed with the Bahrain Government during 1944 and it is possible that the Bahrain petroleum company may be inclined to take over the institution with suitable reservations to the Bahrain Government in the way of a quota of scholarships for boys nominated by the Bahrain Government. Nothing definite could be settled as the Bahrain Petroleum Company are at present very pre-occupied with ik the abnormal war programme they have been called upon to handle. It is probable that in 1945 they will be able to put into exe cution a number of sound schemes for the benefit of the general population which they have been considering in theory during the past year and it is hoped that one of their first actions will be to come to an agreement with the Bahrain,Government regarding the Technical school. (iii) Girls* Schools The Girls* Section had much the same difficulties to contend with as the Boys* Section, There have however been very large increases in the number of students in the Girls* Schools, This is due to the higher standard of education brought about by the recruitment from overseas of skilled mistresses, and the realisation by the general public that an educated girl has much greater chances of making a satisfactory marriage.

THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED (a) General Management Mr. Ward P. Anderson was the General Manager and Chief Local Representative of the Company throughout the year except for a brief period in the latter half of the year when he paid a flying visit to the United States of Ameiica and Mr. H.B. Nichols, an Assistant Vice President of the Company, acted as the Chief Local Representative and General Manager. It has been the recent policy of the Company to ensure that a member of the directorate is present in Bahrain to obviate the necessity as far as possible of conti nual references to New York for decisions outside the powers of the General Manager. Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton the Chairman of the Company remained in Bahrain until 1st of June while Mr. H.B. Nichols was present from 21st June to the middle of November, it being understood that he would be replaced before the end of the year by Mr. Don J. Hanna one of: the Vice Presidents of the Company. • ■ (b) Production and Development The total oil production during 1944 was 6,713,795 net barrels, an average of 18,344 net barrels daily. During the period January to October the rate of field production was held * at a daily average of 18,000 net barrels but as a result of the rapid progress of the rehabilitation programme field production was increased to 20,000 net barrels a day from the 1st of November and held at that rate until the end of the year. During the year a very large construction programme was undertaken to provide facilities for the production of aviation spirit and to increase the quantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war. Certain phases of this programme had been completed by the end of the year and the construction of the remaining items was proceeding rapidly with every indication that the works would be completed early in 1945.(e) Producing Field Activities in the field during the year were almost entirely devoted to the rehabilitation of wells which had * been closed down in 1942 in accordance with the Oil Denhl Scheme. The progress of this work was more rapid than was expected with the result that the field was returned to a state approaching its former degree of flexibility earlier than had been anticipated. By the end of the year only eight of the original fortyone wells included in the Denial Scheme remained to be rehabilitated. No work of a development nature was undertaken and only minor repair v/orks were carried out to producing wells. (d) Import of Arabian American Crude Oil The total imports of Arabian American crude oil amounted to 7,137,773 net barrels and this was handled through the Zellaq marine terminal. In 1942 the Zellaq equipment had been augmented to permit of the handling of crude at a maximum rate of 40,000 barrels per operating day and although up till this year this high level was never attained it ?,?as found necessary in order to deal with increased crude requirements necessitated by the new construction programme to overhaul the existing equipment and augment the handling capacity to 45,000 barrels per operating day. As a part of the Refinery Expansion programme a twelve inch crude oil line running from the neighbourhood of Zellaq to the Refinery has been completed. The work of laying a twelve inch submarine line from the Arabian American Oil Company’s premises has been undertaken and it is hoped that the Bahrain Island section will be linked to the submarine line early in 1945 and that it will then be possible to pump Arabian American crude direct from the producing area to the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Refinery. (e) Refinery Druing the year under review a total of 13,725,226 barrels of crude were processed in the Refinery. Shipments of the15 - dp various products were divided % Petrol » • Paraffin •. • # Diesel oil .. # • Fuel oil • # Total w as follows:- 3,911,943 barrels 1,818,684 »' 2,409,788 « 2^14,568 « 10,254,983 barrels A detailed summary of the construction programme which has been in progress will be given later in this report. The new equipment is directed towards the production of aviation petrol to the extent of about 6,000 barrels a day together with increased quantities of other products. (f) Causeway The new causeway which is under construction is expected to reach a point 13,000 feet off shore where a pierhead will be built to handle four barges simultaneously in eight feet depth of water at mean low tide. The causeway will support a thirty feet wide truck road. (g) Camp Facilities Very considerable additions to tne existing accommodation both at Awali and at Raffa had to be made to house the large construction force which was imported to deal with the Refinery construction programme. A number of buildings such as for instance a fiftytwo room air conditioned bunk house, and nine twentyfour room air conditioned bunk houses will probably be put to use to increase the social amenities of the permanent staif as soon as the construction programme has been completed. The fiftytwo room bunk housex is expected to be transformed into the basic unit of a new hospital for the Asiatic employees of the company as soon as materials can be obtained. (h) Personnel The following is a summary of the personnel employed on the regular operations of the Company and the additional construction work in progress during the year*- Americans 770 British (O.K.) .. 150 Canadians .. 50 South Africans .. 68 Other Europeans.. .. 5 British Indians.. 707 Iraqis .. .. 127 Bahrainis • • 6,389 Others •• .. 1,150 (i) Royalty The royalty for the year amounted to Ks.28,64,453-3-0. /NewHCT? WORKS COMPLETED AMD IH PHOGKBSS AT IHK END OF 1944 (i) Refinery Power Plant Increased power requirements necessitated the expansion of the steam and power generating capacity. in addition to the construction of a new power plant to the south of the Refinery the principal addition to the present power plant was the installation of a 3^000 KiV. turbo-generator set complete with an additional 2,300 volt four-panel switchboard and 2,300 volt reactor. (ii) Second power Plant The additional power plant under construction was nearing completion at the end of the year and two boilers each having a normal output of 30,000 Ibs/hr. a.t 550 Ibs/sq.in. superheated steam has been substantially completed, and in addition the preliminary work was in progress on the instal lation of a 3,000 K.W. generator. (Hi) Sltra Terminal A dyepot for dyeing gasoline together with new ethylising facilities for motor petrol were completed. Extensive alter ations were made which included the completion of a new twelve inch aviation petrol loading line, extensions to pump houses and control rooms, additional tankage for 1,35,000 barrels and the setting up of numerous pumps and control instruments to bring the terminal into line with the Refinery expansion. (iv) Salt Water System In order to conserve the supply of fresh water the Company introduced a salt water system for the cooling of Refinery units. A terminal was built to house pumps with a nominal capacity of 75,000 g.p.m. two thousand feet out from the high water mark and a flume was constructed to bring the sea water from that point to the shore from where it could flow by means of an open canal to the Refinery. A further pumping plant was installed at the end of the aforementioned canal to distri bute water throughout the Refinery area and an exhaust canal /waswas constructed to run parallel to the inlet through which the water is discharged, after passing the oil separator system, into the sea* (v) Drum plant A drum manufacturing and filling plant has been con structed with a theoretical maximum capacity of 70,000 drums a month* This plant is intended to provide drums for the shipment of aviation spirit at a rate of approximately 40,000 barrels a month* (vi) Miscellaneous Of the large number of new units which have been com pleted or were in the process of construction in the Refinery and other areas the most interesting is a new two-stage fluid catalytic cracking unit which is being built for producing the aromatic base stock necessary for the production of hundred octane aviation spirit* This unit which is the only one of its size and kind outside the United States of America will have a nominal capacity of approximately 3,500 barrels a day of finished aromatic blending stock. VISITS OF BRITISH AND FOREIGN NOTABLES The exigencies of the Services and the war conditions prevailing brought many distinguished civil and military personages of many different nationalities to Bahrain during the year 1944. VISITS OF ARAB NOTABLES (i) On the 2nd November His Highness the Amir Saud bin Abdur Rahman as Saud a younger brother of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud came to Bahrain for medical treatment at the American Mission Hospital. He w^s present for a period of 25 days during which time he was successfully treated by Dr. Paul V/. Harrison. (ii) On the 5th May Shaikh Abdullah bin Sulaiman the Finance Minister to the Saudi Arabian Government accompanied by Shaikh Yousuf Yassin was forced by stress of weather to spend three- 18 - days in Bahrain enroute from Jedda to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz’s camp near Riyadh. (iii) Shaikh Hazza bin Sultan a younger brother of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi visited Bahrain from the 29th April to the 5 tm of .June'.. (iv) Shaikh Jumu bin Maktum a younger brother of the Shaikh of Dubai accompanied by numerous relatives paid a short visit to Bahrain in the month of May. (v) Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thaniof Qatar paid two visits to Bahrain approximating a total period of stay of five months during which he Tjmderwent prolonged treatment for a septic condition of the jaw. 21. LOCAL AFFAIRS (i) The Merchants Advisory Committee which was introduced in 1943 ’has functioned throughout the year with very con siderable success. (ii) In order to attempt to control rapidly rising rents a Rent Control Order was promulgated in Consultation with the Bahrain Government early in the year which provided for by the fixation of the percentage amount^/which rents could be increased, and contained regulations governing the circum stances in which landlords could insist on the vacation of* premises by tenants. (iii) No record of the events of the year would be complete without some reference to the climate. The summer was one of the mildest that has ever been known and was followed by a winter strongly reminiscent of the English climate, cold winds and drizzle interspaced with brief periods of sunshine. 22. ECONOMIC (i) Banking and Currency The most important event in financial and business circles during the year was the opening of a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran on the 16th of December. This branch had not been open for a sufficient length of time to have any very definite effect by the end of the year on the money /market19 - market but the immediate reaction to the introduction of a second banking house was the improvement, from the customers* point of view, in rates, and an unusual keenness to do business on the part of the Eastern Bank Limited. (i*) Eastern Ba nk Limited The business of the Eastern Bank consisted chiefly of financing the requirements of the oil companies operating in the area and the Service units stationed at Muharraq and Manama. For this and other general banking purposes they imported 2s. 1,68,50,000 in notes and silver and sold on India 2s.20,26,745 and to local merchants Indian funds amounting to Rs.58,25,000. It is interesting to note that of the fifty documentary credits handled by this bank covering the shipments of goods to Bahrain twenty of them amounting to £.15,000 covered goods from the United Kingdom, twelve of thorn amounting to 36,000 covered goods from the United States of America, while six of them amounting to 2s.98,000 covered goods from Indja. 23. BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION The increase in the number of services both eastward and westv/ard has been considerable and it is not unusual for three to four Sunderland flying boats to night stop in Bahrain. Unfortunately no proper accommodation exists for the passengers so that much discomfort has to be accepted by the many senior and distinguished civilians and Service officers travelling by air. The Royal Air Force pier, which is used for the operations of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, was extended to carry a motorable road, and terminal buildings were constructed to hold a restaurant and servicing offices on the sea-end. The Corporation*s accommodation on the landing ground of Muharraq Island still leaves much to be desired but it is understood that they are moving from their present weatherboard hut to more substantial and imposing quarters early in the coming year.20 24. MESSRS. CABLE &amp; TIRELESS LIMITED No works of importance are reported to have been carried out by this company during the year under review. Their numerous commercial and Service H services” were maintained, and there was a considerable increase in staff to enable further Service demands to be undertaken. 25. j&amp;SS Ro. PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited, Messrs. Petroleum Development (^atar) Limited, and Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited have made little progress during the period under review. At the end of the year operations in Qatar were still suspended and with the exception of nego tiations to obtain an extension to the Ajman Option Agreement no work was done on the Trucial coast whatsoever. 26. AMERICAN CONSULATE. :,KAHRAN On the 2nd September 1944 the United States of America after negotiations with the Government of the Hejaz and Nejd opened a Consulate at Dhahran. Mr. Parker T. Hart, an officer of the State Department of six years standing with the rank of Vice-Consul was the first Consular official to be appointed. Mr. Hart who is assisted by Mr. C.J.McIntosh paid regular visits to the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ premi ses at Awali, Bahrain having been included informally by the United States Government within his consular- jurisdiction. ROYAL AIR FORCE \ During che year 1944 there was an increase in the number of Royal Air Force personnel stationed at Muharraq 1 and in addition some two hundred men of the U.3.A.T.C. arrived in the early spring and early summer. This additional personnel was required in connection with the operation of the Far East reinforcement programmes botn for British and American aircraft. The Air Liaison Officer remained in charge of the Station but No.43 Staging post, to which more than ninety percent of the Royal Air Force personnel are attached, and21 the U.3.A.r.C. Staging Post remained under their respective commanders. Relations with the Royal Air force and the U* S*A«T*C* were conducted through the Air Liaison Officer and the same procedure was followed at Sharjah where a con siderable building programme was embarked upon to provide permanent accommodation for the personnel of the Royal Air Force and the U.S.A.f.C. stationed there. The effect of the abnormal rains on the Muharraq landing ground and the Sharjah landing ground towards the end of the year gave rise to much anxiety as Doth grounds were out of order for several days ac a time. As far as Bahrain was concerned the position was considered to be suffi ciently serious to warrant the introduction of a programme designed to overlay the main runways on the Muharraq ground *ith pierced steel plates. The work,which had been commenced at the end of the year, will have the additional advantage of strengthening the surface of the ground to enable it to be used for very heavy bombers.- 22 - T H U C I A L no COAST 1. TRUCIAL SHAIKHS (i) The following were che ruling shaikhs of the Trucial Coast during the yearx- (1) Dubai - - Shaikh £a»id bin Maktum, O.B.E. (2) Sharjah - - Shaikh sultan bin saqr (3) Abu Chabi- - Shaikh Shakbut bin Sultan (4) Um-al-Qawain - Shaikh Ahmed bin Rashid (5) Ajman - - Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid (6) Ras-al-Khaiiaah- Shaikh sultan bin Salim (7) Kalba - - Shaikh Hamad bin Sa f id (Minor) Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad (Regent) (ii) The shaikh of Dubai spent rather more than a calendar month in April and May in India to which country he had gone in search of expert advice with regard to his eyes. On the Shaikh^ return on the 28th of May he was involved in what might have been a serious mishap to the aircraft in which he was being flown. The aircraft developed trouble with its landing gear and was forced to land at Jiwani with the wheels up. Owing to the amazing skill 'of the British Overseas Airways Corporation pilot not only was no one injured but the twenty three passengers were scarcely even shaken. (iii) On the 19th of -April the shaikh of Sharjah went to India for medical treatment. His cure was somewhat delayed owing to speticemia following on the amateur efforts of his son Khalid to give the Shaikh the course of injections prescribed by his physician. After paying a visit to Delhi the Shaikh returned to Sharjah on the 12th of September. (iv) Shaikh Hamad bin Sa*id the minor Shaikh of Kalba was with great difficulty induced to come to Bahrain to be educated under the supervision of Mr. F.J. Wakelin the Director of Edu cation. After some preliminary difficulties the young man settled down satisfactorily in one of the primary schools, being lodged in the school hostel. On the completion of the school year on the 30th of June he returned to Kalba for the holidays apparently very willing to return on the re-opening of the schools in September. Unfortunately the return to freedom and the influence of his cousin shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah undid all /the ►— 23 *• the good which the visit to Bahrain had done and by the end of the year he had not returned and there seamed little likelihood of his uncle the Regent having sufficient force of character to insist on his doing so, 2w BRITISH IHTl^STb There is no doubt that the friendly relations which have existed for many years vd.th the Rulers of the Trucial Coast have now been extended not only to the more remote tribal shaikhs, in particular Shaikh Mohamed bin Ali bin Huwaidin the paramount shaikh of the Beni Qitab with whom our relations are now well established, but to the people of the towns and villages. The country is opening up and the inhabitants of the remoter parts of the interior are becoming accustomed to the sight of military vehicles, aircraft, and anti-locust parties carrying on their multifarious works and duties. 3. SHIPPING During the year under report there was some dissatisfaction particularly at Sharjah with the failure of the War Shipping Administration or whatever body was responsible to arrange for a regular service to the Trucial coast both from and to India. ^ The situation had improved towards the end of the year and it is recorded that a total of 38 ships called at Sharjah and the same number at Dubai during the period under review. It must however be borne in mind that a number of these vessels were military transports and naval vessels which put in exclusively on official business. 4. LOCAL AFFAIRS (i) Subscriptions towards the building of a hospital at Dubai had by the end of the year reached the considerable total of Ss. 1,93,007. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining suitable building materials, In particular iron girders and cement from India or elsewhere, no progress could he made other than the securing of an admirable site for the hospital. The funds « subscribed have therefore been placed in the National Bank of India in Bombay to await more spacious days.I 24 - (ii) In the early part of the year a comparatively serious smallpox epidemic occurred at Sharjah and Dubai during which several thousand vaccinations were carried cut. prompt action by the political and medical authorities resulted in the outbreak being rapidly brought under control. A further threat at Ras-al-Khaimah later in the year resulted in the vaccination of 2,400 people in the Ras-al-Khaimah — Rams area and the almost immediate control of the disease. (iii) Civilian motor transport, except in the case of a very few cars owned by the more important Shaikhs, has become a thing of the past on the Trucial coast. Lorries and cars which normally plied for hire were still awaiting spare parts at the end of the year and the donkey has once more come into his own. (iv) The companies formed at Dubai and Sharjah to organize the distribution of cereals and a further commercial body constituted specifically for the control of piecegoods have functioned with conspicuous success throughout the year. The companies dealing v/ith cereals have also been entrusted,under the general supervision of the British Political Authorities, with the operation of the barter system which is designed to encourage the import of goods not otherwise available locally 5 by and which are essential for the wellbeing of the people provi ding for export authorised quantities of goods in demand outside the Trucial Coast.
