A HANDBOOK OF MESOPOTAMIA Volume II IRAK, THE LOWER KARUN, AND LUR1STAN Prepared on behalf of the War PROVISIONAL ISSUE ADMIRALTY WAR STAFF INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (C. B. 294) MAY, 1917NOTE Mesopotamia is treated in four volumes. The first volume contains matter of a general nature. The other volumes are devoted to the detailed description of the river and land routes. The second volume covers the regions of the Shatt el-'Arab, Karun, and Luristan, and of the Tigris and Euphrates up to Baghdad andFellujeh. To the third volume are assigned the Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad and Fel- lujeh to Mosul and Meskeneh, the Lesser Zab, the country East of the Tigris towards the Persian frontier, and the routes running westward from the Euphrates valley across the Syrian Desert. The fourth volume treats of the country North of the line joining Eowanduz, Mosul, Meskeneh, and Aleppo up to Van, Bitlis, Diarbekr, and Mar'ash. All estimates of mileage must be considered as approximate only. In most cases they are based on the rough calculations of travellers, or on the times given by travellers, or on sketch-maps or incomplete surveys. The question-marks placed beside some of the figures indicate that these are peculiarly doubtful: it is not implied that other figures may be regarded as exact. It is necessary to emphasize the fact that in the circumstances the information given cannot be complete, and that conditions are con stantly undergoing change. The Admiralty will be glad to receive corrections and additions. Maps to accompany these volumes will be issued separately.ABBREVIATIONS In the itineraries the following abbreviations and conventional signs may be noted :— r. = right. 1. = left, h.w. = high water, l.w. = low water. I. = Island. T.L. = telegraph line. T.O. = telegraph office. P.O. = post office, m. = miles. The following signs are used to distinguish distance:—* by river ; t by road or track ; v crow-fly.

For movement by land the country is, as a whole, exceedingly difficult. Large areas are covered by permanent lagoons and marshes; others are liable to inundation in the spring and early summer; canals and irrigation cuts, which before the war were either unbridged or traversed only by light and narrow wooden structures, intersect the regions under cultivation; the alluvial soil is apt to become very heavy after rain ; and there are great expanses of country in which scarcity of water, either at all seasons or in summer and early autumn, prevents any considerable traffic or movement of troops. Hence the outstanding importance of the river routes for commerce and for military operations. In 1914 there were no metalled roads in Irak, and south of Baghdad wheeled traffic was used only on the roads leading from that city to Kerbela and Hilla. In Arabistan there were a few tracks north of Ahwaz, on which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company apparently used wheeled transport. Other tracks, leading across open desert or steppe, though passable for guns and carts either all the year round or in certain seasons, had been used only by caravans of pack animals. There was then no railway south of Baghdad. Approaches to Mesopotamia from —The only good approach to Mesopotamia from the Gulf is by the waterway of the Shatt el-'Arab, up which ocean-going steamers can ascend to10 INTEODUOTION Mohammareh at the mouth of the Karun and to the port of Basra. The only drawback to the navigation of the Shatt el-'Arab is Fao Bar outside its mouth (see it out c I A). From Basra to Kurna Bar the Shatt el-'Arab is apparently navigable by vessels of 11 ft. draught in the low season, and by vessels drawing 15-16 ft. in the months of high river. The channel over Kurua Bar seems to have a least depth of about 7 ft. in a low river and 13-15 ft. in the high-water season (see Eoute I B). As regards land communication along the Shatt el-'Arab, it appears that troops could march in the dry season from Fao to Basra on the edge of the desert behind the fringe of cultivation. Before the war the going on this track was made very heavy by rain, and parts of the road were liable to inundation in the flood season (see 1). On the 1. bank a little-used track, impassable after rain or floods, ran from Mohammareh to a point opposite Basra (see 3). Above Basra troops can apparently now march along the r. bank of the river to Kurna at all seasons (except possibly in exceptionally high floods), the intervening creeks being bridged (see 2). The 1. bank should be passable in the dry season or in moderate floods, if the larger intervening creeks and the Suweib River were bridged. In the low-river season the creeks S. of the Suweib could, it is said, be turned by a detour of some miles inland. After rain or floods the Suweib marshes would be either difficult or impassable. E. and W. of the lower course of the Shatt el-'Arab the country is mostly marsh or desert (sand and gravel N. of Koweit, alluvium elsewhere), and the coast is fringed with shoals and mud-flats. W. of the Shatt el-'Arab there are the following approaches to Basra from the Gulf, (i) It would be possible to land at Koweit Bay (see p. 401), and thence follow one of the comparatively easy desert routes which lead to Zobeir (see 23 d-a). The Shatt el-'Arab being excluded, this seems the least difficult entrance to Mesopotamia, (ii) Between Koweit Bay and the Shatt el-'Arab are the inlets of the Khor es-Sabiyeh and the larger Khor 'Abdallah leading to the Khor eth-Tha'alab and the Khor Zobeir, the head of the last-named channel being only about 11 m. from Basra. For details of these inlets see Boute I C. Landing from these Mors is apparently difficult in most places owing to mud-flats, marshes, &amp;c. On the W. side of the Khor es-Sabiyeh, the Khor eth- Tha'alab, and part of the Khor Zobeir, runs the desert-route Zobeir—Koweit via Umm Qasr (see 23 a, 23 d). NE. of the Khor 'Abdallah and E. of the Khors of Tha'alab and Zobeir there stretches towards the Shatt el-'Arab a desert largely liable to inundation in the flood season. The NE. shore of the KhorINTEODU OTION 11 'Abdallah is marshy. Boat channels are believed to lead from it to the Shatt el-'Arab (e. g. at Hamdan and Abu'l Fulus, between Moham- mareh and Basra). Between the head of the Khor Zobeir and Basra the country may be flooded in spring. E. of the Shatt el-Arab there is (i) the Bahman Shir Kiver, leading to the Karun a short distance above Mohammareh (see IIB); can be navigated by vessels of 7 ft. draught for 30 m. ; thereafter it is choked for the rest of its course (14-15 m.) by sandbanks, and is apparently now unnavigable for any craft larger than native sea going boats ; and even these can only reach the Karun with the aid of the high tide, (ii) E. of the Bahman Shir the coast is low and to a great extent marshy, liable to inundation and fringed with mud flats. Native boats can ascend the Khor Musa and Khor Duraq to Buzlyeh (in the Fellahlyeh district), the Khor Musa to Bandar Ma'shur, and the Hindlyan-River to Hindlyan village. The country round Fellahlyeh and Bandar Ma'shur is much intersected by water channels, and is liable to flood, and the land route leading from these places to the Karun in the neighbourhood of Marid is probably impassable for troops. The same is believed to be true of the whole route from Bushire to Mohammareh (see vol. iii, 54). More practicable would seem to be the routes from Bandar Ma'shur and Hindlyan to Ahwaz (see 66, stage 3; 62, stage 3 ; and 57). The Lines of the Tigris and th —The Tigris leads through Eastern and Northern Irak, the Euphrates along the southern and western edge of the alluvial plain. The greater part of the population of the country between Basra and Baghdad is to be found on and near the banks of these rivers. E. of the Tigris to the Karun, and NE. to the difficult hills of Luristan, the land is in general either marsh or open steppe. To S. and W. of the Euphrates ai'e the Arabian and Syrian deserts. Between the rivers the country is for the most part either swamp or waterless waste. Therefore all movement on a large scale from the Persian Gulf to the region of Baghdad is confined to the lines of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Of these the line of the Tigris is the more important, as that river is much better suited to navigation than the Euphrates. Along both lines land communication is difficult. On both, supplies of cereals, rice, and live stock are to be had in quantities varying from poor to plentiful according to the district and the year. The line of the Tigris (about 450 m. by river and about 300 m. by land from Kurna to Baghdad).—The river to Baghdad is navigable for vessels drawing 5-6 ft. in the flood season, and 3 ft. in low water. Navigation is variable owing to the changes caused by the12 INTRODUCTION annual floods. The difficulties are due either to shifting banks (especially between Kut el-Amara and Baghdad), or to narrow, short, and shallow reaches with sharp elbow-bends (especially between Kurna and Amara). See Routes III A, III B, III 0, and Appendix B. The country on or near the river banks is exceedingly swampy, especially in spring and early summer : it is also much broken by canals and irrigation cuts. In exceptional flood seasons the whole country between Basra and Baghdad has the appearance of a sea, with islands here and there. Between Kurna and Amara land communication is made specially difficult by the great per manent marshes which from 'Ozeir to Qal'at Salih come right down to the water's edge on both sides of the river. Before the war the river banks were here quite impassable for troops, but there is a practicable track from Kurna to Qal'at Salih now on the r. bank (see Route 4). Above Qal'at Salih the banks grow higher and drier. The r. bank from Qal'at Salih to Amara is much cut up by large canals, and the 1. bank is here the easier (see 4). Between Amara and Kut the banks are comparatively high. There are occasional patches of swamp near the river, and larger marshes farther inland. The size and depth of these vary according to the season. There is now a motor road on the 1. bank from Amara to Sheikh Sa'ad. (See Routes 5 a, b.) From Kut to Baghdad the 1. bank of the Tigris provides fairly good going throughout in the dry season, and the route could be made suitable for heavy motor transport with little trouble. The route is liable to inundation from March to June inclusive; irriga tion cuts and nullahs are still found, and the soil would make heavy going after rain, but the country is less swampy. (See 5 c.) The line of the Euphrates (about 420 m. by river from Kurna to Fellujeh).—The Euphrates is inferior as a waterway to the Tigris. So much of its water below the Hindiyeh Barrage is dispersed in branches and marshes that it becomes in parts very shallow in l.w. Moreover the Old Hindiyeh Barrage, at the head of the Hindiyeh Branch, forms at present a barrier to navigation, and even if this were destroyed, the locks in the new Barrage and in the Regulator at the head of the Hilla Branch would prevent the passage of the larger classes of river-steamer. Lastly, the New Hindiyeh Barrage was already before the war affecting depths in the river below it, and the Hilla Regulator could be manipulated to stop navigation on the Hindiyeh Branch in l.w. and on the Hilla Branch at any time. (See Appendix C.) The river between Kurna and Nasirlyeh (see IV A) is navigable in h.w. for vessels drawing 5 ft. In l.w. the shallows onINTRODUCTION 13 the Hammar Lake and on the bars in the channels near it have made navigation impossible except for small, or lightly laden, native craft. Conditions here are being improved by dredging. From Nasirlyeh to Samaweh depths are ample for river-steamers IV B). Above Samaweh the Hindiyeh Branch appears navigable, at least for steamers drawing 3-8^ ft., from about the middle of February to July. In l.w. the larger native craft cannot navigate the Hindiyeh except when lightly laden and assisted by portage. The Hilla Branch, if the regulator at its head were fully open, would be navigable throughout the year, at least for native craft: how far it would be practicable for steamers is uncertain. (See Boute IV C.) From Museyib to Fellujeh boats drawing 4 ft. can probably navigate throughout the year. (See IV D. Compare throughout Appendix C.) Land communications. —The edge of the desert along the S. and W. side of the Euphrates Valley gives good firm going all the way from Basra to Nejef, but very little is known of this route beyond Nasiriyeh. To that point, see Route 13 a, and for railway, p. 341. Beyond Nasirl- yeh (see Route 12) it is probably passable for wheels. Water is not plentiful beyond Shinafiyeh. Supplies are scarce or lacking except at Nasirlyeh and Samaweh. A disadvantage of this route appears to be that between Basra and Nasiriyeh, where the Euphrates flows through great lagoons and marshes, and again between Shinafiyeh and Nejef, where the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh has to be skirted, and the Bahr-i-Nejef either turned or crossed, it is not in close connexion with the river route. It may be noticed that the extension of the Baghdad Railway to Basra was planned to follow this line along the desert-edge. In the cultivated parts of the river valley below Samaweh (as between Suq esh-Shuyukh and Nasirlyeh) there are some tracks much intersected by irrigation cuts and liable to inundation in the flood season. From Samaweh the route along the Hilla Branch of the river past Diwaniyeh to Hilla is free from swamp, but is said to be much intersected by the beds of irrigation cuts and canals. There is very little evidence as to its character (see Route 14 and Appendix C). Before the war the following routes were reported as connecting the group of towns that lie on or near the Euphrates to the N. of Nejef and Hilla; from Nejef to Kerbela, an unmetalled carriage- road along the edge of the desert (see end of 21 a); from Nejef to Hilla, a track for pack animals (see end of 21 b); from Nejef to Tawarlj, a track passable in dry weather (see 16); from Tawarlj to Hilla, a track fit for pack animals (or, if some canals were bridged, fit for wheels in dry weather) (see 15);14 INTEODUCTION from Tawarlj to Kerbela, a track fit for pack animals, and possibly for wheels, in dry weather, but liable to be flooded (see JRoute 15); from Kerbela to Museyib, an immetalled carriage-road (see Boute 21 a); from Museyib to Pellujeh, a track along the river bank, which could apparently be made passable for wheels in dry weather with out much difficulty (see Boute 18). Routes from the Euphrates valley towards Ha'il and the Ne/d.— For a general account of these desert routes see Boutes 24 a and b. Lateral communications between the Tigris and Euphrates lines,— Between the junction of the two rivers at Kurna and the routes that join Hilla and Museyib to Baghdad, the least difficult line of com munication between the Tigris and the Euphrates appears to be the Shatt el-Hai; and this is in many ways unsatisfactory. In the triangle formed by Kurna. Amara, and Suq esh-Shuyukh, the great marshes which occupy about half the area apparently contain a number of canals which may allow shallow craft {bellams, &amp;c.) to pass between the Tigris and ^the Euphrates. They are generally much choked with reeds in the middle of their course. Little exact information is available as to their navigability. See pp. 121, 184-5, &amp;c. The line of the Shatt el-Hai, or Shatt el-Gharaf, connects Kut el-Amara on the Tigris with Nasirlyeh on the Euphrates (about 120 m.). There is cultivation on and near its banks, and a number of villages, two or three of considerable size, lie along its course. But the Shatt el-Hai is useless as a waterway in the months of low river, and even in a normal flood season has no navigable outlet to the Euphrates at Nasirlyeh. From Kut to Abu Mahau it can be used by steamers drawing 4^ ft. in the spring and early summer (February-June). For further details see Boute V. As to the land route between Kut and Nasirlyeh, the stage from Nasirlyeh to Suweij is under water in normal years in May—July, and the numerous irrigation cuts which intersect the banks of the Shatt el-Hai and carry^water from February to July would, no doubt, require much bridging and ramping to make them passable for wheels. The amount of supplies locally available would depend on the attitude of the local Arabs. For further details see Boute 19 a, and for connexions between the northern part of the Shatt and the Tigris between Kumeit and Kut see Boutes 19 b. W. and NW. of the Shatt el-Hai as far as the neighbourhood of the line Hilla—Baghdad, the country between the rivers is a vast alluvial plain with a very slight incline from the Euphrates to the Tigris. This region appears to have become much more arid than it was thirty years ago, when it was extensively irrigated by a number of canals drawing their supply from the Hilla arm of theINTRODUCTION 15 Euphrates. The water that came in flood-time from the Euphrates formed numerous and often large marsh-areas (Mors). The drying up of the Hilla arm apparently caused the canals to fail, and the marshland to decrease very considerably in extent: and the standing water of the Mors when not renewed from the Euphrates became more and more brackish. How far the restoration of the Hilla arm by the completion of the Hind iyeh Barrage has already affected the interior of this region is uncertain. The canals seem to have silted up, and much labour would be needed to clear them to any great extent. According to a Report of 1916 there is now water in the flood season along the whole line of the Shatt el-Khar from Diwaniyeh to Lake Butnijeh NNW. of Nasirlyeh, and boats can always pass from that lake to within 10 m. of a point two days' journey from Diwaniyeh. See further, p. 150. The plain is traversed by numerous ancient canal-beds, some of great size with high banks, and is dotted with mounds marking the site of ancient settlements. Here and there are shifting sand-dunes. The country is inhabited by a very sparse population of nomads and semi-nomads who here and there cultivate patches of ground near the Mors that still remain fairly fresh. Possibly there is also some cultivation dependent on the winter rains. Spring grazing is no doubt to be found. Water fit for drinking appears to be very scarce, especially in late summer and early autumn. For routes across this country see Routes 20 a, b, and appendix to 21 a. From Baghdad to the line of the Euphrates the main route is the carriage-road from Baghdad to Museyib. Up to the outbreak of the present war this was unmetalled, heavy in wet weather, liable to inundation in the first 15 m. from Baghdad (see 21 a). Between Museyib and Mahmudiyeh an unmetalled cart-road diverged to Hilla (see Route 21 b). There is also a route passable for wheels from Baghdad to Fellujeh (the first part of the Baghdad—Aleppo caravan-road). See Boute 22. It is reported that since the outbreak of the present war a Decauville railway has been constructed between Baghdad and Ridhwanlyeh (see p. 370). The Karun — Diz region. —The main line of communication through Southern Arabistan is the navigable part of the Karun River (see Route II A). The navigable Karun is divided into two parts by the rapids at Ahwuz-Nazirl. Below Nazirl the river is navigable for steamers of 2 to 5 ft. draught according to the season : above Ahwaz steamers of shallow draught (2-| ft.) can ascend to Shaleili on the A,b-i-Gargar, about 7 m. below Shushtar. The Ab-i- Diz had before the war been ascended with some difficulty in August by a steamer drawing 2f ft., to Umm el-Wawiyeh, within 20 m. by16 INTEODU CTION road from Dizful. The Karun is subject to floods in winter after rain, besides the great spring rises due to melting snow. Its rises are on the whole more violent and irregular than those of the Euphrates and Tigris, (See further, II A.) As regards land communications it is to be observed that Arabistan, like Irak, is partly dry alluvial desert, partly marsh. The dry desert beyond the neighbourhood of the rivers is very scantily supplied with water (what there is comes mainly from rain water wells and pools, which are nearly or quite exhausted in summer); and though the desert is good going in dry weather, after rain or flood its soft soil becomes very bad for movement. There is a certain amount of grazing on the desert in spring. On both sides of the Karun there are routes leading from Moham- mareh to Ahwaz. Both are indifferent; that on the r. bank appa rently is more diflficult than that on the 1. The Anglo-Persian Oil Co.'s pipe-line and telephone from Maidan-i-Naftun to 'Abbadan accom pany the track on the 1. (E.) side of the river (see 6 a, 6 b). N. of Ahwaz a route passable for wheeled traffic (at least in dry weather) led along the pipe-line near the E. bank of the river through Wais to Kut en-Naddaflyeh Keblr, where the pipe-line turns NE. away from the river. From this point wheeled traffic could apparently reach Band-i-Qir, where the Karun divides into the Ab-i-Shatait and the Ab-i-Gargar (bridged for wheels) and the Diz tributary comes in. Prom Band-i-Qir mule-tracks led to Shushtar across Miyanab Island between the Ab-i-Gargar on the E. and Ab-i-Shatait on the W. (see 6 c). Shushtar could also be reached by tracks passable (at least in dry weather) for wheeled transport running E. of the Ab-i-Gargar. Thus the road along the pipe-line could be followed from Kut en-Naddafiyeh to the point where it crosses the stream that flows into the Karun at Hasan Seyyid; from the crossing a track diverging N. ran to Shushtar close along the E. bank of the Ab-i-Gargar, or, again, the pipe-line road could be followed to Bard-i-Sarra Telephone Office, whence the Shushtar—Eamuz road might be followed into Shushtar. Several tracks which could probably be easily made passable for wheels run from Shushtar to Dizful (see 6 c). Dizful can apparently also be reached by desert tracks running direct NNW. from Ahwaz or Band-i-Qir. Water should be obtain able from the Karkeh, Khartir, or Diz rivers. Por one of these tracks from Band-i-Qir see Route 6 c, p. 219, and for a route which has been followed by motor lorries from Ahwaz nearly to Shush see Route 6 d.© I %ik INTRODUCTION 17 On the routes from Mohammareh and Ahwaz towards the Persian Gulf (to Fellahlyeh, Bandar Ma'shur, Hindlyan, and Bushire), see section on approaches from the Persian Gulf (p. 9). Other routes leading E. from the Karun are (1) that from Ahwaz to Ramuz and on to Behbehan and Shiraz (in its earlier stages a marshy, unhealthy route: see Routes in vol. iii, 65 and 61). (2) The Lynch road from Wais to Isfahan across the Bakhtiyari country (see Boutes in Persia, vol. iii, 69, and under heading BaMtiyari). (3) A cart-road branching from the pipe line road near Haddam and leading to the oil-wells at Neft-i-Safid. (4) The Shushtar—Ramuz road (passable for carts) running through Bard-i-Sarra and Neft-i-Safid, and crossing the Lynch road at Saniyeh (see Boutes in Persia, Corrections (1914), 72). (5) A mule-track from Shushtar running to join the Lynch road at Chashmeh Ranghani: this is connected with Maidan-i-Naftun by branch mule-tracks from Ab-i-Shikar and Gurgir (see Corrections to Yol. Ill (1914), 71). (6) Mule-track from Shushtar to Mamatain via Masambuli {Boutes in Persia, vol. iii, 77). The countryE. and NB. of the Tigris Pusht =i =Kuh. —(a) The region between theTigris below Amara and the Karun is marshy in its western part (Khor Hawlzeh), and mainly dry desert in its eastern portion. It is very sparsely inhabited, mainly by nomads and semi-nomads. The only route practicable for troops connecting the Tigris with the Karun seems to be that from Amara to Ahwaz, on which British and Turkish columns operated in the spring and early summer of 1915 (see I 8 a). A difficult track, but one practicable nearly throughout for all arms in the dry season, connects Dizful and Amara, fording the Karkeh 8 b). A track used by pack-animal caravans connects Amlnlyeh with Hawlzeh. From Hawlzeh a route over very waterless desert leads to Basra, a track runs to Kut el-Hawashim on the Karkeh, and other tracks go to Suwaib and Biseitin, whence channels practicable for canoes lead through the marshes to Amara and 'Ozeir, and also (in spring only) to Kurna and Nash web. There is boat traffic up the Karkeh from Biseitin to Kut Seyyid 'Ali. Near Biseitin baggage has to be*trans- ported by boat (see Boute 7). (h) The country between the Tigris above Amara and the hills of the low country is an open plain interspersed with marsh-areas, which are largely saline, and partly dry up in the dry season. In winter and spring (and especially early in the latter season) good pasturage is found in the plain-country below the hills, and this region is then to some extent occupied by the hill-tribes, who descend hither with their flocks and herds. At the beginning of summer the pasture MES. II18 INTRODUCTION withers, and the country between Dizful and Zorbatiyeh is almost wholly deserted. For routes from the Tigris above Amara towards the hills see Routes 8 c—g. Caravan tracks are said to lead to Shush and Dizful from Amara on the Tigris and Biseitin in the Khor Hawlzeh. From Dizful and Shush to Zorbatiyeh and Bedrah tracks passable for wheels run beneath the hills over open undulating country or plain ; but these, it appears, would be hardly practicable for troops except perhaps in winter and spring, when water and grazing are generally plentiful (though the water is often brackish), and live stock might be obtained from the mountain tribes which are then in the neighbourhood. (See Routes 10 a, b.) For a route across this desert following roughly the line of the Turco-Persian frontier, see Route 10 c. From Kut el-Amara a track passable for guns in dry weather goes N. to the small towns Jessan, Bedrah, and Zorbatiyeh: in winter and spring the salt-marshes N. of Kut would be serious obstacles. From Zorbatiyeh a difficult track, passable for mule—or donkey—transport only, leads across the hills to Kirmanshah. (See Route ^ and Routes in Persia, iii. 94.) Between Bedrah and Baghdad is open alluvial plain, very heavy going in wet weather. Luristan, 6tc. —The Pusht-i-Kuh and parallel ranges NE. of it to the upper valley of the Karkeh form a barrier to east-and-west com munication 4 practically from Dizful to Deh Bala. Parallel ranges 4,000 ft. and upwards in height rise between Dizful and the Isfahan plain. The easiest lines for road-construction between Dizful and Khurramabad make a detour westward. There is no track fit for wheels throughout (compare Routes 11 a-c). The best routes con necting Khurramabad, Burujird, and Kirmanshah, also, need more or less work to fit them for wheels (Routes 11 d-g). In this region water is generally plentiful; grazing also, with certain exceptions : supplies are scanty or wanting generally on the southern routes; in the north they can be had in the cultivated plains round Khurram abad, Burujird, Kangavar, and Kirmanshah. Passes are liable, for varying periods, to be blocked by snow. See introductions to Routes 11 a-g.RIYER ROUTES THE SHATT EL-'ARAB EOUTE I A FAO—BASRA (69| m.) Authorities: —Lorimer, Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, 1908 ; Persian Gulf Pilot, 1915 ; Admiralty Charts F 067 and 1235 ; and other sources of information. The Shatt el- Arab is the largest, or, if small native sailing- vessels be excluded from consideration, the only navigable river that enters the Persian Gulf. It carries the whole drainage of Turkish Irak and a large part of that of Persian Arabistan. The Shatt el-Arab is formed by the confluence at Kurna village of the Tigris and the Euphrates. The general direction of the river is SE., but in the reach between Basra and Mohammareh it has a more easterly and less southerly trend. Its mean breadth is about 600 yds. from Basra to the mouth of the Karun : below the latter point it at once broadens to ^ m,, and gradually reaches a width of 1 m. at Fao. Apart from the so-called ' New Channel' of the Euphrates there are only two considerable tributaries of the Shatt el-Arab, the Suweib (or Shwaiyib) and the Earnn, the latter being by far the more important. For the Suweib, which enters the Shatt el-Arab on its 1. bank 3 m. below Kurna, see IB, m. 44. The Karun, the only really navigable river in Persia, joins the Shatt el-Arab, also from the 1. bank, at a point about 22 m. by the course of the stream below Basra. (For the Karun see II A.) It may be noticed that the temperature of the Shatt el-Arab is sometimes as much as 16° F. higher than that of the Karun. The new channel of the Euphrates cuts the r. bank of the Shatt el-Arab at Gurmat Ali, about 8 m. above Basra. (See introduction to Route IV A.) The Fao Bar. —In most respects well suited to be a great com mercial waterway, the Shatt el-Arab has one disadvantage, and that a remediable one, in the undredged bar about 12 m. in breadth at its entrance, the banks of which are liable to change. From the sea ward side the first signs of approach to the mouth of the river are the discoloration of the sea-water by mud, and the lightship on the Khola shoal. After passing the lightship the channel is marked by a line of buoys, the positions of which are changed as need arises. (See the Persian Gulf Pilot, 1915.) When the river proper is entered the course is defined by landmarks and by the banks. Dredging is contemplated or has been undertaken ; subject to this, vessels of more than 11 ft. draught wait for the flood to cross the bar. b 220 RIVER ROUTES At high-water springs (the highest tide being always the night tide in winter and the day tide in summer) vessels of about 20 ft. draught can be navigated up to Basra. Vessels of such draught can only navigate with safety by crossing the bar on the top of high water of the highest tide of the 24 hours. At neaps the draught possible for this navigation is restricted to about 17 ft. The soundings on the bar are liable to be considerably reduced by a wind from the N., and the position of the channel is variable. Inward-bound vessels of more than 20 ft. draught are generally lightened (at the island of Jezlret Bubayan outside the river) to the requisite draught by steam lighters, and outward-bound vessels complete their loading there to more than that draught. Four steam lighters with a total carrying capacity of 4,000 tons are kept at Basra for the purpose of lightening or completing the loading of vessels outside the bar. The bar is of soft mud, and the B. I. mail steamers have been accustomed for many years to save time by ploughing through the mud when the water is less than their draught by one or even two feet. Navigation of the River. —Any vessel that can cross the bar can ascend to Basra without difficulty, the intermediate soundings being commonly 24 ft. or more. At the bends the deeper water is generally to be found on the concave side. The only part of the river awkwardly shallow is in the reach below Mohammareh, where there is a shifting bar caused by the deposit of silt from the Karun. This bar usually has 24 ft. of water over it at high tide, and is not a serious obstacle. (See further, m. 47| below.) The tides (which are stronger than the current of the river) affect the Shatt el-'Arab throughout its entire length, producing a rise of 6 to lOf feet at Basra. Sea-water, however, does not reach farther than about 20 m. above Fao. While a north wind reduces the depth of the water in the river, a south-west gale will produce abnormally high tides, giving an extra rise at Mohammareh of three feet and even more (see also under m. 4^). Islands in the Shatt el-'Arab usually lie so close to the banks that they can hardly be distinguished as such, and the fairway is nowhere divided or impeded by an island. The details of navigation are liable to be modified by changes due to the action of floods. The particulars regarding navigation given in the itinerary are taken from the Pers 1915, Detailed surveys of difficult stretches were contemplated in October, 1916. Banks. —The palm-tree is the most constant feature in the scenery of the Shatt el-'Arab. The date-palm plantations begin where the banks of the river cease to be covered at high tide, and continue the whole way to Basra. The date gardens on the r. bank lie in an almost unbroken belt ^ m. to 2 m. broad between the river and the desert,SHATT EL-'ARAB—ROUTE IA 21 which stretches to the Khor Zobeir, an arm of the sea nearly parallel to the course of the Shatt el-'Arab, and 25 to 30 m. distant from it {Eoute IC). Between the date plantations and the Khor Zobeir the country is partly marshy and partly desert. West of the Ichor is open desert, the going over which is reported to be firm and good. The northern part of the IcMr, about 20 m. S. of Basra, is surrounded by a marshy plain much intersected by creeks, north of which again an alluvial plain liable to inundation extends to Basra (but see p. 885). The 1. bank between the mouth of the river and the Hafifar Channel is constituted by the large island of 'Abbadan (m. 0), the centre of which is mostly uncultivated. Behind the cultivated fringe (-| to 2 m. deep) on the 1. bank between the Haflfar Channel and Basra stretches a flat, low-lying alluvial plain, usually called desert but fairly well watered. On the 1. bank the trees are younger, and open desert-stretches more frequent. In many places, particularly above Mohammareh, the natural banks of the river are below the highest flood levels, and there is an elaborate system of dykes known as sudd to prevent the flooding of the date gardens. Low tide usually exposes a strip of very muddy foreshore lying between the and the water, on which grow coarse rushes which are cut as food for cattle. This muddy foreshore makes landing very difficult and a pier of some kind almost a necessity. A feature of the river from its mouth upward are the numerous creeks which run from it towards the desert, where they end. These creeks (the more im portant of which are detailed in the itinerary) have generally the same name as the villages on them and the tracts through which they run. Constructed for irrigation, they are used as waterways by the Arabs in boats and canoes. There is usually a village on each creek half-way between the river and the desert, and a track with rough bridges over the creeks runs from village to village all the way from Fao to Basra. The 1. bank of the Shatt el-Arab is Persian territory as far as the Kheyyein Creek, about 1 m. above Fellahlyeh, 2f m. above the mouth of the Karun. The r. bank is Turkish, the boundary running along the edge of the Persian shore up to a point just below Mohammareh, where it passes to the middle ot the stream to include the Mohammareh anchorage within Persian territory. Inhabitants. —The r. bank is inhabited by river tribes, among whom are found Idan and Muutefiq in the lower reaches near Fao and above Mohammareh Idan and Muhaisin. In Fao district there are a number of Persian settlements. As regards the 1. bank, the southern part of Abbadan is inhabited chiefly by Nassar Arabs (Ea ab) and the northern part by Dris (Ka ab). Between the Karun and Mohiyeh there are mainly Muhaisin ; above Mohiyeh to Basra mainly Idan and c Atub.22 RIVER ROUTES Right Bank Has el-Bisheh, promontory forming westernmost point of the entrance to the Shatt el-'Arab, distant from the Khola Patch on the western side of the outer bar 11^ m.

By the Turks the name Fao is also applied to a whole Kaza in the Basra of which the administrative head-quarters are at Fao, which is the seat of a Kaimmakam. The station at Fao covers the riverward end of the spit between the Haji Abdallah and Haji Rashld creeks. Its frontage upon the river is about 600 yds. At high water landing is easy everywhere in the neighbourhood of Fao; but when the tide is low landing is hampered by the muddy foreshore.

The inhabitants are Ka'ab Arabs and number about 24,000. There are numerous villages and date-groves along the shores, but the centre of the island is desert. The only place of importance is the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's settlement and works (see m. 35). The island is in the province of Southern Arabistan and under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Mohammareh. Evidence regarding the extent of the tracts above Abbadan Island is very conflicting. Ma'amareh tract extends from the sea for some miles up the Shatt el-Arab to a point some distance above Fao.

At the back of this, about 700 yds. from river, date-groves extend for some hundreds of yards towards the desert. Fao, as the key of the Sliatt el-Arab and as the point where the Indo-European Telegraph Department meets the Turkish land line, is a place of international importance. As regards climate January and February are the wettest months, but there may be some rain in any month. Total rainfall for Dec., Jan., Feb., 1904-5 was 3-65 in., in l905-6 1 '68. In summer the temperature may rise over 120° F. In winter it may fall to about 50°. During July and first half of March NW. winds ordinarily prevail with dry heat and from the middle of July to end of September the atmosphere is damp as well as hot; in September and October there are frequently fogs at night and in the early morning.

The holding ground at the junction of the rivers is not good, and a ship anchored there continually yaws from the effect of the two streams: moreover, whirlpools are formed here in the flood-season. There is said to be a good berth in the Haifar Channel just above the Consulate and E. of a permanent hulk, but it is not recommended for a short stay as it is difficult to get out of the channel unless the ship is swung to the flood tide. Vessels using the inner anchorage usually lie off the town close to the bank, but there is no room for large ships to swing, and for this reason the outer anchorage is preferred except for small steamers up to 600 tons. It appears to be high water at Mohammareh about 6 hours after high water on the outer bar at Fao. The rise of the tide at Mohammareh is 6 -9 ft. In 1915 it was reported that 3 or 4 iron lighters (60 tons), about 27 wooden barges (100 men or 40 tons), an uncertain number of baghalahs (100 men or 40 tons), and a large supply of passenger were locally available. No details as to numbers, &amp;c., of craft at present available. The Sheikh of Mohammareh owns a steam yacht, two steam launches, and a tug. Besides steamers em ployed for military purposes, S.S. Nasrat (80 tons), owned by the Nasiri Co., still runs from Mohammareh to Nazirl. Landing-places can be found anywhere on either side of the Haffar Channel, on the Shatt el-'Arab, and on the Bahman Shir River from barges or launches. The 1. banks of the Shatt el-'Arab and of the Haffar Channel are fairly steep in this neighbourhood. The banks are everywhere mud, their height being some 12 to 15 ft. A supply of 30-ft. planks is necessary. A landing on the banks is muddy work, but is not difficult except for animals. It should not be attempted during strong ebb-tides.

(see Persian 1915, pp. 156 and 280). The width of the channel varies from 1 to 4 m. between the 3-fathom contours. Depths of 4 fathoms can be carried to about 5 m. SE. of Warbeh Island (3 } z m. from the Warbeh sand bank). Thence depths of 3| fathoms are to be found up to the channels on either side of Warbeh. The northern of these channels has apparently depths varying from 7 to 2± fathoms, the least depth being at the western end. The southern has depths of 2-10 fathoms, but its navigation is not recommended. There are said to be good anchorages in the northern channel. Both sides of the Khor 'Abdallah consist of low alluvial land covered with reeds and grass. Shallow flats extend a long way from both sides, but much farther from the northern shore, where the land is marshy and liable to inundation. Boat channels are believed to connect the Khor Abdallah with the Shatt el- Arab between Basra and Mohammareh at Hamdan or Abu'l Eulus. The Khor es-Sabiyeh is an inlet of the sea running NNW. from the northern corner of Koweit Bay between the mainland on the W, and Bubayan Island on the E. A small prolongation of the Khor passing W. of Warbeh I. joins the Khor eth-Tha'alab leading# KHOR 'ABDALLAH, &amp;c.—ROUTES ^1C, IIA 61 to the Khor Zobeir : while another channel passing S. of Warbeh connects with the Kh5r Ahdallah (see above). The Khor es-Sabiyeh has depths of 1-5 fathoms. The southern approach over Dhorub Flat is very shallow. The Mor is about ^—1 m. wide. Its banks are swampy, but there are a good many boulders, especially on its E. side. The desert route from Umm Qasr to Koweit 23 d) runs along its W. shore. Landing at Qasr es-Sabiyeh at the corner of Koweit Bay is difficult at all tides on account of mud. The Khor eth-Tha'alab runs for about 6 m. W. and N. from Warbeh Island with soundings of 6-9 fathoms. At 6 m. it divides, one branch (the Khor Umm Qasr) running W. past Umm Qasr (see Routes 23 a, b, d) with only 3-4 ft. of water at low tide, and the other (the Khor Zobeir) running N. Vessels of 25 ft. draught and 450 ft. length can navigate the Khor Zobeir up to this point, but the channel is winding and navigation is not easy. The best landing- place is about 3 m. S. of Umm Qasr and about 1 m. N. of a sharp E. bend of the Mor. Here the slope of the bank is - jq , and at high tide light-draught native craft or barges can come close to the shore, which is firm from here to the higher ground 1 m. W., along which the track runs. Farther N. the ground between shore and track is soft. Above the Khor Umm Qasr the Khor Zobeir continues N. for some 14 m. to Junction Island, being navigable thus far by vessels of 20 ft. draught and 300 ft. length. Here the Mor divides, and the main branch is navigable 5 m. farther, to Dwerat Island, for launches of 6 ft. draught and 60 ft. length. KOUTE IIA THE NAVIGATION OF THE KARUN Authorities : —Lorimer, Oasetteer of the Persia 1908 ; 1911; Persian Gulf Pilot, 1915 ; Readings of the Kama River Gauge at Ahwaz (below the Rapids) ; and other information. High and Low Water Seasons. —The Karun is liable to more violent and irregular changes of level than the Mesopotamian rivers. It is generally low water from August till towards the end of November, though in the abnormal year 1914 there was a marked rise at the end of October. In December-January there are usually considerable rises, which, however, vary greatly in extent from year to year. Towards the end of January or beginning of February the river usually sinks, to rise again with the spring floods which begin at the end of February or beginning of March. Very violent and■ 62 RIVER ROUTES sudden rises may occur at the end of February, or (more commonly) in March or April. In the second half of April there is the greatest mean volume of water in the river, which sinks steadily through May and continues to decline through June and July. The difference between high and low water may be taken to be on the whole 12-14 ft,, but there is a difference of between the highest and lowest records. The details of navigation are subject to much alteration owing to the changes produced on the bed of the river by the floods. Mohammaeeh—Bandar Naziei (about 110 m.) Up to Bandar Naziri the Karun is in most parts, and in ordinary seasons, navigable by a vessel of 5 or even 6 ft. draught: but in the 20 m. below Kaziri, a vessel of 3^- ft. draught may find difficulty when the river is low. Vessels of 12 ft. draught can reach Salmaneli bend, 14 m. above Mohammareh. The rate of the stream in a high river is 4-6 knots, in a low river about 2 knots. The river is 2-5 cables wide, and the channel is tortuous (especially above 'Ali ibn el-Husein, 31 m. from Moham mareh), and very narrow at the bends, where the deepest water is generally on the concave side. Sand-banks extend from most of the points, sometimes half-way across the river. The tide is felt as far as Ali ibn el-Husein. As far as Kut Abdallah, 5-6 m. below Naziri, the bottom is mostly sand, or sand and mud, and is generally free from rocks ; though 2 m. below Farisiat village a rock covered at high river projects about 30 ft. from the r. bank. Off Kut 'Abdallah are rocks with about 3 ft. of water. From this village to Bandar Naziri the river is much encumbered with sand-banks and subject to constantly changing channels. The banks from Mohammareh to Bandar Naziri are low, and the adjoining country consists of uncultivated plains deserted in summer and occupied by Arab encampments in winter. From Bandar Nazirx to Ahwaz (little more than 1 m.) there is a great rise in the river-bed, and a series of heavy rapids, generally considered unnavigable, exists. These rapids are 5 in number, with a total length of about 2,000 yds. The real obstacle to navigation is the second rapid from the top, where a reef runs out from the 1. bank leaving a channel only 100 yds. broad, broken up by islets into two or three passages, of which the one nearest to the r. bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yds. The water here rushes with a fall of 1 in 50. The total loss of height between »LTHE KARON—ROUTE II A 68 the top and the bottom of the rapids is 1 ft. in high water, and 7-8 ft. in a low river. The rapids are said to be passable by towing, and it is stated that steamers have twice successfully ascended them under steam. Usually cargoes are landed at a small natural basin off Bandar Nazirl, and conveyed by tram to vessels above the rapids. It is reported that a canal on the 1. bank, some 2,350 yds. long, with a cutting 35 ft. deep, would be required to avoid the rapids. The formation here is sandstone. A possible alternative to this would be, it is said, the reopening of an ancient (probably irrigation) canal which runs E. of Ahwaz ; its length is about 2| m. For the description of Ahwaz—Nazirl see Gazetteer of Towns. Ahwaz—Shaleili (about 80 m.). The Karun above Ahwaz is navigable by shallow-draught steamers up to Shaleili (on the Ab-i-Gargar Channel 1\ m. belpw Shushtar). The river between Ahwaz and Band-i -Qir is tortuous, 1-3 cables wide, flowing between banks 10-30 ft. high. The bottom from Ahwaz to Qaraneh Reach is rocky : above Qaraneh Reach it is sand, or sand and mud. At Band-i-Qir the Ab-i-Diz tributary comes in on the r. bank (see below) and the Karun divides into two channels, the western being called the Ab -i-Shatait, the eastern the Ab-i-Gargar. The Ata-i-Shatait is blocked about 1 m. above Band-i-Qir by a ridge of rocks which makes it impassable for steamers and nearly so for native boats. The Ab-i-Gargar is bridged at Band-i-Qir by 8 pontoons: this bridge is constructed in two halves, either of which can be removed for the passage of vessels. The stream near Band-i-Qir is 40-100 yds. wide, with depths of 3-6 ft. Under the telegraph wires which cross the river a few miles above Band-i-Qir there is a rocky ridge having a very narrow passage barely prac ticable for steamers. Between Hasan Seyyid and Banlatabad the channel is full of dangerous snags very firmly rooted. Khalat peak, a triangular-shaped summit of the nearest hills to the E., is an excellent mark. The banks of the river in this region are 30-40 ft. high. Steamers stop at Shaleili landing-place on the r. bank opposite an island. It is reported that a little blasting would enable steamers to go higher. The Ab-i-Diz Tributary The Ab-i-Dlz has been ascended in August by S.S. a stern-wheeler (80 ft. long, 30 ft. beam, and 2-| ft. draught), as# 64 RIVER ROUTES far as Umm el-Wawiyeh, 20 m. by road from Dizful. It is reported that in spring and winter the river is navigable as far as Kut 'Abdush Shah. The Shushan entered the Ab-i-Dlz by a channel 20 yds. wide and proceeded for hrs. through a winding channel with 3 ft. of water. The channel then deepened to an average of 9 ft, except where, about every 5 miles, it was barred by long sand-banks covered by 3 ft. of water. On the third day the Shushan reached Kut Bandar. Here a reef of rocks extends across the river, through which is a straight channel 4 ft. deep. Then passing through intricate channels the vessel arrived at Umm el- Wawiyeh, about 10 m. beyond Kut Bandar. It was found impossible to proceed farther. On the return journey much difficulty was experienced through grounding and striking in the bends. The ascent occupied 51 hrs., the descent 36 hrs. The country on the Ab-i-Dlz is in places very well wooded, and the steamers on the Karun before the war drew thence their supply of wood fuel. ROUTE IIB THE NAVIGATION OF THE BAHMAN SHIR Authorities: —Lorimer, Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, 1908; Persian Gulf Pilot, 1915. This is a mouth of the Karun River, which enters the Persian Gulf about 10 m. E, of the Shatt el- c Aralb and takes off from the main stream about 2 m. above Mohammareh. Its total length is about 54 m. (40 in a straight line). Vessels of 7-ft. draught can enter the Bahman Shir from the Persian Gulf at low water, the least depth being fathoms on a bar of soft mud 10 m. from the mouth. Inside the bar depths vary from IJ to 2 fathoms. The river is navigable for about 30 m. up-stream by vessels drawing 7 ft., but in the uppermost 14-15 m. it is very shallow, the channel being obstructed by mud-flats, and in 1890 E. I. M. S. Comet (3-ft. draught) grounded twice in these reaches. Since then the conditions of navigation have pro bably become worse. Native sea-going boats cannot pass the shoals of the Upper Bahman Shir without assistance from the tide, the rise and fall of which make a difference of about 9 ft. Near its mouth the stream flows through a region of shelving mud-flats covered above the water-line with coarse grass and reeds. The banks then become firm and steep, and grassy plains extend on either side of the river. About 20 m. from the sea begin the dateTHE BAHMAN SHlE—EOUTE IIB 65 plantations and villages which line the banks on the rest of the Bahman Shir's course. Islands are easily formed in the channel by staking the stream and so causing a deposit of silt to be formed. This is frequently done, the new islands being used first for pasturage, and subsequently for cultivation. The inhabitants of the villages on the banks are Arabs of the Ka'ab and Muhaisin tribes. The natives apparently do not use the term Bahman Shir for the whole river, but have various names, taken from the villages on the banks, for the different parts of the stream. They perhaps use the term Shatt Suleik to refer to the whole stream: this must not be confused with the Khor Silak, the name of a stream in Dauraqistan which enters the Gulf between the Bahman Shir and the Khor Musa. THE TIGRIS ROUTE III A KUKNA—AMAEA (92i M.) Authorities Lorimer, Gazetteer of the Persian 1908; Force ' DMap Serials 35, 36 (.Tuly 1915) ; and other sources of information. The navigation of this section is easy for shallow-draught steamers as far as 'Ozeir (Ezra 's Tomb), up to which point there is a depth of not less than 12 ft. The river then begins to shallow and narrow, a large volume of water having been taken off by canals between Amara and Qal'at Salih, especially by the Michrlyeh (m. 59^). The stream is bordered by marsh covered with high reeds. 3 or 4 m. below Qalat Salih the banks become more defined and the water in the channel deeper, and above that place the improvement con tinues to Amara. At no season in the year is navigation by river steamers impossible in this section between 'Ozeir and Amara, but when the river is at its lowest navigation in the shallower reaches becomes more troublesome and tedious, though never dangerous. There are some sharp elbow-bends between 'Ozeir and Qal'at Salih, and on the convex shore at the river bends there are usually shoals. Details of the navigation are continually changing. Those in the following account are from charts of July and August 1915. In the narrows between Ezra's Tomb and Qal'at Salih, Arab MES. II JS66 RIVER ROUTES cultivators have been causing considerable deterioration in the channel, both by throwing out brushwood groynes and reclaiming the land on a falling flood, and by cutting irrigation channels at the concave sides of bends. It is reported that if these practices were checked and the narrows dredged, navigation would be materially assisted here. 2 m. above Kurna town the palm-trees cease, and between that point and Amara occur only in isolated clumps. Marshes prevail on both banks of the river to a point some 10 m. above c Ozeir, though in places there are small areas of cultivation ; above this point there are fine areas of grazing ground and cultivation and numerous Arab settlements of mat huts, sometimes collected round a large mud building, half dwelling-house, half fort.

The principal occupation of the A1 Bu Mohammed is the breeding of buffaloes and cattle, of which they possess enormous herds. Their principal crops are rice, maize, and mash. This section of the river passes through the of Kurna, Shatret el-Amareh (Qalat Salih or Jillah), and Amara, all of which belong to the Vilayet of Basra.

Landing and Anchorage. —A good embankment or wharf faced with brick runs the whole length of the town, more than m., and steamers can tie up to this at the upper end of the town; lower down they must anchor some yards out in the stream as the bank is not steep to. The width of the river is about 195 yds., with depths from 13|r ft. (high water) to 6^ ft. (low water). navigable for river steamers of from 3 to 6 ft. draught, according to the season. There are shifting banks in the river, especially, it seems, between Ali el-Gharbi and Sheikh Sa'ad, where the river widens considerably. Here arrangements have been made for keeping the best channel marked and buoyed. Banks. —It was said in 1908 that between Amara and 'Ali esh- Sharqi (m. 43) there is always 8 ft. of water even in a low river. Between 'Ali esh-Sharqi and Kut there are three or four bad reaches. In this section the height of the banks rises steadily from 4 ft. to 16^ ft. at Kut. Up to 'Ali el-Gharbi the water of ordinary floods freely overflows. Creeks and canals are numerous. Above the Mnsharreh and Jehaleh. canals (see Gazetteer of Towns, Amara) the principal outlets on the r. bank are the Biteireh, Sofeir, Dnjeileh, and Snfeiliat, all below 'Atah, m, 52, and the Orah or80 RIVER ROUTES Ttuuman about *40 m. below Kut. The largest of these canals have a breadth of 40 to 55 yds. ; they contain little water in 1. w., but may become considerable rivers in h.w. (For the bar at the mouth of the Jehaleh see m. 0, below.) Unsuccessful attempts were made before the war to control the heads of the canals, and they occasionally drown out the crops which they have fertilized. On the 1. bank between Fileifileh and 'Orah numerous streams bring saline water from the Persian hills. They are swollen by rain or melting snow and dry at other times. Near the banks on both sides marshes alternate with cultivable areas in which wheat, barley, and rice are sown, the yield varying with the amount of rainfall and flood. The areas under cultivation are protected by low dykes which are occasionally breached. Beyond the immediate neighbourhood of Amara trees are scarce, but increasing in number. Sheep abound everywhere. Ruins and mounds marking sites of former settlements are common. For the routes along the Tigris banks to 'Ali el-Gharbi see Routes 5 a, b. The T.L. follows the r. bank till a point *6 m. below Kut, where it crosses to 1. bank. Beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the bank on both sides are large patches of swamp, often salt, the size of which varies according to the season. The great marshy area N. and NE. of Kut, which comes down close to the river bank, is specially noticeable. Running S. from the Tigris at Kut to the Euphrates is the Shatt el-Hai (see Routes V and 19 a, b). As Ali el-Gharbi is approached the course of the river runs closer to the Pusht -i-Kiih range. At Ali el-Gharbi the foot-hills are only t 14 m. distant NE. From that point onwards the river gradually recedes from the mountains, which in the neighbourhood of Kut are some 50 m. away. From the hills flow numerous brackish streams, which, however, dry up except after rain, when some of them reach the Tigris. Beyond the neighbourhood of the river the country is desert as far as the mountains, except for the oases of Jessan, Bedrah, and Zorbatiyeh, N. of Kut.

From this point they are succeeded by the Beni E-abi ah tribe, of which a section known as the Maqasis extends along both banks, being intermingled on the 1. bank with the Kawam subsection of the same tribe. The Beni Lam are the largest and most powerful tribe in Irak next to the Muntefiq. Their number is estimated at 45,000, of which 15,000 are said to be fighting-men, who are well supplied with modern rifles and are good shots. The proportion of mounted and unmounted men is said to be about equal. Their main habitat is the plain between the Tigris and the Pusht-i-Kuh, but sections of the tribe are found to N. and W. in the districts of Bedrah and Mandali, and E. and SE. in Persian Arabistan around the Karkeh River and Hawlzeh. To the NE. they are in contact with the Faili Lnrs, with whom they have frequent feuds. They are a pastoral people mainly engaged in agriculture, but retain nomad habits to the extent that they have no houses, but live in hair-tents and migrate to the hills in cold weather. Their camels and horses are said to be the best in Irak; they also own buffaloes, cattle, sheep, and donkeys. They are almost all Shiahs; some speak Persian as well as Arabic. They have great respect for their own sheikhs. They have a reputation for predatory habits, but in fact the majority of the tribe lead a peaceful life. The Beni Rabl'ah are a strong and prosperous tribe, but not so numerous as the Beni Lam. No estimate of their numbers can be given, but it is said that about a quarter of their fighting strength is well mounted. They are engaged in agri culture, and are rich in sheep, cattle, horses, and camels. All except the Kawam section are Shiahs. The Maqasl section are respected as Seyyids and wear their hair long. This section and one called Einaneh are addicted to brigandage.

From Kut el-Amara to Baghdad is a distance T 100 m. NW., about 204 m. by river and 112 m. by road. The general direction of the rivei is first NW. to a point a few miles below Cti6siplion and then NNW., but its windings are frequent, the bends sharp, and the reaches long, so that it forms large loops, sometimes narrow, some times broad. The width of the river is on an average between 330 and 440 yds.; the depth (l.w.) about 5 ft., considerably less than the depth in the former section: the velocity is about 1 to 1| m. (l.w.).

Navigation. —The river is navigable for river steamers, but the bends and shifting sandbanks make navigation troublesome, and there are several difficult reaches, especially between Azlziyeh and Diyaleh, which are noted in the itinerary : in these reaches at l.w. the depth of the river may decrease to 3 ft. Up-stream navigation otherwise than by steamer is slow with a head-wind : it takes roughly 10 hrs. to make 16-18 m. There are numerous minor creeks and canals from both banks : the most important is the Kharr, a few miles below Baghdad on the r. bank. In this section the Tigris re ceives one of its three most important tributaries, the Diyaleh. River. Banks.— Along the banks stretches of cultivated land are met with here and there, but the greater part is under shrubs and grasses. Up to a point some 20 m. below Ctesiphon, overflows of the Tigris, which are not retained by dykes, do considerable damage and are never drained off, and the evaporated waters leave their salt behind. Wild liquorice grows everywhere and is of commercial value. Between Ctesiphon and Baghdad in winter, wheat and green barley are94 RIVER ROUTES grown : irrigation for these crops is effected by In summer millet, sesame, &amp;c., are raised on the land irrigated by canals. Date plantations become a normal feature again a few miles below Baghdad. Sheep and goats are numerous everywhere. Throughout this section the land route and T.L. from Kut el- Amara to Baghdad follow the general line of the 1. bank, but by cutting the bends diminish the distance to nearly a half of the distance by river. Beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the river the country on the 1, bank is still a flat plain leading up towards the Persian hills, from which a number of streams flow. Most of their water drains into a great belt of swampy ground, flooded in spring, which extends from the neighbourhood of Mandali about T o0 m. S., and then turns SE., joining the Khor Suweiklyeh about T 15 m. N. of Kut el- Amara. Nearer to the Tigris are two or three considerable patches of marsh, near Bogheileh and Azlziyeh, This country is hardly cultivated at all, and evaporation tends to leave the land salt. For the country between this section of the Tigris and the Euphrates see pp. 14, 15, 149, 150, 20 a, b, 21 a and App. B. Canals.—-The dry courses of ancient canals are noticeable features in the plains on both sides of the river. The most important of these canals are broad troughs, the bottom of which may be 50- 60 yds. wide, and is usually above the level of the surrounding country, with banks which may be 30-40 ft. high. Prom the courses of the main canals numerous branches diverge. Inhabitants. —The principal tribes in this section are the Beni Babiah, the Zobeid, and the Shammar Toqah. The Beni Rabiah (for particulars see Introduction to III B) are found on both banks of the river up to Bogheileh, and their territory runs inland to a depth of 20 to 25 m. on either side. They appear sporadically in other places, as for instance at Mahmudiyeh. Right Bank Kut el-Amara. Above Kut el-Amara the river runs NW.

Their most important sections, which are sometimes regarded as inde pendent tribes, are the Ea'aij ,the Da war, the Battar, the K.asraj , and the Jebur, divided into the subsections AlBuKhattab and El-Wawi. They are all Shiahs except two sections, the 'Agil and the 'Azzeh, who are Sunnis and live in the Kazimain district. The Zobeid are cultivators, and grow wheat, barley, rice, and maize, and breed horses, camels, cattle, and sheep, but no buffaloes. They live chiefly in black tents. Their chief in 1908 was Rashid Beg, living 10 to 12 m.W. of Su weir eh. They are at feud with the Northern Shammar on the 1. bank of the river, and are closely allied with the Dilaim, who live principally in the country between Baghdad and Hit, but are sometimes found in the Kazimain district. The Shammar Toqah occupy the 1. bank of the Tigris from Bogheileh to Baghdad, their territory extending for about 25 m. towards the Persian hills and including part of the Diyaleh Plain. They are a branch of the Northern Shammar : they were originally Sunnis, but are now entirely Shiahs. Like the Zobeid tribe, the Shammar count among their sections a Dawar and a Battar. Two other sections, the Qnfeifan below Khanaseh and the Manasir below Ctesiphon, are also sometimes reckoned as Zobeid, while the Dafafir, usually regarded as an independent tribe, are sometimes counted as Shammar. The 'Atbah and Salmat sections are found in the Kut Kaza. The Shammar grow wheat, barley, maize, and sesame, and breed cattle and camels. They live mainly in tents and sometimes wander in spring. In 1908 they were not strong in horses. The recognized chief of the whole tribe was then Seyyid Sufukh.

History. —The two Greek cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon go back to the time of the Macedonian successors of Alexander. Seleucia was founded by Alexander's marshal Seleucus, who took the title of king in 306 b. c . and ruled over Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Eastern Asia Minor. Ctesiphon was founded by his successors and was for some time subordinate to Seleucia. The Greek Seleucidae were succeeded towards the end of the second century b. c . by the Parthian Arsacidae, who established the Parthian Empire in Mesopotamia. Ctesiphon, which had now become the more important town, was the winter residence of the kings: Seleucia, however, remained for long a centre of Greek culture. In the second century a . ». the towns were captured by the Roman Emperor Trajan, who punished the inhabitants of Seleucia for a rising after the town had surrendered by reducing it to ashes. In the middle of the third century a. d . the Arsacidae were replaced by another Persian dynasty, the Sassanids, who enlarged Ctesiphon and adorned it with great buildings. Around the ruins of Seleucia corn is grown, but i m. W.THE TIGRIS—ROUTE III C 107 Inter mediate distance Miles 1 2 Bustan, in the tract of that name.

The hall is 148 ft. long, 76 ft. broad, and 85 ft. high; the N. and S. walls are practically complete. The hall had a great vaulted roof (built without the use of centring beams), of which the middle part remains. A large portion of the western wall is also standing : the walls are said to be 23 ft. thick. The total length of the facade was 270 ft., but only the S. wing is now standing : it is 86 ft. high and 23 ft. thick. The E. end apparently lay open to the rising sun or was sheltered by a great curtain, of which the Arabs who sacked the city seem to have discovered part. The front of the facade (E.) has one open arched door, flanked by blind arches; above this four rows of shallow niches like blind windows with engaged columns.

The Old and New Channels. —The country through which the Euphrates runs from Nasirlyeh to its junction with the Tigris is the southern part of the great marshes of Lower Irak, which occupy roughly the triangle between Basra, Nasirlyeh, and Amara. The main channel in 1915 was that which runs (as followed up-stream) from Kurna to Chubeish, thence across the N. part of the Hammar Lake, and so by the Haqiqeh. Cut to a point about 2 m. above Suq, esh-Shuyukh. This is the so-called Old Channel, which in 1915 was reported practicable for river steamers of 5-ft. draught in the months January-July. The water in the Hammar and the bars at Chubeish and in the Haqiqeh Channel has fallen to 1—2 ft. These shallows are being dredged : see Appendix C (pp. 470-472). In recent years the waters of the Euphrates have been forming a new channel which lies to the S. of the old, and runs (as followed up-stream) from Gurmat Ali on the Shatt el-'Arab to the neighbourhood of Harir, where it enters a great area of open water and reed-grown marsh. Across this waste of waters, which is of great extent during the spring floods, the channel is very indefinite. In 1915 it was appa rently necessary for steamers following the New Channel to enter the Hammar Lake and ascend the Haqiqeh Cut in order to reach Suq esh-Shuyukh, as the mouth of the Mezlaq Channel to the S. of the Haqiqeh was closed by a bar to vessels larger than ordinary or large bcllams. (See section ii of this route.) In the flood season there is a perceptible current from N. to S. across the Euphrates water in the Hammar Lake. Probably the Euphrates above Haqiqeh finds its way into the Hammar Lake by the Haqiqeh and other channels, and the Hammar water then to a large extent drains into the Shatt el-'Arab at Gurmat 'Ali. The Haqiqeh Channel has now been closed to navigation (1917).THE EUPHRATES—ROUTE IV A 115 and the Mezlaq channel opened. See further Appendix C, pp. 469- 470. It is impossible to give the course of the channels with certainty where they pass through lakes and swamps. From Suq esh-Shuyukh, though the swamps are close at hand on the N. and the desert on the S., the river runs in a firm bed through a belt of date plantations for 20 m. in a general NNW. direction to Nasirlyeh. The Banks. —When the channel of the river is running through lake or swamp it is manifest that it has no immediate banks, though in the low-water season patches of submerged ground appear as marshy islands and promontories: some of these patches, indeed, notably those between the Hammar and the S. water-belt, are permanently dry, and contain hamlets, rice-fields, and date plantations. Yet even in these settlements whole families have been found during the high-water season living in canoes floating inside the huts, and in most years the floor of the hut has to be raised during the floods by bundles of reeds to keep the occupants out of the water. Wherever the bed of the river is firmer, the banks on either side are cultivated, date-groves are planted, and villages and hamlets are frequent. It will thus be seen that the New Channel has no banks except for a short stretch at its lower end, while the Old Channel is cultivated and populated from Kurna to Chubeish, and the section of the main river from Suq esh- Shuyukh to Nasirlyeh has a belt of almost continuous date-groves on either bank, with villages and settlements following one another in quick succession. Beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the river the country on the N. is throughout the whole route a swampy waste traversed by the great canals of the Majarr es-Saghir and Majarr el-Kebir running SW. into the Hammar Lake from the Tigris, and the ITahr Beidha or Bed'ah and the Nahr Hamzeli running SE. from the Shatt el-Hai. To the S. the swamp stretches away to the line Gurmat Ali—Khamslyeh, and at its SE, corner the floods spread in spring to the plain between Basra and Zobeir. In the stretch from Suq esh-Shuyukh to Nasirlyeh the desert lies behind the date plantations with occasional swampy areas. The country between the Old and New Channels—an obtuse-angled triangle with its base formed by the Shatt el-Arab—is entirely swampy, and is traversed by the Nahr 'Antar, the Nahr Salih, and numerous other creeks running from the Old to the New Channel. For the route from Basra to Nasiriyeh. and Nejef, which runs across the desert to the S, of the swamp-area, see 13 a. The telegraph (Kurna—Hilla line) runs along the N. edge of the Old Channel, first WSW. direct from Kurna to Chubeish, then making h 2116 EIVEE KOUTES a detour to N. round the border of the Hammar Lake, and rejoining the river at the upper end of the Haqiqeh Channel. Thence it follows the 1. bank to Nasirlyeh. Inhabitants. —In the marsh country and in the dry desert to the S. the Muntefiq tribe is still by far the most important; but in recent years its influence seems to have suffered a considerable decline, partly, perhaps, owing to Turkish policy. The Muntefiq properly so called are still the core of a loose confederacy of clans (held together by ties of blood or political association) to which the name Muntefiq in a wider and vaguer sense is given. But at the present time not only have the Muntefiq been separated from their former section the Beni Malik (on the lower Tigris), and almost entirely displaced from those parts of the Shatt el- e Arab below Basra which they used to occupy, but in the area now under consideration their once sub ordinate allies, and possibly kinsmen, the Beni Mansur and Ahl el- Jazair, who live intermingled along the Euphrates above Kurna as far as the Hammar Lake, are now entirely independent. These Beni Mansur and Ahl el-Jazair are Shiahs by religion. That they are now scattered over the Kaza of Kurna and over a large part of the Kaza of Suq esh-Shuyukh is the result of a Turkish punitive expedition, which was provoked about fifteen years ago by the murder of some Ottoman officials. The main portion of the Beni Mansur live on the S. side of the Old Channel of the Euphrates from about 1 m. above Kurna to the Nahr c Antar (m. 11|). Other tribal groups in this neighbourhood are the Beni'Asad, who live interspersed among the Beni Mansur and Ah] el-Jazair (as at Chubeish) and inhabit some of the marsh villages S. of the Hammar Lake, and the Duaiyish, who are to be found along its NE. shores. The authority of the Arab sheikhs from Kurna to Chubeish is distributed as follows :— The Sheikh of Kurna claims control over Kurna, Muzeira'ah, opposite Kurna on the 1. bank of the Tigris, over the villages above Kurna on the Tigris (r. bank) for about 3 m., over all the settlements on the N. bank of the Euphrates from Kurna to El-Howeir Creek, and on the S. bank from the boundary of Sherish opposite Norfolk Creek to a creek on the border of Medineh. The Sheikh of Sherish used to be subject to Kurna, but is now independent, and controls the Sherish tract between the Beni Mansur lands on the W. and Deir on the r. bank of the Shatt el- e Arab to the S. Under Medineh. are the country on the S. bank from Nahr c Antar to Nahr Salih, and the N. bank of the Euphrates from El Howeir Creek towards Chubeish, including El-Khas and Turabeh.THE EUPHRATES—EOUTE IV A 117 The Sheikh of Chubeish controls the country from the W. border of Medineh to the Hammar Lake. To W. and NW. of the Hammar Lake live the Beui Keigan, who command the lower end of the Haqiqeh Channel. With regard to the political organization of the Arabs on Hammar Lake and up to Suq esh-Shuyukh, it may be said that every Arab who owns or can build a tower pretends to the dignity of independence. The balance of power is constantly changing as strong characters arise and disappear. The Muntefiq. proper have their head-quarters in the country round Suq esh-Shuyukh and Nasirlyeh, and extend for some distance W. and N. of the latter place. The Bedouin of the desert in this region are mostly Muntefiq, and even the settled members of the tribe frequent the desert pastures in spring with their numerous camels and other live stock. The powerful Dhafir tribe, whose head-quarters are in the desert SW. of the Muntefiq, occasionally appear in the neighbourhood of Nasirlyeh town. The inhabitants of the swamps outside the patches of cultivation are Ma'adan. They and their families and live stock lead an am phibious existence, their water-buffaloes feeding and swimming apparently for days in the deeper marshes, and the other cattle feeding in the shallower parts on grasses which grow under water. The Ma'adan huts are frequently built on floating bundles of reeds, but patches of dry ground exist, and on them the cattle are milked, and clusters of huts are built. The huts are called and are constructed of reeds and reed mats. They can be erected in a day, and can easily be removed to another site, the material being trans ported in canoes. The Ma'adan take small interest in anything out side their own affairs, and give little trouble. They are looked down upon by the agricultural tribes. They have no sheikhs of their own, and attach themselves to the sheikh of the nearest Arab tribe, and pay him a tribute in kind for protection.

It is therefore difficult to estimate the size or to define the boundaries of the lake, but it may be said roughly that it is about 6 m. broad from N. to S., and 12 m. long from E. to W. On its northern and southern sides are belts of island-villages. Northward from the northern islands is a shallow inundation area, southward of the southern are marsh and thick reed-beds dividing the Hammar Lake from the open water of the New Channel. On the N. the Hammar Lake is fed by the two great canals known as the Majarr el-Kebir and Majarr es-Saghir, which run from the r. bank of the Tigris between Qal'at Salih and Amara. On the NW. it is entered by the Nahr el-Beidha and the Ualu? Hamzeh., which run from the Shatt el-Hai, the former from a point a few miles N. of Shatreh, the latter from about half-way between Shatreh and Nasirlyeh. For the navigation of the Beidha and Hamzeh see J\out6\,The Old Channel of the Euphrates enters the Hammar Lake on the W., and crosses it in a broad curve to N., leaving it at a point SE. of Beni Huteit. The Hammar Lake is fed by the Old Channel of the Euphrates (called Haqiqeh), by the canals above mentioned, and by other channels on the W. and N., and is drained partly by the old bed of the river already described, and partly also by the channels running SW. and SSW. to the open water through which the new main channel of the Euphrates runs to Grurmat 'All. In October 1916 it was intended to survey the Hammar Channel. See further Appendix C. All the villages to S. of the lake are marked by palm- groves, and appear as islands in the midst of swamp or open water. Their names, order, and relative positions are very differently given in various recent maps. Many kinds of wild-fowl abound in the lake, including coot, mallard, widgeon, and pochard. In the spring of 1915 the following was given as the description of the course of the channel through the lake. The general direction of the channel was first NW. and then and ^VSW. From the point where the river first broadens into the lake the channel was at first some 200 yds. wide, and was marked on either side by reeds, those Total distance MilesTHE EUPHRATES-ROUTE IV A (i) Inter mediate distance Miles Left Bank128 KIVEE ROUTES Right Bank Total distance to the N. being thin and scattered.

When due W. of Beni Huteit Island the channel turned W. by S. and struck across the lake in this general direction for about 11m. In this 11-m. stretch the width of open channel was about ?&gt; m., and there is no clearly defined channel bed. The details of the channel may by now have altered considerably. Depth, Sept. 1, 1916, l,|-2 ft. The water shallows towards the N. and S., where the island-villages are situated. The course winds through reeds in a northerly direction, leaving the mouth of the Mezlaq Channel and the Mezlaq villages on the port bow. For the Mezlaq Channel see note at the end of section ii below. Channel in 1915 here turned NW. into the Haqiqeh Channel. At this point occurred the worst shallows of the entire route, soundings in a low river occasionally shoaling to 18 in. The channel was here some 400 yds. broad. As it proceeded W., it narrowed to about 200 yds. For some 4 m. it was marked on the N. by a narrow belt of low reeds, and on the S. by thick reed-beds extending to the dry land, on which are scattered the numerous villages and mud towers of the district of Jawabir. Soundings along the reach were 5-6 ft. in June 1915, and 3-4 ft. two months later. There is a 2-3 knot current during flood season. # Hereabouts is apparently the flood season's western limit of the Hammar Lake. Near this point Snfadiyeh.

The sounding at this cutting was 5 ft. 6 in. in June 1915, but it may in time scour deeper. [The Haqiqeh Bund when intact deflected the water into canals which irrigated the country in the S. ? and in some cases a limited area to the W.] Above the Haqiqeh Dam the channel takes a winding course in a general WSW. direction (depth 4-7 ft., August 1915). It is bordered on both sides by well-irrigated and valuable tree-growing land. There is much rice cultivation. Numerous Arab towers are visible from the channel. The land to the N. has been in recent years under water from January to May, but this state of affairs may have been altered by the destruction of the Haqiqeh Dam. Ma Shaireh or Mujaihishiyeh Creek joins the channel. This creek leaves the main stream of the Euphrates above Stlq esh-Shuyukh (see section iii, m. 5). In 1915 it was reported unfit for anything bigger than light bellams or motor-boats. To N. of its E. end is a large expanse of open water, about 7 m. long by 3 m. broad. The T.L. runs along the N. side of the creek. From the junction of the Ma Shrtreh Creek the channel continues in a W. direction with an average width of 100 to 150 yds. for 6^- m. to Mohammed el-Habi.

About 1,200 yds. from this bend it has Nahr Kharawi on the S. The S. bank is liable to inundation. There are date plantations which become gradually fewer on both banks. Near this point the channel enters a large expanse of shallow water which extends from the marshes round the Nahr 'Antar on the W. to the higher and firmer ground of the desert on the S. The area under water varies at different seasons. In the spring the low desert round Basra may be flooded, and farther W. continuous dry ground be reached only on the line Nukheileh, El-Lawi, Ratawi, Gubashlyeh, Legatteh.

The village has a mosque. W. of the southern end of Sandy Island lie some patches of low marshy ground, which, at least in the flood season, are separated from the mainland by water. The largest of these islands is called Chirbashi. Its N. end, known as Blockade Point, is about W. by S. of the N. end of the straits. S. of Blockade Point on the NE. side of the island is the deep indentation known as Molesworth Bay, and at its SE. end another inlet called Trafalgar Bay. The village of Chirbashi lies on the SE. end. Between Chirbashi and Abu Salabik lies the island of Jalat Salih. About 6 m. W. of Chirbashi Island is the mound rising from the marshes called Hampshire Hill. W. and SW. of the straits towards Blockade Point depths of 7^ ft. are charted (April). The direction of the channel is uncertain. It perhaps trends W. and then NW., passing through the swamp and between the island- villages that lie on the S. side of the Hammar Lake (see section i under m. 38, p. 124). In the Hammar Lake the Old Channel is joined. {Maheilehs and hellams coming from Gurmat c Ali can reach the Mezlaq Channel by ascending the Umm Naklah cut, the mouth of which is 3—4 m.

From. Samaweh, Museyib lies about NNW., and between the two towns the Euphrates runs in two great branches, the distance by river being on the westernmost or Hindiyeh Branch about 167 in., on the eastern or Hilla Branch about 173 m. The naYigation channel before the war followed the Hindiyeh Branch. Hilla and Hindiyeh Branches. —This great bifurcation of the river is of very ancient date, and may be traced back as far as the history of the country is known. The volume of water has at different periods shifted from one branch to the other, according as one or other of the channels has silted up or its moutb become obstructed. Some forty years ago the Hilla Branch carried by far the larger proportion of the water and was universally regarded as the main channel of the Euphrates: the Hindiyeh Branch was looked upon as little more than an irrigation channel. The closing of the head of the Saqlawiyeh Channel, a short distance above Eellujeh, increased very considerably the volume of water flowing past Museyib. The result was that the mouth of the Hindiyeh Branch gradually widened, and by 1886 was reported to be 85 yds. broad. In spite of the efforts of the Turkish Government, which constructed a dam of loose rubble and cement a short distance below the site of the present barrage, by 1903 the mouth of the Hindiyeh Branch had reached the width of 200 yards. The immediate effect of the Turkish Government's barrage had been to raise the level of the Hilla Branch by some 6 or 7 ft., and to cause one-third of the total volume of water to pass down it, though two- thirds still pursued the course of the Hindiyeh. This rectification was completely neutralized by the bursting of the new dam in July 1903, in consequence of which the water rushed at once into the Hindiyeh Branch. The result was that the Hilla Branch was left dry, except for a few weeks in the high-water season, and the boat-bridge at Hilla w*as seen in September 1908 lying on the dry bed of the river. This state of things at once proved disastrous for cultivation along the Hilla Branch, and the Government engaged Sir W. Willcocks (who had recently constructed the great barrage on the Nile at Assouan) toi **i£. \ \ CO J THE EUPHRATES—KOUTE IV C 147 make a survey with a view to checking the damage. He published his preliminary report in 1905, and closed the opening in the Old Barrage in 1909 ; but, this proving insufficient, he further proposed the con struction of a new barrage about i m, above the old dam with a head regulator for the Hilla Branch : work was begun on this barrage in 1910 and completed in 1913 (see further, on the barrages and regulator. Appendix 0, p. 464). These changes have greatly affected not only the actual course of the water, but the cultivation on its banks and the population of the district. In the days before its drying up the Hilla Branch had passed through a thickly inhabited region with many villages on its banks, and much cultivation of cereals and fruits: Hilla itself was a flourishing town and a great centre of agricultural commerce, and Diwamyeh was also prosperous. But the shifting of the water to the Hindiyeh Branch had produced a great change: cultivation practically ceased except in the immediate neighbourhood of Hilla, villages weie deserted and fell into decay, Hilla itself lost most of its prosperity, and the population gradually moved westwards towards the Hindiyeh Branch, which, however, is much less suited to support cultivation owing to the great Mors through which it runs and the near neighbourhood of the desert on its western side. The erection of the New Barrage and the regulation of the water-supply ought to bring back the district into cultivation and renew its former prosperity, but how far this process may have advanced at present it is impossible to say, and conditions can only be reported as they were before the completion of the barrage. It is improbable that its,erection will have a beneficial effect on the Hindiyeh Branch, as the great amount of water which must be passed through the barrage in flood-time will help to swell the great marshy areas lower down. The Hindiyeh Branch.— {a) Course. The Hindiyeh Branch imme diately above Samaweli enters on the region which in mediaeval times was the upper or broader portion of the Great Swamp. The swamp is represented in modern times by a series of or hhors, large marshy areas through which the river takes an uncertain course with a tendency to larger or smaller bifurcations. The first of these areas, consisting of the Khor Allah and Khor 'Uwaineh, lies N. of the 1. bank of the main channel, but a large branch (the navigation channel), known as the Shatt Khaasar, runs through the hhor, itself bifurcating and forming channels connecting with the Hindiyeh. Through the middle of the next swamp, the Bahr-i- Shinafiyeh, the river runs in an ill-defined channel, and enters it at its northern end in two distinct branches, the Kufeh and the k 2148 RIVER ROUTES Shamiyeh channels, which separate at Kifl and enclose between them a third swamp known as the Khor el-'Abbasiyeh : to the east of them, and between them and the Hilla Branch, lies yet a fourth swamp, the Khdr Abu Nejm. Above Kifl the two channels are again united in the Hindiyeh Branch, which leads NNW. past a sixth Mwr on the 1. bank to Tawarij, where it takes a turn NNE. and runs through firmer ground to the junction below Museyib. (6) Navigation. In most parts of this branch the river is navigable only for very small craft, except from March or February to the begin ning of July, when it is practicable for craft drawing 3-3f ft. The last occasion before the war on which a steamer, the ascended this branch was in the first week of July 1913: the vessel drew 3 ft. 2 in. The Shatt Khansar is tortuous and difficult: its width is 80-100 yds. From its upper end to Shinafiyeh the river is 150 yds. wide and navigation is fairly easy. At Shinafiyeh there seems to be a bar, on which at the beginning of February 1912 not more than 2 ft. 2 in.- 2 ft. 5 in. of water was found, though on the 14th of February the river had risen sufficiently to allow the passage of a vessel drawing 3 ft. Large hellams fully laden cannot navigate the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh in l.w. Above this lake the Shamiyeh arm is better for navigation than the Kufeh Channel, which is now practicable only for quite small craft. The Shamiyeh arm is 150 yds., wide except where islands reduce the breadth of the channel to about 50 yds. Navi gation is hampered here and up to the barrage by native irrigation ' dams. From Kifl to the Hindiyeh Barrage the width is about 200 yds. The lower (old) barrage is almost impassable, and the lock on the New Barrage is only 26 ft. wide. See Appendix C. (c) Country along Hindiyeh Bran The Euphrates valley is bordered on its SW. and W. sides by a sandstone ridge which forms the edge of the Syrian Desert. From Samaweh to the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh the old river-channel keeps close underneath this ridge, which reaches here a height of 50 to 100 ft. From this point for some 25 m. the edge of the desert recedes, and the river flows through lake and marsh. A few miles below Kufeh the desert ridge again comes near the course of the river, in the form of a tongue or promontory, on which Nejef stands; it then runs NW., receding from the river and leaving between itself and the stream a low plain constantly liable to flood, backed by a desert of sand and fine gravel. In this plain stands Kerbela, 20 miles W. of the Euphrates. On the edge of the desert W. of the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh and in the neighbourhood of Kerbela are a number of oases, the largest of which is Sliifatheh, about 30 m. W. of Kerbela. East of the Hindiyeh to the Hilla Branch lies a plain containing(tt) THE EUPHRATES—ROUTE IV C 149 large areas of marsh (see above). In the neighbourhood of the river cereals and dates are cultivated. The moist character of much of the country favours the growth of rice. TheHilla Branch. —(a) Course. The Hilla Branch runs in a single channel. The marshes have gradually shrunk towards the west, and left the country on the Hilla Branch comparatively dry. The branch, which has apparently of recent years abandoned the mouth by which it used to join the other branch some 5 m. below Samaweh in favour of a detour to the W., takes a general NNW. direction (as followed up-stream) with many windings and a sharp bend W. some 20 m. above the Shatt Dighareh, and again NNW. about 10 m. below Hilla. (b) Navigation. The Hilla Branch is now navigable, in h.w. at least, for large hellams, and probably for small steamers if the regu lator be left open. In ].w. it might be navigable if as much water as possible were turned down it. The lock at the regulator is 26 ft. wide. The Branch could be deprived of all its water at any season by the closing of the regulator. The Hilla Branch was unnavigable before the completion of the new Hindiyeh Barrage: it was indeed dry for some months every year. Before the barrage was finished the channel was cleared of silt for 50 miles from its upper end, and when the regulator was opened, 5 ft. of water had reached Hilla within 38 hours. Unfortunately, all the 50 to 60 more or less important distributary canals leaving the Hilla Branch between the barrage and Diwaniyeh are without regulators, and the amount of water taken off by them must so reduce the current in the branch that its bed may be now to a great extent silted up again, and without concerted effort by the tribes along the banks a recurrence of the old trouble is inevitable. The Hilla Branch is narrow, the channel being only 40-50 yds. wide between Samaweh and Imam Hamzeh, and 90-95 yds. near Diwaniyeh. There are native irrigation dams near Diwaniyeh and Hilla. (c) Country along the Hilla Branch. On the E. side there is open country throughout its course, which stretches away to the Shatt el-Hai and the Tigris, with some pasture in spring and a little cultivation supported by winter rains, but for most of the year bear ing only camel-thorn. The plain is broken by frequent trenches of old canals and by eminences, sometimes sand-hills, more often the ruin-heaps of dead cities. Here and there are Mors, but the marshes have probably decreased in the last 20 years. Thirty years ago much of this country was irrigated by large canals from the Hilla Branch, but some of these apparently failed with the drying of the Hilla Branch. According to the latest information (1916), in the150 KIVER ROUTES flood season the Shatt el-Khar is continuous from Diwaniyeh to the Butnijeh Lake N. of Nasirlyeh, but it is clammed about 2 days' journey from Diwaniyeh by the bund called Sagban. Over this no craft can be taken, and the water E. of it for 10 miles is shallow even in the wet season, and navigable then only for up to l^r tons ; in the l.w. season it is dry. After these 10 miles the channel deepens and it is always possible to reach the Butnijeh Lake by water. In the neighbourhood of Diwaniyeh this canal is apparently known as the Nahr Yusuflyeh. Above Diwaniyeh the Shatt Dfghareh takes off water to the SE. into the Khor 'Afej, and forms what is apparently still a fertile region of cultivation and villages^ SE. of the khor some of its water reaches the Shatt el-Khar. Above Hilla lies the district between Euphrates and Tigris, which was in ancient times fertilized by the system of canals (see vol. i, pp. 112 seqq. ), of which the lowest, the Sliatt en -Nil, runs E. from the ruins of Babylon to the neighbour hood of Kut el-Amara. W. of the Hilla Branch the country stretches away to the marshy ground of the great which lie along the Hindiyeh Branch, but there is always, even in the nanow est part, a considerable margin of ground comparatively free from flood. The Hilla Branch thus runs through country which with proper regulation of the water-supply ought to be, as apparently the greater part of it was until recent years, both fertile and populous. But the drying up of the river has done immense harm, and before the building of the 1914 barrage the condition of the country was becoming more and more desperate. Up to the Shatt Dighareh there was apparently little cultivation except occasional patches of arable land and the date-groves round Rumei- theh and Diwaniyeh. The shatt itself watered a comparatively fertile area, but was an additional danger to the Hilla Branch, as it carried off much of the little water which came down it. Above the shatt there seems to have been at one time an almost continuous stretch of date plantations with populous villages right up to Hilla — a any rate on the 1. bank but the limit of these has been gradually rece mg until it is doubtful now whether it stretches much more than 10 m. below Hilla. The existence of the barrage and legu ator should restore prosperity to the country on the Hilla tfranch. But an efficient scheme of control is needed for the irrigation. Under existing circumstances this cannot be expected, and the gradual decay and waste of irrigation works is certain, unless a new regime takes the place of the old at an early date.

The Kaza of Kerbela, which includes, besides the town ot Kerbela, Museyib and the oases in the desert to the W. Inhabitants. —The country between Samaweh and Museyib is occupied by a complex mass of tribes, or more or less independent tribal sections, whose positions and relations cannot be exactly deteimined here. In general the inhabitants may be described as Shiah Arabs, cultivators and stock-farmers, living in tents, or in mud or leed villages often containing mud or brick towers which are the dwellings of sheikhs or places of refuge for the villagers in case of attack. The following account mentions only the more important of the tribal groups. , • , t - j . i. * The Ktazail are the principal, though not the only, inhabitants ot an area which stretches approximately from Kufeh to Samaweh through the intervening marshes, and includes both a portion of the adjoining desert to the S. and the region E. of the lower couise of the Hilla Branch. Their more considerable sections are called Moallim, A1 Bu Hasan, Lamlum, and Eeni Aridh. They are partly settled, partly nomad. The agricultural members of the tribe apparently used to dwell mainly in the neighbourhood of the Hilla Branch, but have probably for the most part been driven westwards m recent years owing to lack of water. These agricultural Khaza il glow rice, barley, and w r heat, but a large number of them follow the deseitTHE EUPHEATES—ROUTE IV C 153 (about 9,000), who live chiefly in the Shamiyeh Kaza. The Beni Hasan are at feud with their neighbours the Baraji (400 fighting- men : Hindiyeh Kaza), and are variously reported as the friends or enemies of the tribe of A1 Bu Fatlah, an agricultural people number ing about 10,000, living mainly between Hilla and Tawarlj but extending also farther south into the Shamiyeh district. The A1 Bu Fatlah are allied with the Jaliheh (about 3,000) in the of Diwaniyeh and Hindiyeh, and with the Qarait (1,500 fighting- men), a well-armed tribe of cultivators and cattle-breeders living W; of the Hindiyeh Branch, above and below Tawarlj. The Hilla Kam is mainly populated by the A1 Bu Sultan, a sedentary tribe, poorly armed, with few horses, some of whom are found in the Kam of Nejef. They are said to be on bad terms with the Juheish., a much smaller group near Kerbela. The A1 Kinaneh, a small and quiet community W. of the Hindiyeh Branch between Suleimaniyeh village and the Abu Khasawi branch of the Duweihiyeh Canal, are apparently of some importance, as several of the neighbouring tribes (e, g. the Da'um and A1 Bu Samam) are said to be dependent on them. The Mas'ud live on both banks of the Huseiniyeh Canal, and also on the Mesharab Canal, and possibly on the left bank of the Euphrates a little above Museyib. The bulk of the tribe live in reed or thorn huts, but the sheikhs own brick-built towers. They number about 7,000 souls, and have a good reputation for courage and generosity. They are agriculturists and graziers, owning buffaloes, sheep, cattle, and about 1,000 horses. Only the sheikhs were reported (1908) to possess modern firearms. They are generally at feud with the Yasar (8,000), a scattered tribe living partly near Hilla, partly E. of Kerbela. Both Mas'ud and Yasar were before the war exempt from conscription for Turkish military service. The powerful desert tribe of the Anazeh visit the neighbourhood of Kerbela for two months in the year, and some of the Northern Shammar seek pasturage at certain times in the country to the E. of the Hilla Branch. A noticeable feature in the population of those towns in this region which are Shiah Holy Places is the number of Persians, who actually form the majority in Kerbela. See Kerbela, Nejef. These cities also contain about 3,000 Baluchis, who are said to have migrated from Baluchistan about 100 years ago, and some so-called Barbaras, who are believed to be of Afghan descent.154 RIVER ROUTES (i) HINDIYEH BRANCH.

It does not appear to Right Bank Total distance The river runs in a general WN W. direction to Shinafiyeh. Date plantations continue for some miles above Samaweh. The navigation channel follows the Shatt Khansar (see opposite), though it is very sinuous and presents considerable difficulties. Its width varies from 80 to 100 yds. It runs through marshes (Ehor 'Uwaineh to the N. and Khor Allah to the S.) and a number of side channels take off from it. Arab villages and forts are scattered along its banks. It rejoins the main branch of the Hindiyeh arm near the village of Seyyid Masquf (or Sheikh Muskhur). Apparently about ^ m. below its upper end is the site of an old dam. Navigation channel rejoins main arm of Hindiyeh Branch. From the upper end of the Shatt Khansar to Shinafiyeh the channel is about 150 yds. wide, and navigation is reported not to be difficult. The river appears to be shallow at Shinafiyeh (less than 2^ft. was reported early in February 1912, just before the rise of the river). Apparently there is a bar at the entrance to the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh.THE EUPHRATES—ROUTE IV C (i) 155 be correct as regards distances, though in other respects it is probably a considerable improvement on the W.O. maps, which are based mainly on surveys of 1849-60, For a general account of navigation see p. 148.

In 1908 it was stated that the inhabitants of Shinafiyeh maintained, or had formerly maintained, a kind of primitive lighthouse at the southern end of the lake. This is a large swampy area the present size of which it is impossible to determine exactly from the evidence available : it may be 10-12 m. from N. to S., and 9-15 m. broad. In October 1915 it was described as a large shallow lake. In 1908 it was said that the Sa^rwas a lake from January to May, but was steadily silting up, so that during the other months the greater part of it dried up. The water is said to be almost undrinkable owing to the gypsiferous soil. The hahr is largely covered with reeds and is studded with small reedy islands. In the upper portion are several larger islands rising to some height, of which the principal are known as the Tel TerumTbah and the Qal ah es-Saqi. Some of the islands contain Arab forts. On the E. lies an area liable to flood, through which runs the Shatt er- Humahiyeh. On the SW. the desert plateau runs close to the border of the marsh for 11m. to a point where'a large wadi runs into the hahr from SSW. : between it and the mouth of the Wadi el-Khar (or Umm Kusair) (2^ m.) lie the wells and palm-groves of 'Ain Biyar and 'Ain Bderi.

Apparently in July 1913 a depth of 4-5 ft. of water was found about 2 m. above the mouth, thereafter increasing to 5-7 ft. The channel is said to be easily navigable (in the flood season ?) by steamers of the ordinary type found on the Mesopotamian rivers, but navigation is hampered by native irrigation dams, which are built out from the banks and have only a narrow fairway with a strong current.

It is reported navigable for country boats. It runs in a SE. direction for about 12 m. to a group of villages called Dighareh, inhabited by a mixed Arab population. In the neighbourhood of these villages the canal breaks up into a number of channels which create a moist area capable of producing wheat, barley, and rice : in 1908 there were reed- hut villages here. A short distance farther on the waters recombine into a large reed-bearing marsh, called Khor 'Afej, running ESE. for 15-20 m. with an average breadth of 4-5 m. About 2 m. from the W. end is the large island of Cherdaq, which stretches almost from the N. to the S. bank, and in the W. part of the are other smaller islands. At its lower end issue small streams which rapidly unite to form the Shatt el-'Afej (or Mikliriyeh) near a collection of villages known as Afej (see 20 b, m. 38). On the W. side of the Khor c Afej lie some small villages with cultivation, and to the NE. of the lake, about 6 m. N. of 'Afej village, are the extensive ruin-mounds of Nippur (now called Niffur), an ancient Babylonian city which contained the sanctuary of the god En-lil, and flourished from about the fourth millennium to the seventh century b.c . It is now a group of broken mounds, the highest of which is a conical hill lying to NE., about 100 ft. high. Eunning through the mounds from SE. to NW. is the line of an ancient canal, a branch of the Shatt en-Nil.

On the E. side of the first two groups are the traces of an inner wall running between NNW. and N. by W., from the S. end of which can be traced the remains of a larger encircling wall which goes ENE. for about 2,000 yds., then turns NW., and continues for nearly 3,500 yds. to the canal- bed immediately S. of Babil. In the triangle formed by the inner and outer walls is marshy ground. The modern Hilla— Baghdad road runs through the ruins from S. to N., passing just E. of the remains of the interior wall. Excavations have been carried out for some fifteen years on all the mounds by German archaeologists. The ruins on the Tel c Imran are scattered and not prominent. El-Qasr contains remains of the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar (first half of sixth century e.g .). The site of the palace is an irregular square of about 700 yds., and masses of burnt brick of considerable height are still standing in the excavation-trenches.

River and Neighbourhood. —From Museyib, Fellujeh lies v 47 m. NW. : the distance by river is 71 m. The river runs in a general direction NNW. to the neighbourhood of Imam Hamzeh, then WNW. with many windings to Fellujeh. The river is usually from 150 to 300 yds. broad : the height of the banks above the water in the months of low river is about 10 ft., but in flood they are liable to be overflowed. Between Khan Maqdam and Fellujeh attempts have been made to confine the river by means of earth embankments about 8 ft. wide at top and 20 ft. high, revetted on the side towards the stream; but these have not proved very effective, and occasionally burst. The undulating ground occasionally requires levees 15 to 18 ft. high, which to be efficient would have to be carefully designed. The depth in this stretch has been reported to be 3^-6J ft. at low water, and 18 ft. in flood : velocity (in January) 3 ft. per second. Steamer-navigation would probably become easier with time, as the channel was scoured out. See Appendix C.

The Euphrates and Tigris are during this section from 25 to 45 m. apart, and the intervening Mesopotamia' is inter sected by traces of the ancient canal system. The most important place in it is Mahmudiyeh on the Museyib—Baghdad road, m. E. of the mouth of the Mahmudiyeh Canal (see 21 a, m. 21). The r. bank is occupied by a broad plateau of salted desert of gypsum and marl, the SE. corner of which lies just above Museyib. This plateau extends to the Habbaniyeh Lake, v 50 m. NW. of Museyib and 11 m. WSW. of Eellujeh (see vol. iii, IV E): on the W. it reaches a broad depression, which was apparently an ancient reservoir, about v 26 m. W. of Museyib. On the W. side of this depression lie the populous cultivated tracts of Shifatheh and Rahaliyeh (see Route 17). See further Appendix C. Land communications. —Mesopotamia is traversed in this section by the great road running N. from Museyib to Baghdad (see Route 21 a). There is also a route from Museyib to Fellujeh along the 1. bank (see Route 18), which at Khan Maqdam apparently throws off a branch track to join the Eellujeh—Baghdad road (Boute 22) at Nuqtah.

On the 1. bank in the country immediately above Museyib are some sections of Uasud and a tribe called Janabiyyin, said to number about 10,000, mostly Sunnis. They are reputed to be brave and generous, and live as agriculturists, as watch men, and sometimes as thieves. A considerable number of them are said to be settled in Baghdad. The Janabiyyln in the Museyib district are allies of the Mas'ud. To the N. and E. of the Jana biyyln, the country {Kiizu of Kazimain) is occupied by a number of clans, much intermingled, of which some are sections of the Zobeid (as the 'Ugeil and 'Azzeh, who are Sunnis), others divisions of the Beni Rabi ah (as the Qoreish, Kawam, and Tamim).

The Shatt el-Hai, as it is usually called by Europeans, though the local Arabs are said to know no other name for it than Shatt el- Gharaf, runs from the Tigris at Kut el-Amara in a S. by E. direction, and is connected with the Euphrates about 5 m. below Nasirlyeh by a succession of canals known as the Umm Sakhal, Umm Jemal, Abu Helah, Muhsin, and Sadanawlyeh. The current in the channel runs in general from the Tigris to the Euphrates, but the difference between the levels of its upper and lower ends is inconsiderable, and it is said that floods in the Euphrates for a time reverse the current in the lower reaches. From the lower course of the Shatt el-Hai two large canals drain off a large volume of water SE. to the Hammar Lake. One of these, the Shatt el-Beidha (or Beda'ah), leaves the Shatt el-Hai about 2 m. above the town of Shatret el-Muntefiq. The other, the Nahr Hamzeh or Shatt el-Ibrahim, branches off about v 2() m. below Shatreh at the village of Hamzeh.

The surrounding country is cultivated, and cut up by small canals, most of which flow from the Nahr Abu Ghoreib. On 1. bank in this reach is the edge of a high pebbly desert, which lies between the Nahr Abu Ghoreib and the Nahr es-Saqlawiyeh on the N. and stretches E. for about tl4 m. to the neighbourhood of Nuqtah 22, m. 23^).

The only reliable through route from the S. is by the Shatt el-Beidha from the Hammar Lake. This is practicable for large hellams from December to July. In 1916 three motor- boats were brought down this canal, but with considerable difficulty and much local assistance. In the high-water season it expands into a wide Mior, and its overflow fills numerous parallel side channels. The Nahr Hamzeh is navigable by small from December to J uly. Normally in the high-water season large hellams pass up the Khor Huseiniyeh in the flood season from the Euphrates to the NE. limit of the Khor (about 6 m. from Suweij). From Suweij to Abu Mahau the Shatt el-Hai (here called the jiil: Shatt esh-Shatreh) is about 12 ft. broad and about 2^ ft. deep in the I high-water season. It is dry, or at least useless for navigation, in jsii low water (? August to February). lu From Abu Mahau to Kut el-Amara the Shatt is navigable by mil steamers of 4-| ft. draught from February to June.

Beyond the fringe of cultivation desert with patches of marshland stretches away on either side. Inhabitants. —The Shatt el-Hai in the greater part of its course runs through the territory of the Muntefiq and the section and dependants of that tribe. These include the Beni Rishab to the W. in the neighbourhood of Sheikh Khidhr and the Beni Hashim round Qal'at es-Sikkar, a small tribe which according to one account is to be identified with a section of the Qoreish from which the Prophet came. In the neighbourhood of Kut el-Amara are found the Beni Rabl'ah, the Shatt forming the boundary between the Ma'lyeh section on the W. and the Serai on the E. In winter some of the Shammar Toqah descend to the region W. of Kut el-Hai, and so come into conflict with the Muntefiq. (For the land route from Nasirlyeh to Kut el-Amara along the Shatt el-Hai and the towns and villages on the latter see 19 a, and for routes connecting the northern part of the Shatt with the Tigris below Kut el-Amara see JRoute 19b.)LAND ROUTES THE EEGION OF THE SHATT EL-ARAB ROUTE 1 FAO—BASKA (68^ m.) Authorities;- —Lorimer, Gazetteer of the 1908; Route Report of December 1913; Field Notes 1915. This route runs beside the telegraph line, within two miles of the r. bank of the Shatt el-Arab, between the date-groves and the desert. The date-groves are generally within a few hundred yards of it, on the right. Before the present war it was regularly used by the inhabitants of this region for going to and from Basra, on foot or on horseback, but it was not used for the transport of merchandise, which followed the river route. There was then a section of the route, from Fao telegraph office to Maamir (see below, m. 0-m. 6), which presented difficulties to wheeled transport ; but beyond Ma amir the road was reported excellent the whole way, except in wet weather or after floods, when for as much as a month at a time it might become too soft for carts. The edges of the date-gardens are throughout bounded by embank ments, which would provide good cover for troops. The belt of trees varies from 2 m. to a few hundred yards in breadth. The desert provides good camping-grounds everywhere in the dry season. In the high-river season it is flooded, but camp could always be pitched among the palm-trees, though the ground would be damp. Further information on most of the places mentioned below is given in Route I A. Besides this track, which is described below, there are said to be two others between it and the river. These are :— (i) A track leading from village to village called or ' Inter-188 LAND KOUTES mediateThis one is nearer to the Shatt el-'Arab than the main route, and it is shaded throughout by date-groves, but its course is winding, and it is poorly provided with bridges, many of the numerous creeks and deep irrigation trenches encountered being spanned only by a single date-log or crossed by means of ferry-boats. (ii) A third track, known as Hadar or 'Lower', runs between Wasti and the river bank, and appears to be the most difficult and discontinuous of the three. Each village stands on a creek generally providing good and plentiful water. There are no wells, but water is always easy to obtain from the creeks or the river. The banks would generally require to be ramped to enable animals to get to the water's edge. Near the sea, water should be taken with the falling tide, especially when the river is low. There is much dry date-palm wood for fuel. Plenty of short grass inside the date plantations for fodder. Lucerne and barley are exten-. sively grown, and, in places, rice. Outside the date plantations there is no grazing except in spring for sheep. Large quantities of dates, and a little straw and barley at hamlets. Meat generally abundant; fair supply of milk. A few donkeys and indifferent horses in many hamlets. A considerable number of boats could be collected. Miles from Pao 0 6 Pao. For description see Route I A, m. The route leaves Pao in a general NN W. direction, striking away from the river through date-groves to the desert. From near the fort, 4 m. below the telegraph station at Fao, to Ma c amir, about 6 m. above it, a new embank ment has been made to keep out the salt water which floods the desert to the W. Horses and men can go along the top of this embankment, but wheeled transport would have to keep to the W. side of it on desert soil, and this is generally bad going for wheels, as it is at this point a salt mud-flat which never dries and is flooded at high tides. Ma amir tract. In this region and in the Dawasir district (see m. 18 below) there are numerous empty villages about 400 yds. from the date-groves. Their defensible village- walls still remain. They are 90-100 yds. square. Ma* amir, Sheikh Naghaimish's village. Track is now over dry, hard desert, except in wet weather, and after high tide in spring when the river is in flood: it is then very boggy.

In December 1913 this point was reached from Gatah (see under m. 35) in 8 hrs. by a party on horseback with pack animals. The latter part of the way was very soft going owing to rain and inundations. A few creeks run about half a mile into the desert, but they can easily be turned. Dorah (Salili bin Ibrahim) village ; milk, a few sheep and chickens. The going behind Dorah was found in December to be very soft and difficult owing to the flooding of the land W. of the date-palms for irrigation purposes. The ground was to some extent flooded in the same way elsewhere in this region. The route now enters the Dawasir district (see above under m. 6), and traverses the Faddaqlyeh tract, in which is the village of Kut el-Khalifeh. Route then traverses Dd'irat es land.

In this tract is a place called Aradeh, which affords a good camping-ground (reported to be 'the only good spot' found between Fao and Basra by a party which went over the route in 1908). The ground is firm and dry, and there is plenty of lucerne in the neighbourhood. A clear view is obtained across the main channel of the Shatt el-'Arab to Haji Salbuq Island. Route now traverses the tract of Gatah with 7 hamlets. The islands of Haji Salbuq, Bariyeh, and Gatah lie off this tract.

Authority : —Force ' D ' Route Report, Serial no. 4 (from Reports of 1915, 1916). This route is practicable throughout for all arms except during the high flood season (April, May, and June). During the greater part of these months considerable portions of the road up to the neighbour hood of Steamer Point (see under m. 37) are liable to be flooded. Pack transport could move over the road in normal years up to about the middle of April. Beyond Steamer Point there is an embanked road usually above flood-level, though it was under water in the floods of 1916. After rain the road becomes in parts very heavy and difficult for wheeled traffic. The following report refers only to the period of the year during which the road is normally open, July-March inclusive, except where otherwise stated. The road crosses five bridges (m. 4, 6, 30, 37, 42), all of which are capable of carrying field guns. There are also a few shallow creeks, the sides of which need ramping for wheeled traffic. For conditions of river-transport see IB. From Gurmat Ali (m. 3 below) to the bend of the river about 5 m. below Nahr 'Umr {Eoute IB, m. 16|), the bank is of shelving mud stretching 20-30 yds. from the water, and the disembarkation of stores is difficult. On the remainder of the route good landing-places are easily found.192 LAND ROUTES A T.L. (two wires on iron tubular posts) runs near the road the whole way. Water is good and plentiful from the Shatt el-'Arab and the creeks flowing out of it. The marsh water is generally brackish and un- drinkable. Dates, eggs, chicken, sheep, grain, milk, and wild duck can be bought in small quantities from villages There is a certain amount of scrub, suitable for cattle-grazing and fuel, to the W. of the road. There is unlimited camping space except during the flood season (March-June inclusive), when the marshes run close alongside the road, or actually flood it. So long as the road itself is not closed by floods, enough dry camping space can be found for at least one brigade of infantry. The camping-ground at Steamer Point, though usually above flood level, was under water May-July, 1916. Miles from Basra 0 4^ 2 Basra. The starting-point is about 1 m.

Grood water from the Shatt el-Arab, to which the approaches are easy. can come alongside opposite the camping-ground. General direction from here to Shafi, NW. Road follows course of the Shatt el-Arab, keeping about 1 m. from it. It is passable by all arms; it traverses a mud plain, which in dry weather is good going, but becomes slippery and heavy after rain. A few water-cuts are crossed, which need ramping for heavy traffic. For 1 m. after leaving camp the road is heavy and sandy. Cross a creek, which in the flood season has about 2 ft. of water in it, and needs ramping for wheeled traffic. For 1 m. from this point some mounds standing about 20 ft. above the plain are passed on either side of the road.

Via Left Bank of the Tigris Authority .—Force 1 D' Route Report, Serial no. 2 (February, 1916). This route is liable to inundation from March to June inclusive and the going is bad also after heavy rain. For areas mentioned as liable to flood see under m. 6, m. 27^, m. 61, m. 64, m. 68^, m. 96^. In high flood a spill may take place at Lajj (m. 84) which may inundate the country down to 'Azlziyeh (m. 61) or even to Dabuni (m. 35). The breaching of the bun at Baghdad would flood the whole country down to the Diyaleh (m. 103). In the dry season (Sept.-Dec. inclusive) the going is fairly good throughout, and it was reported in Feb. 1916 that the road could be made suitable for motor-lorries at that time of year with slight improvements. Miles from Amara 26 27^ m 334 34i 37 39 51i 62204 LAND EOUTES There are several canals and irrigation cuts which need ramping for wheeled traffic. None of these requires bridging except where noted in the itinerary. Water is good and plentiful from the Tigris. Information is given with regard to watering-places, but these vary considerably from year to year. A limited number of sheep and cattle can be obtained from villages and Arab encampments en route. Considerable quantities of bhusa and grain for fodder can be obtained from villages and Arab encampments Camel- grazing is plentiful, but there is very little grazing for horses. Wood fuel can be obtained only at Qutniyat (m. 68|), but scrub jungle is plentiful. In time of high flood the only places that can be counted on as having considerable areas above flood-level are Kut el-Amara, Bagh- dadiyeh (see under m. 76) and Ctesiphon (m. 93). A T. L. runs roughly parallel with, and often contiguous to, the route. For the river-route see Boute III C, and Appendix B. Miles from Kut el- Amara o 6 10 Kut el-Amara (camping-ground). General direction to m. 16, WNW. Eoad runs NW. from camping-ground for about 2 m.: on this stretch in Feb. 1916 it needed improvement for wheeled transport by filling in water- cuts, &amp;c. (The Turks subsequently made a road from their camp at Shumran passing N. of Kut to the 1. bank of the Tigris opposite Maqasis.) Route joins old caravan-route. From here to m. 6 the going is good. The track runs for the greater part of the way along an old canal. The side-tracks leading to the river are very sandy and heavy. Route turns SW. to river and runs along river bank to m. 10, through the Zoweir Hammad tract. There are here two tracks : the upper one is dry and dusty but affords good going for horses and vehicles: the lower track has in the dry season a hard damp surface said to be ' excellent for infantry but doubtful for guns'; in the flood season this lower track would probably be under water. The river bank is covered with scrub: owing to its steepness, watering would be difficult. Track, continuing in same general direction, leaves the river, which here makes a considerable detour to S. (through El-Qayet esh-Sharqi and El-Qayet el-GrharbiROUTE 5c 205 tracts). From here to m. 15 track is sandy and heavy and easily cut up. Track again meets river where the latter makes an elbow- bend {Route III C, m. 25). Camping-ground (cf. introduction to this route). Scrub for fuel plentiful. Watering easy from river. From here to m. 35 general direction is WNW. Track runs NW. for about 1,000 yds., and then turns due W. The going is heavy. Pass big tomb visible for about 3 m. Good camping- grounds may be found anywhere in the next 2 m. Stone bridge over a water-cut which could be made passable by ramping if the bridge were destroyed. Sheikh Ja ad ruins to N. of road. No village here. Fairly high ground in this neighbourhood affords a good site for a camp, but no fuel is obtainable and watering is likely to be difficult owing to the steepness of the banks. Eoad apparently now turns N, (There appears to be some confusion in the Route Report here followed, which says, ' After crossing the stone bridge the road runs due N. for m. towards the ruins of Sheikh Ja'ad.') Route turns NW. and follows line of old canal for 4 m. This portion of the road is very good for all arms. Bogheileh lies about S. from here, on r, bank of the Tigris, and a track from the 1. bank opposite to it joins the present route in this neighbourhood. This track, which is reported to be used by herds, continues NE. towards Jessan, joining Route 9, ' About, 6 m. from Sheikh Ja ad' the old canal joins an old bed of the river. Road continues over slightly undulating ground, the lower parts of which are liable to form swamps in the flood season. These can be avoided by keeping closer to the river-bank. Road turns due W. to meet the river. Watering is here difficult, as the banks are steep. Scrub for fuel is plentiful. From here road runs due N. to m. 32.

Good fuel and easy watering can be found about 1 m. farther along the bank. From here the general direction to m. 61 is NNW. The road runs over bare ground for 8 m. Scrub begins again. Road very dusty. 'Aziziyeh. T. About 80 mud houses and a few shops. (See further Route III 0, m. 102.) Unlimited space for camping on fairly high ground, dry in flood season, except possibly when an exceptionally high flood has caused a spill at Lajj. Cf. introduction to this route. No supplies can be counted on. There is a certain amount of scrub jungle available for fuel near the village. Watering is easy from the Tigris. From here to m. 76 general direction is NW. To avoid the marsh and irrigation cuts mentioned below under m. 64 a detour to N. may be made; on leaving 'Aziziyeh turn NE. to Halirawan Canal, which is then followed until the marshes are passed. The distance by this route to Zeur (m. 76 below) is about 25 m. The going is fairly good at all seasons. The direct road runs nearly due W. from 'Aziziyeh near the T.

Here there are easy watering- places in the dry season, but in the flood season the banks are steep and watering is difficult. From here road runs NW. direct to Zeur. There is a continuation of the marsh to r., but wheeled transport can pass except during an unusually high rise. Eoad close alongside T. L. An alternative route to Zeur is as follows : Proceed due N. from Qutniyat for about 4 m., across marl plateau ; then turn due W. to Zeur. Zeur or Robaideh {Route III C, m. 128^). The Zeur camping-ground is ^ m. N. of Zeur. About 2^ m. S. of Zeur is ' the comparatively high ground of Bagh- dadiyeh'. This seems to refer to ground on the 1. bank opposite Baghdadiyeh up-stream of Zeur III C, m. 12(l|; also m. 78, below). Firewood plentiful at 1 m. from Zeur camping-ground in grounds of Mohammed Pasha Daghistani's house: watering for a large number of animals is difficult. From here general direction to Bustan is WNW. The going is good, except after rain, when it becomes heavy. Pass Mohammed Pasha Daghistani's house, about 2 m. S. of road. Near it is a good camping-site on fairly high ground. A branch T. L. takes off from main line and crosses the Tigris on two high poles, which form a good landmark, to Suweireh, for which see III C, m. 129^. From the point where the branch T. L. strikes off, a track runs NW. along a slight ridge, which continues up to the Diyaleh river at its confluence with the Tigris. This road passes about 6 in. N. of Otesiphon. The going is good at all times for all arms, but there is no water on this route all the way from Zeur to the Diyaleh (28 m.).208 LAND ROUTES Miles from Kut el- Amara 84 91 93 96i 961 103 Lajj {Route III C, m. 150-J). In this neighbourhood road crosses an old spill channel by an embankment about 80 yds. long and 30 ft. wide. The breadth of the depression is about 40 yds., its depth about 20 ft.; the banks are steep. When the Tigris is low, the depression can be crossed by all arms close to the river bank. If the embankment were breached the channel would have to be bridged (see, further, introduction to this route). Road strikes the river at Bustau III 0, m. 163J). Good site for camp on fairly high ground. Plentiful scrub for fuel. Watering easy at all seasons. From here to m. 103 the general direction is NNW. Pass to E. of Ctesiphou and Salman Pak (see III 0, m. 1691; and 170?,). In this neighbourhood are several irrigation canals about 15 ft. wide. The bridges over these needed some improvement. A good site for a camp may be found on the sand-hills close to the Arch of Ctesiphon, a most conspicuous landmark. There are no supplies nor fuel obtainable, but there is good watering near the Mudlr's house 1 m. NW. (or W.?: see Route III 0, m. 170^) of Salman Pak. Road crosses some sand-hills and passes over three canals with brick bridges. The canals are about 12 ft. deep and 15 ft. wide. Pass Qnseibeh village. From here to the Diyaleh road does not touch the Tigris, which makes a bend to the E. The high poles carrying the T. L. across the Diyaleh are visible from Quseibeh. Road throughout this stretch is liable to floods. There are a few shallow canals to be crossed, but these are not obstacles to movement. Diyaleh village, near mouth of Diyaleh river, which is about 170 yds. broad at its confluence with the Tigris, and is crossed by a pontoon bridge of 13-16 pontoons • (cf. vol. iii. Route 31, m. 9). The banks are precipitous and about 30 ft. high in l.w. On the Diyaleh river are six pumping houses, five of which are on the r. bank. Near the fifth, counting from S. to N., and about 10 m. N. of Diyaleh, is a ford called Terumbah el-Tufik Bey, but this is impracticable from December to April. There is said to be no fuel at Diyaleh, but there appearsROUTE 5c 209 uri Miles from Kut el- Amara 107 110^ 112 to be tamarisk scrub on the banks of the Diyaleh river. Watering from the Tigris is easy. In the dry season there is unlimited space for camping on either side of the Diyaleh. In the wet season both banks are liable to flood, and the best site for a camp is on the high ground at Bustan Mai Terumbah on the r, bank of the Diyaleh, in a loop of that river, 4 m. from 1. bank of the Tigris: at this camping-ground fuel is plentiful and watering easy, and a good road runs from it direct to Baghdad.

Via E ight B ank of the K akun Authorities:' —Force Eoute Eeports, Serial nos, 11 (with correction) and 13. The latter is confused in the description of the route from Dalr to Sab'ah. This route is for nearly all its length undefined, as most of the traffic between Mohammareh and Ahwaz goes by river. The country is a flat open alluvial plain, sandy in parts, and generally unculti vated. As far as Dalr and Salmaneh camping-grounds (m. 10), the route becomes impassable for wheeled transport in the flood season or after heavy rain, and is then very difficult, if not impassable, for pack animals. See further under m. 0. Beyond Salmaneh the route is said to be passable for cavalry, infantry, light field artillery, and A. T. carts, but it is very heavy after rain, and may become hardly practicable. The going beyond Sabah (m. 42) is good in dry weather. The route as a whole is easy from August to December. It is not stated whether light motors could be taken in the dry season over the direct route from Mohammareh to Dalr or Salmaneh. They can be used in the dry season only between Manduwan (four or five miles NNW. of Mohammareh) and Salmaneh, and, apparently more generally, from Salmaneh onwards. It is recommended that they should not be taken singly, but in pairs, as there are soft places due to mud or sand, and cars have sometimes to drag one another out of difficulties. The route as a whole is quite impassable for heavy cars: and it is said to be impossible to find practicable detours. There are only occasional stretches suitable for heavy lorries, the most important being one of 7 m. which begins 8 m. ENE. of Manduwan, and another which begins 6-8 m. S. of Sab c ah, and extends for 12-14 m. to Qajariyeh (m. 48). For the best way for motors between Salmaneh and Sabah see note (ii) under m. 10.V ROUTE 6 a 211 In April 1915 General Gorringe's column marched without guns and wheeled transport from Basra to Manduwan by 3, and thence to Salmaneh (see note under m. 0), where the guns and wheeled transport which bad proceeded by river joined the column. Thence all arms marched by 'Ali ibn el-Husein (see note under m. 26) to Sab'ah, and from Sab'ah by this route to the camping- ground at m. 61. For river-transport on the Karun see pp. 62-4. Places where barges and maheilehs can conveniently come alongside are mentioned in the itinerary. The T. L. now runs from Mohammareh along the r. bank of the Karun to Dalr Island, where it crosses the river. Thence it follows the 1. bank to Ahwaz. The old telegraph poles seem to be still standing along the r. bank above Dalr. In the hot months of June, July, August, there are generally strong NW. winds and much dust. Rain seldom falls before December, but in that month and in January it is frequent. Rain storms continue at intervals during February, March, and occasionally in April. For floods on the Karun see p. 61. Water (from the Karun) is good and plentiful. There are no supplies worth considering except in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz. In February, March, and April there is some grazing for horses from Adhrat Island (m. 26) onwards : it is best near Sab'ah. There is no grazing for horses at other times. Camel-grazing and scrub fuel are fairly abundant. Unlimited space is available for camping- grounds. Miles from Moham- mareli 0 Mohammareh. From here to Dalr (or the Salmaneh camping-ground : see under m. 10), the direct route is generally impassable in the flood season or after heavy rain. But when the Karun river alone is in flood, and not the Shatt el-Arab as well, it is sometimes possible to find a route by making a detour to N., about 4 m. longer than the direct route. The detour is as follows :—Proceed N., passing 2 m. from (E. of?) the village of Manduwan (see 3, m. 18). Two canal-bridges would need widening to make this part of the route passable for wheeled transport: see Route 3, m. 21. At a point about ENE. of Manduwan turn nearly ENE. (64°), and proceed to the river. The track between Manduwan and the Salmaneh camping-ground (see under m. 10 below) is good going for all arms in the dry season : from a point 3 m. ENE. of Manduwan there is then a o 2212 LAND ROUTES Miles from Moham- mareh stretch of about 7 m. suitable for heavy lorries. The track appa rently becomes quite impassable for wheeled transport when both the Karun and the Shatt el^Arab are in flood, and it is then very difficult or impracticable for pack-animals. The direct route is as follows:—Leave the town, skirt the northern wall, and proceed at first NE. The soil is clay and in many places swampy: date plantations occur here and there. Eoad becomes a mere track across a mud flat. The country to N. is barren, but a belt of cultivation fringes the Karun. Eoute lies over country which becomes a large swamp in spring rains. Small village. Date plantations about 1 m. to r. The going after rain is heavy and swampy. Pass Qisbeh, small village of reed and straw huts, situated on the 1. bank of a muddy creek about 50 yds. wide and 3 ft. deep, which is often difficult to ford. Dair Island in the Karun. There is usually a site for a camp on the r. bank hereabouts, but its exact position varies with the state of the floods, and also with the condition of the river, which determines what places are most suitable for bringing barges alongside. Grazing for camels, but for no other animals. There is a camping-ground about 2-3 m. farther up the Karun, 1 m. below Salmaneli Island. Water good and plentiful from river. Landing-place good. Plentiful camel-grazing in neighbour hood. Limited supply of brushwood fuel. No supplies. (i) From here a track runs to Eubin^s Tomb and Rehvali (see m. 24, below') somewhat nearer the river than that described below from Dair Island. It is good going for all arms in dry weather, but after rain it becomes heavy for wheeled transport, and in the flood season the first 5 m. are liable to inundation. There are a few shallow nullahs to be crossed : these form no obstacle. (On the better road for motors from this camping-ground to SaVah see (ii) below.) From Salmaneh camping-ground strike due N. till the river is met m. 5. Here there is a good landing-place and un limited space for camping, with a little grazing and fuel. At m. 10 from Salmaneh pass Rubin's Tomb and Rehvali on r. of track. Hereabouts the route from Dair is met. (ii) The way for motors from Salmaneh camping-ground to Sab e ah (m. 42, below) keeps farther away from the river, and goes straight for a point 3-4 m. W. of Rehvali. Thence continue N., leaving e Ali ibn el-Husein (see note under m. 26 below) about 8 m. to E. Up to a point 6-8 m.

Opposite this island is a good site for a camp, with a convenient place for barges to come alongside. There is good camel-grazing, and (in spring) scanty grazing for horses 1-| m, W. of the camp. From Adhrat Island to Sab'ah (m. 42, below), a route alternative to that described below runs nearer to the river: it is good going for all arms in dry weather, but becomes very heavy after rain. From m. | to m. 2 a marsh extends along 1. of track and about 2 m. from it : the water of the marsh is drinkable, and there is good grazing for horses in spring along its edge. At m. 4 (m. 5 ?) there is a camping-ground by the river opposite a palm-tree (or trees ? see Route 6 b, m. 29) on the eastern bank (*Ali ibn el-Husein); space unlimited. Water is good and plentiful from the river, but owing to the steepness of the banks buckets must be used. Landing- place good. Limited quantity of scrub fuel and camel-grazing. No supplies. The tomb of Seyyid Abud is a conspicuous landmark to NW. The track to Sab'ah (11 or 12 m. from this camping-ground) passes 3 m. E. of the tomb. At m. 5 from the camp the date palms of Sab'ah become visible. From here the country W. of the track is much cultivated, with plenty of grazing for horses in spring. From Adhrat Island strike N. There is no sign of a road. The going is rather soft with treacherous boggy spots. Water-cuts are minor obstacles. For the way for motors, which lies apparently somewhat W. of this line, see note (ii) under m. 10. There are a few pools of water in the bed of the Hamma- miyeh canal, and 4^ m. farther on, in the Aon, there is good water, but it is too muddy for men. Shortly after passing the Aon the tomb of Seyyid Abud becomes visible, and 2 m. before passing this tomb the palm-trees of Sab ah come in sight. Sab ah. (The distance given from Adhrat Island is perhaps a mile or two too long.) Sab'ah village is a collection of miserable huts. The camping-ground is 300 yds. to S. of the village. There is a convenient place on the214 LAND EOUTES river-bank for barges to come alongside. The plain in the neighbourhood is fairly well cultivated. A limited quantity of khasil (green barley) is available in season. In spring there is fair grazing for horses in the vicinity. A sweet-smelling grass, called in Persian is found in some abundance. There is also good camel- grazing. The water in the river is muddy, but clears quickly if allowed to settle. Abundant tamarisk fuel. From Sab'ah to the Farsiyat camping-ground the general direction is N. According to one authority (Force ' D' Route Report, Serial no. 13) there is no sign of a road, but poles of broken-down T. L. mark the route. But see under m. 48. The country is flat, and the going is firm and fit for all arms and A. T. carts, but rather rough in places. As far as Qajariyeh the route is fit for heavy lorries: thereafter to Ahwaz it is practicable for light cars only, except in a very few stretches. Track crosses a stretch of cultivation and grass-land extending to Qajariyeh. This affords plentiful grazing for horses in spring. Qajariyeh. From this point (or from 1 m. farther on), the track to Farsiyat is said (Force ' D' Route Report, Serial no. 11) to be well defined. But see above under m. 42.

Good landing-place with steep banks. Water good and plentiful. Limited camel-grazing and scrub fuel. No supplies. From here the track runs in a general NE. direction, mainly over open flat desert, which is for the most part covered with short grass affording grazing. Several stretches of cultivation are crossed.

It is accompanied by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's pipe-line to Abbadan and the telephone, which has call-boxes (1916) at Marid and near m. 29 and 45. In 1906-7 it was chiefly used by messengers, who generally followed this route between the Marid stream and Ahwaz, crossing the Karun by ferry at the former point. There was little caravan traffic, as most of the traffici between Mohammareh and Ahwaz was by boat.216 LAND EOUTES After vain the whole of the country passed over becomes sodden and heavy; the ground on the 1. bank is said to be more liable to inundation than the other. Certain parts of the ground passed over are impregnated with salt, and are said to be worse than the others after rain. There are also numerous soft patches of oily sand. In dry weather motor lorries have done this journey with some trouble; after rain wheeled transport would find difficulty, and could probably not count on doing more than 8-10 m. per day. After rain transport of all kinds and men or horses would find it difficult to do more than short marches. There are practically no supplies. The few villages met with lie within 16 m, of Ahwaz, but produce nothing worth calculating on. Arab encampments during the winter, if met with, might produce some cattle and sheep. Water is obtainable from the Karun Eiver. Between Ali ibn el-Husein and Kut Abdallah the track followed runs for 26 m. over waterless country accompanied by the pipe-line; this would be avoided by following the river more closely, thus lengthening the journey by 12-15 m. There is no grazing except after rain, and then only in very limited quantity. Fuel is obtainable from brushwood which grows along the bank of the river, but the supply is rapidly diminishing. Miles from Moham- mareh 0 8 Mohammareh. The route starts on the 1. bank of the Karun, immediately above the point where the Bahman Shir branches off. The latter is unfordable at all times of the year. Travellers usually cross to or from r. bank of the Karun at Marid, and begin or conclude their use of this route at that point. Marid village, stream and ferry. When the water is low (i. e. between May and October) the Marid is fordable, though the bottom is always muddy. After the rains Uave begun (i. e. any time between November and March) the Marid is often unfordable, and must then be crossed by a ferry, the animals being swum over. The best place for the erection of a bridge or for the passage by ferry is within 200 yds. of the Karun ; farther down the stream gradually becomes a marsh, and another obstacle in the shape of the Fellahlyeh Canal would have to be crossed. The width of the channel is 40 ft., but the amount filled with water varies according to the season of the year.

This route follows the E. bank of the Karun to Band-i-Qir. This part of the road is fit for wheeled traffic in dry weather. From Band-i-Qir to Shush tar the route as described below traverses Miyanab Island between the two branches of the KarCln, the Ab-i-Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar. Wheeled traffic might get within 12 miles of Shushtar by this way, and a carriage-road might be easily constructed the whole way. Another route, also described below, follows the course of the Ab-i-Diz to Dizful. The most recent maps mark a route passable for wheels leading to Shushtar E. of the Karun: no details are available: see Introduction to this volume, p. 16. From Shushtar to Dizful there were before the war tracks fit for pack animals: it was believed that a cart-road could be made without difficulty. The chief obstacle before the war was the crossing of the Ab-i-Shatait at Shushtar. In December and January there is often a hoar-frost in the morning. The climate may be found trying on account of great differences of temperature between day and night. The worst months for heat are June, July, and August. The spring climate is pleasant, i218 LAND ROUTES and much cooler than at Mohammareh. Rain seldom falls before December, but may occur in November; the heavy rains fall during the early part of the year. There is a fairly large amount of cultivation along the route, and probably after the harvest large supplies of corn could be collected. Water is from the Karun and, after rain, from pools. The Karun water is always sweet, and although very thick in the first five months of the year, it soon settles. Grazing is plentiful if there has been sufficient rain. Fuel, mainly tamarisk bushes, is very scarce some is obtainable from the Diz River. Large stocks of fuel for the steamboat are to be found at Ahwaz, Band-i-Qir, and Shaleili.

Band-i-Qir, Arab village, 300 inhabitants (so reported some years ago : but the population may have grown as a result of the oil traffic). Supplies fairly plentiful. Large caravanserai which before the war was deserted and semi-ruinous. Opposite Band-i-Qir is a bridge of 8 flat-bottomed boats, each 80 ft. in length and 9 ft. in beam. The roadway is 12 ft. broad, and the bridge is 60 yds. long. The bridge is constructed in two halves, either of which can be removed for the passage of boats. There are high and low approaches to the bridge, which are used in winter and summer respectively. The bridge is used by the Oil Company's carts and motor-cars, and would present no obstacles to artillery.

It runs across level country which is mostly without a settled population, and, as far as Hawizeh, is entirely deserted in summer and autumn even by nomads, owing to the lack of water. There is fine grazing in many places, and fuel can be obtained from scrub. Miles from Basra o Basra. The route leads from the 1. bank of the Shatt el-Arab in a general NNE. direction to Kushk Basrah over a level plain, without wells or pools of drinking water. The ground is water-logged after rain, and in places is slippery and bad going all the year round owing to salt efflorescence. It appears from the map that these difficulties can mostly be avoided by diverging somewhat to the E. of the direct line. Ruins of Haddadiyeh. Knshk Basrah, a large ruined brick building on a mound. Here nomads camp in winter and spring, in which seasons only there are pools of water in the neighbour hood. There are no wells. A track from this point leads to Du'eiji, about 35 m. due S. on the Shatt el-Arab. It is little used. Neither it nor the Basra—HawTzeh track is here distinguishable.

It lies on the S. bank of the Karkeh, which here splits up into a number of small channels and loses itself in the marshes. A narrow strip of marsh, passable for animals in places (e. g. opposite Biseitin), separates the river from the desert which extends northwards to the foot of the hills. There is mashhuf traffic from Biseitin through the marshes to the Tigris and up-stream on the Karkeh to Kut Seyyid e Ali (see Route 8 a, m. 81|-). From Biseitin it is possible to reach the Duweirij River by land, following a track which thence leads to the Puslit-i-Kuh. Other tracks lead across the tract of land between the Duweirij and the Karkeh, but they are all unsafe and very little used, and are also waterless for the greater part of the year.

To the north of the route lies a large lihor (Khor Sanaf), which fromROUTES 7, 8 a 227 about m. 6-7 gradually approaches the canal till at a point W. of Khir 'Ubeid (see m. 15^) the 1. bank practically disappears, at least in flood season. It was reported in June 1915 that there should be no difficulty for guns and wheeled vehicles in marching along the 1. bank of the canal as far as m. 15|-, though the banks of some branch-canals needed ramping. Beyond m. 18-| to the neighbourhood of Biseitin (m. 56-|) there are no particulars available as to the route except such as can be gathered from recent maps : the track here runs over desert with marsh on its r.

From m. 86J to m. 104^ the open desert between the Karkeh and Karun is traversed. The going on the alluvial desert soil is probably very heavy in wet weather. On the section of the route between Biseitin and the Ahwaz water is good and plentiful from the Karkeh, but is scarce between the Karkeh and the Karun. Camel-thorn grazing is to be obtained en route. Brushwood for fuel grows on some of the sand-hill ranges near the track, and round Kut el-Hawashim. Some supplies (chiefly rice) can be obtained from the neighbourhood of Biseitin and Khafajiyeh.

Track continues about SE., on the edge of the desert, at some distance from the river, which is separated from it by marshy ground and canals difficult for mules and horses. The southern bank of the Karkeh is here much cut up by canals. Khafajiyeh on S. bank of Karkeh, a large village with several mud huts and some hundreds of reed dwellings. Eesources estimated at 1,000 buffaloes, 300 cattle, 500 sheep, 100 mashhufs. Here caravans in summer cross the river (no details as to crossing), and proceed along the S. bank, crossing numerous canals with minimum summer depth of 4 ft. In winter and spring it is neces sary to keep on the N. side of the river as far as Kut Seyyid Ali, or possibly Kut Nahr Hashim (Illah). See under m. 86^. Kut Seyyid 5 Ali on N. side of Karkeh Eiver.

It fords the Diz one mile below the town. It then proceeds to Dtibandar (5 m.) on the r. bank of the Bala Kud, a stream with a broad bed but very little water even in spring, seldom unfordable. From Dubandar the route runs by Seyyid Ahmed to Shush. (18 m.). Another route to Shush is that described in 7, m. 147-127, 10 13 19 To m. 10 track runs over an open plain, crossing numerous irrigation channels by brick culverts. Track is good, but, as the culverts are narrow, it is not suitable for wheeled transport. Jibar village. From here the track descends to low ground forming the bed of the Diz river, and passes through a swampy tract. Here it crosses numerous streams and water-cuts by flimsy wooden bridges. The track is often difficult to find. Ford the Diz river at the village of Seyyid Mohammed which stands on the r. bank. The ford at 1. w. is about 300 yds. wide and 2 ft. deep. The current is not swift, approaches are easy, and the bottom is firm sand. In spring and after heavy rain the ford does not exist. There are no JceleJcs nor boats here, but these may be obtained from Dizful. From Seyyid Mohammed to Shush track lies over open country and crosses several irrigation channels. It is good except after rain. Shush. Good drinking water from the Shur stream at Shush. Milk plentiful: barley in small quantities only : hlmsa, about 1,000 shalifs (large sacks). Wood plentiful. Stored in the castle at Shush in January 1916 were all materials for a mile of Decauville railway, besides 1,000 picks and 1,000 shovels. Prom Shush to Merkez el-Halfayeh a better route for a large force than that described in detail below is said to be as follows :— Ford the Karkeh as in detailed itinerary below. Thence to Dosalak (16 m. from Shush) : road practicable for all arms. Good and plentiful water at Dosalak: ho supplies. From Dosalak to Fukha on 1. bank of Dnweirij River (41 m. from Shush) road practicable for all arms. Good water at Fukha from the river : no supplies.

From r. bank of the Karkeh turn S. for 3 m., keeping parallel with and close to the river. Turn SW., over open rolling downs. Track is difficult to find here, and a guide is necessary. Cross Abu Salabekh nullah, which holds water in the spring only. The ground is marshy from here to Khezar. Cross Ghashab nullah. Eamping would be needed here for wheels. The nullah always contains water, which is rather brackish. Khezar, a grazing ground for camels : no village, and no supplies. Water from numerous wells (about 30 in all). It is found at about 6 ft. from the surface : more wells could easily be sunk. There are no appliances for draw ing water. Grazing for horses, &amp;c., can be obtained in the neighbourhood (even in January) from patches of dhol) grass. From Khezar to Shatt el-Aghal the general direction is W. by S. The road is suitable for all arms, but see under m. 44. No villages nor supplies. Cross open plain. Eeach pass through the Mushtak (Abu Zarub) hills, which here run roughly NW.-SE. Eoad here crosses a few sand-hills. The rise is very slight and gradual, but at 1 m. to either side of the track the hills rise to about 400 ft. They are much broken in places. Against the western slopes of the hills, about 1 m. due S. of the track, well and spring named Umm el-Hayal. giving drinkable though slightly brackish water. Cross a nullah, which does not form an obstacle. Track runs alongside nullah for about ^ m. Ublilut pools.

Track runs in a general W. direction for 5^ m. over an open undulating plain. The Jebel Fakka lies about NW. by W. (nearly 300°) from here. Direction changes to WSW. to m. 65^-. The ground now drops to a lower level and crosses a flat plain, which is covered with tamarisk jungle for the first 3 m., and after that is quite bare. Here and there small nullahs and water-cuts are crossed. Slight ramping of the nullah banks would be needed for wheels. Direction changes to SW. by S., to m. 72. Duweirij Eiver. Cross by ford. The river-bed is nearly 1 m. in breadth from bank to bank. Most of it is occu pied with shallow swamp. The bottom is firm, but very uneven and difficult going for laden mules. The stream is near the r. (S.) bank, and here the water deepens. In January 1916 the depth in the stream was 4^ ft., in consequence of recent heavy rain. The river is reported to be much shallower in 1. w. The crossing of the Duweirij swamp and stream would be practicable for all arms, but difficult for wheels. From the Duweirij the track to Merkez el-Halfayeh goes S. by E. (It would appear that 3 or 4 m. from Merkez this route crosses Boute 8 a.)

The southern part of this marshy tract is known as the Khor Yazreh, the northern as the Khor Shaureh. In July 1916, after about two months of decrease, the Khor Yazreh was ^ m. wide and 7 in. deep, but owing to its sticky bottom was still impassable to cavalry: in the second week of August, however, it offered no obstruction to cavalry. The Khor Shaureh in July was 2,000 yds. wide and 11 in. deep, apparently at a few miles distance from the river: its bottom was sufficiently firm to allow the passage of cavalry. The N. branch of the Kharkareh is said to run into the Khor Shaureh, On a map (T. C. 43) dated July 1, 1916, a route is marked running from a point on the 1. bank of the Tigris about 5 m. below Kumeit across the Khor Shaureh by the Besha Mound (about m. 20) to Kuweit (about m. 41 from the Tigris), where the Tyb River debouches from the hills. On Kuweit see below. (ii) Prom the Tigris between Kumeit and 'Ali el-Gharbi — On this stretch of the river the floods on the 1. bank dry more quickly than those between Amara and Kumeit. At the end of June the 1. bank was here reported to be completely dry, and, so far as regards the ground, troops and transport could move anywhere from the river to the Persian hills. Mudalil—Deh Luran Kuweit The route apparently starts from the 1. bank opposite Mudalll tract (see Boute III B, m. 40ij. As far as Kuweit (m. 35) the ground in June was passable throughout for light carts, but no water was to be found between the Tigris and Kuweit. Arabs cannot live in this region during the hot weather. At Kuweit water is plentiful from the Tyb, but is very bad and brackish: better water from tributaries of the Tyb is to be found in the hills beyond. A hundred men might obtain supplies at Kuweit for a few days. The road from Kuweit to Deh Luran would need some preparation for carts. Water apparently plentiful. On Deh Luran see 10 a, m. 79-80|.EOUTES 8 c, d 23e5 ROUTE 8 d f ALI EL-GHARBI—DEH LUEAN Via K uweit Authorities: —Force 'D' Eoute Eeports and other information of June, July, and August, 1916. The account given below of the two routes from e Ali el-Gharbi to the Tyb near Kuweit describes their condition in July 1916. The ground traversed is generally level, but is said to be very deceptive, having folds where men could hide. The dry river-beds mentioned in Alternative (ii) would prove obstacles in the rains. The defile of the Tyb above Kuweit is passable for infantry, cavalry, and pack-mules in the 1. w. season. In flood time the whole bed is completely covered with water, and the defile is impassable even for men going singly on foot. There is apparently no other route practi cable for troops through the hills in that neighbourhood. On Alternative (i) between the Tigris and the Tyb river there is no water fit to be drunk in any quantity. On Alternative (ii) good water is said to be obtainable in the rainy season (December-March) in the Kuweiseh river-bed. The Tyb at Kuweit could not be drunk by men for more than two days together, except perhaps in the rainy season, when it is said that it might be drunk for a longer period without ill effects, or unless wells were sunk near the river. It is said that better water is to be obtained in the hills from tributaries of the Tyb. On both routes to Kuweit grazing was found all the way in July, except at small bare patches here and there. Brushwood for fuel is not obtainable until the Tyb is reached. No supplies en route. The grazing near the river is poor. Wood is plentiful from the brushwood in the river-bed : sticks 3 in. in diameter can be obtained. Kuweit is a ruined village, now merely a mound, about ^ m. from the hills. There is good grazing there, but no wood nor water. The Tyb River, known also in its upper reaches as the Maimah Kiver, rises in the interior of Pusht-i-Kuh, and has its sources in some large springs 1 m. W. of Maimah village, which is 54 m. in a direct line from Bedrah on a bearing of ENE. (72°). After traversing the Deh Luran plain the Tyb finds its way through the Pusht-i-Kuh foot-hills, and thence debouches on to the Mesopo- tamian plain. From the neighbourhood of Kuweit it proceeds in a southerly direction, forming a marsh in the plain, and coming to within a few miles of Amara. Short of that place the marsh turns E., and the waters of the Tyb236 LAND ROUTES flow into the Musharreh Canal about 1 m. W. of Khir 'Ubeid (see Route 8 a m. 15-16). , At its source and in its upper reaches the water of the Tyb, or Maimah is sweet and of good quality. In its passage through the foot-hills it becomes impregnated with sulphurous matter, with the result described above. Normally the river is a clear-running stream containing a large number of fish.

The route lies over an open plain passable for all arms (July) : in places there are patches of salt petre crust which would be heavy going for wheeled transport. Dahela, a group of eight hillocks about 10 ft. high. The wells are 50 yds. E. of the most easterly hillock. In July 1916 there were 10 dry holes, one usable well about 5 ft. square with water 4 ft. 6 in. deep, and another well with very dirty brown water. Kough water-troughs have been made round the wells. There are also three other wells, with water in July, i m. to W. The water at Dahela is very sulphurous : it cannot be drunk in any quantity. Horses will drink it.

The stream here runs roughly S. from the hills, which are about 1 m. distant. The water-course is about 20 ft. below the surrounding country, and is about 100 yds. wide. It is covered up to the hot weather channel with brushwood about 8 ft. high. In July the stream was found to be about 40 yds. wide, with an average depth in the middle of 2^ ft., and a mean speed of m. p. h. The bottom is firm, with smooth pebbles and stones.KOUTE 8 d 237 The water in the low season has a full dose of purgative salts in each gallon. Chemical analysis in August 1916 proved that the water then, even after treatment by the lime process (which made a slight improvement), could probably not be drunk by men for more than two days together. For a longer period, wells should be dug 3-10 ft. deep, 10-15 yds. from river's edge: water fresh at first, becoming brackish gradually. (ii) Northern Koute to Kuweit, via Qaea Tepeh (36^ m.)

Hereabouts a dry water-course is crossed running from NW. to SE. Qara Tepeh, a conspicuous hill about 50 ft. high and 100 yds. in diameter. There are some sangars on it and traces of camps near it. There are 12 wells, about ^ m. N. of the hill. Of these two contained water in July 1916: the water was then very disagreeable and quite undrinkable. From here the bearing to Abu Ghoreib is SE. by E.

The hills on either side are very steep and broken, running to a height of 500-700 ft. above the river-bed. They are of sandstone of terra-cotta colour. In the low season the river winds from bank to bank leaving most of the bed dry. The dry part is covered with water-worn pebbles and small boulders, and con tains a considerable amount of low scrub. On account of its windings the stream has to be often forded. In the flood season the whole bed is filled, and the defile is impassable even for men going singly on foot. Reach the Deh Luran plain.

For the first part of their route, N. of eh Bala, see Route 9. The details are mainly from Feisia, vol. iii, no. 103 ; they are said to have been borne out by the Russians experience. The r.oad in the hills is passable for pack- transport only and is sometimes difficult for that. Light snow was met with in May near Marbarreh (see under m. 85|).

The neighbourhood, which is irrigated from the Wadi (Ab-i-Changulak or Changuleh), was long in dispute between the Vali of Fusht-i-Kuh and the Turks. In 1914 the Boundary Commission awarded it to the Turks, deciding that the frontier should pass just above the Shehabi Head, where the irrigation channels take off from the river (see below, p. 244). Since the beginning of the war, however, the Vali has built a new fort near the ruins of Bagh-i-Shahl in order to re-assert his claim. Of the two alternative routes given below, the first (eastern), Seyyid Mohammed, is the better going. It is passable for all arms mes. ii Q242 LAND ROUTES at all seasons, except in the first 3 m.. where the ground is KnKU r flood in the high-water season if the Tigris are brell; Heavy ram would greatly impede wheeled traffic. The second (western) route through the belt of scrub on the 1 bank of the Wadi (Lower Ab-i-Changulak) is heavier and rougher Fatches of soft soil are numerous, but could be avoided. This routp is apparently not impassable for guns and carts. wa f er ' cliannels met with on bot h routes are supplied from the Wadi, and are wet or dry at the will of the inhabitants. Most of them apparently derive their water from the Shehabi Head above Bagh-i-Shaln (see p. 244). Chitab's channel, however, takes off 4 miles below Mohammed ibn Jabar (see Alternative (ii), m. 13). When the channels are wet, they would be serious obstacles for cavalry. They are often bordered by high reeds affording good cover from view Water is available only from the Wadi and its channels. It is all o same quality and brackish, but seems to improve with keeping and m the cool of the day. Horses drink it readily.

It stands inside a rectangular enclosure, 30 yds. by 15 yds., on high ground overlooking the country to NE. and W. There are traces of huts near it, but no one lives there now. General direction to Bagh-i-Shahl, N. N. of the shrine the ground breaks suddenly into a nullah 100-800 yds. broad with banks of varying steepness 8-10 ft. high. Koute follows this nullah for about 1 m. The nullah here, or a little farther on, merges into an open plain dotted about with bushes generally about 18 in. high and 4-5 ft. apart: no trees. Cross slight depression running NE.-SW., containing many patches of grass. A dry water-channel, with tall green rushes, was crossed here : it had evidently been recently flooded. Nahr Seyyid Mohammed, marked by green rushes 6 ft. high which make it conspicuous and block the view beyond. In September it was found to contain a good flow of water 2-3 ft. broad and 1 ft. deep. Excavated earth alongside made watering difficult except at breaks here and there. Good dhob grass is plentiful along this stream. The channel would delay cavalry. Bushes decrease, till in the neighbourhood of Bagh-i-Shahl the ground is quite bare. Bagh-i-Shahi ruins, covering an area of about 600 yds. by 400 yds. Apart from the Ziyaret Kaka Ali, a domeless shrine in the western part of the ruins, only a few broken mud walls remain. A track to Changulak leads up the 1. bank of the Wadi (see p. 239). Route 10 c crosses here. The Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh's fort lies 2 m. to NE. (ENE. ?) of Bagh-i-Shahl. It was built since the beginning of the war. It is about 70 yds. square, with walls 15 ft. high and an imposing gateway. Some 25 Arab shelters are clustered along its NE. side, apparently for the garrison and its women and children. q 2244 LAND ROUTES Miles from Sheikh Sa r ad o 13 The Shehabi Head on the Wadi River is about 4 m. from Bagh-i- Shahi. At m. 1 the ends of six raised irrigation channels running from the N., are passed: one working, with a 10-ft. fall of water. The others in fair repair, and their water-wheels could probably be put into working order without much difficulty. Beyond this point four channels are crossed, 2-3 ft. wide and 2 ft! deep : two contained a fast-running stream in September. The country is open and bare. At m. 4 the Shehabi Head is reached. Here the Wadi runs in several streams down an open water-course of round stones 2-3 in. in diameter. The water-course has no banks, and is about 800 yds. broad. There are three groups of streams, each split up into minor channels. These were 6-25 ft. broad and up to 18 in. deep in September. The eastern and western groups of streams are led off into side channels, as shown in I.D. map 2 L, passing E. and W. of Bagh-i-Shahi. The water in the Wadi is all clear, but distinctly brackish. A conspicuous patch of brushwood, j m. square, with bushes 8-5 ft. high on the r. bank of the Wadi is visible from far off. In the distance both it and one or two other patches in the neighbour hood have the appearance of trees along the foot of the hills. The country between the Shehabi Head and the Vali's fort (8 m. distant) is bare and open, and intersected by five channels. The last mile towards the fort is covered with round stones 2-8 ft. in diameter lying about 6 in.-l ft. apart. (ii) Via M ohammed ibn J abae, to the V ali of P usht-i -K uh's F okt Sheikh Sa ad.

A con siderable amount of half-buried was found here in September 1916. The 1. bank of the Wadi is here a 20-ft. cliff with two ramps cut down to the water. The opposite bank is not so steep, but would need ramping even for pack-animals, and it would take 4 hours' work by 200 men to make it fit for guns. The banks are about 60 yds. apart; the stream was 20-30 yds. wide and 1-2 ft. deep, with a flow of 2-3 m. p. b., in September, The water is very clear but brackish: it has caused a crust of white salt to form along the banks. The brackish taste was found to be less noticeable when the water was cold. The Arabs said that its quality was better than that of the Tyb water. The authority says,' I personally drank about three water- bottles full and suffered no ill effects, though the taste in the warmth of the afternoon was distinctly unpleasant'. Horses drank it readily. General direction to m. 26f, NE. (The white dome of Seyyid Mohammed is visible from here to Bagh-i-Shahl.) The route diverges from the Wadi, still passing through bushes and brushwood, which, however, decrease in density and height. The going is rough. Patches of soft soil which can be avoided. The country is irrigated from the Nahr Ganjija and its offshoots running in a general SW. direction. Their course is generally marked by a line of high green reeds or bushes and grass. Cross an offshoot of the Nahr Ganjija (dry in September). Cross the ITahr Ganjija, reed-filled channel, dry in September. Direction changes to ENE. The country is still dotted with bushes, 1-3 ft. in height. Between this point and m. 28 there are still patches of soft hummocky soil, very difficult for wheels. From m. 28 to m. 29, though these patches are apparently no longer found, the ground is rough, giving the appearance of plough, and full of saltpetre. From this point the country is open loamy plain with a few bushes. Pass Bagh -i -Shahi ruins. Ford the XTahr Seyyid Mohammed (see route (i), m. 24).

From Zorbatiyeh onwards only a general account of the character of the various stages is given here. This road is reported to be well frequented in spite of its difficulties. It is suitable for mule and donkey transport only. Guns can pass as far as Zorbatiyeh (m. 61^). Donkeys seem to be the transport most used by the natives on the route. From Huseiniyeh onwards the road traverses a succession of very difficult defiles and passes. In the spring, when the rivers are in flood, the road is probably closed in several places.EOUTES 8g, 9 247 Some supplies are usually available at the villages on the route, but probably in small quantities only. Water is found throughout, but up to Deh Bala is often brackish. Grazing was found to be good in May 1916 beyond Deh Bala. Fuel is obtainable in the hills, but is generally scarce at the halting-places. In the hills the climate is pleasant in August, the hottest time of year. Towards the end of October the rainy season begins, and continues for about a month. Then snow sets in and remains on the ground for 2^-8 months.

Two authorities, who traversed this stage in August 1888 and October 1897 respectively, seem to have followed somewhat different lines. The authority of 1897 reported his route passable for guns. The soil is a rich alluvial clay cut up with the remains of old canals, and for the first few miles is covered on both sides of the road with low vegetation, including grass. The route crosses the marshy belt at the W. end of the Khor Suweiklyeh ; for this marsh see note at end of route. Desert with scanty herbage. Herbage begins to improve. From this point onwards a number of irrigation canals are crossed: in August a few held water, though the majority were dry: in October all were dry. Jessan (alt. 98 ft.), a town of about 400 houses administered by a Mudir. Its population is largely Kurdish. It is situated on a low mound, with a number of date-gardens adjoining it. Water in abundance from a canal, described as brackish, though drinkable. Numerous flocks have been seen grazing in the surrounding plain. Troops can encamp anywhere in the vicinity. Want of water and supplies makes Jessan the first stage for travellers on this route. From Jessan the route takes a general NNE. direction to Bedrah across a level plain. The road is good, and passable for guns. Jessan date-gardens end. Pass an irrigation stream: water plentiful; several small irrigation channels are crossed by small wooden or concrete bridges.

The place is surrounded by date and orange gardens extending for 2 m. from either bank, and surrounded by a mud wall 15-20 ft. high with watch-towers at intervals. In 1888 the inhabitants were all Shiahs, except the sheikh and his family, who were Sunnis. About 1905 the popu lation of Bedrah was said to be Kurdish. A Turkish zaptieh post of 100 men was stationed here. From Bedrah the route goes in a general ENE. direction to Zorbatiyeh. The road is good, leading over an open level plain.

Cliambeh Valley. Troops can camp anywhere in the valley. Water and firewood plentiful, grazing good. From the Chambeh Valley to Deh Bala (general direction NE.) the road passes through a rocky defile called the Gardan-i-Khurnuk, and is impassable for gung and difficult for horses and laden mules owing to its narrow ness and abrupt ascents of 2-3 ft. over smooth rock. Blasting in about twenty different places, each less than 5 yds. in length, might make it good for laden animals.

In May 1916 a sotnia of Russian Cossacks (110 men with 10 pack- horses) rode from Mahidesht on the Kirmanshah—Baghdad road (vol. iii, Route 28 a, m. 205|) to Palanglr Zailait (see first note at end of this route), and from Palanglr to Charduvar by the route described below, from Routes in vol. iii, no. 104. Between Charduvar and Deh Bala the Russians seem to have followed more or less the route described in Rou vol. iii, no. 94, stage 8. According to Russian officers, the Tang-i-Duarnan' there mentioned is called the Tang-i-Ghunyan. The section of road from this to Deh Bala (about 20 m.) was found very difficult.

For the rest of the Russians' route to Deh Bala see Route 8 e. From Deh Bala to Asyab-i-Musa (general direction NKE. to m. 120|, then E.) the road has to cross a pass (Gardan-i- Akhur Safid, or, at its summit, Gardan-i-Ganbarra; 8,050 ft.) which is impassable for wheels and difficult for pack transport. A gorge at m. 128 might be impassable after heavy rain. Asyab-i-Musa (alt. 4,350 ft.). Supplies very scarce. One water-mill. 10 people of the Tulabi tribe. Nomad tents.

The route between Zailan and Kirmanshah is passable for wheels. Note on the Khoe Suweikiyeh The above route crosses the great belt of marsh which extends S. and SE. from the neighbourhood of Mandali to the district N. of Kut el-Amara (see p. 94), where the Khor Suweikiyeh lies. The Suweikiyeh Lake or Marsh is fed mainly by streams from the Persian hills to the N., but the Tigris water is believed to enter it if hunds break. The main point of breaking entailing this result would be at the head of the Imam Mahdi Canal, 18 m. NW. of Kut. The water of the marsh is slightly brackish but drinkable. The depth at the centre is reported to be 3 ft. (November 1916), as it is also^ near the N. shore, which looks rather steeper than the S. shore in parts. The bottom near the edges is generally firm and walking is comparatively easy. The following details as to the marsh were reported in March- November 1916 :— (a) March 28. The Suweikiyeh flood-level 3 ft. below the level of the Tigris at a point opposite SE. corner of marsh. {b) May 14. The water on the marsh where it is traversed by Route 9 reported to be 1 in. deep. (c) June 13. The Suweikiyeh Marsh reported to extend now very little W. of Shumran. (d) August 10. The E. and W. extremities of the Suweikiyeh Marsh reported to be now only some 2 m. across from N. to S.: width at centre 8 m. This represents a decrease of some 7 m. in width, due largely to the Shamal (which began this year abnormally late, on July 21: see note on S p. 444). As regards the length of the marsh, the W. end was reported to have receded about ' p 1 * eastward since the middle of uly, leaving a dry gap, 2 J m. in width, crossed by Houte 9. W. of this gap, the former lake area was now represented by a collection of separate pools. (e) November 22. No water was yet entering the marsh, the beds of feeders being observed to NE. and NW. of it. The marsh towards Jessan covered an area of about 6 m. by 4 m., but was stillEOUTE 9 253 separated from the Khor Suweiklyeh by a dry gap about 4 m. wide. The level of the Suweiklyeh was considerably higher than that of the Tigris S. and SW. of it. The water in the Dahra Canal stopped about 250 yds. from the Suweiklyeh Lake. As to Boute 9, it may be added that neither of the earlier authorities referred to (August 1888 and October 1897) found any water actually on the route for the first 35 m. In August 1888 a salt-marsh was found, beginning at m. 12 and extending to m. 21, in which animals sank to 6 inches: the Suweiklyeh marshes lay to NE. and still contained water. In October 1897 going became heavy from 18 m. to 19^ m. ' across the Suweiklyeh marshes'. An unpleasant smell was evidence of water lying to W. side of track. Both authorities state that in spring the route is flooded. The breadth of the inun dation area is then apparently about 8 m., and the depth of water 1^-3 ft. One authority states that the flood-water was said to be drinkable.254 LAND EOUTES EOUTE 10 a ZORBATIYEH—DIZFUL (162i m.) Authority :—Routes in Persia, vol. iii, nos. 93 and 91, stages 8-13. A desert route. The road is passable for all arms throughout, but is reported to be practicable only in winter and spring owing to the lack of supplies at other seasons. In October the tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh descend to the plains on the route, bringing with them large flocks and herds. The Indian corn is then ripe and the desert always provides a certain quantity of grass. In February the approach of spring provides the most luxuriant herbage, which dries in the first heat of March and April, during which months the tribes migrate to the hill country, leaving the plain almost deserted throughout the summer. ' In no case should infantry endeavour to follow this section of the route until arrangements for supplies be made with the tribes and the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh ; or if unaccompanied by cavalry, whose services would be absolutely necessary for foraging.' Water is plentiful as far as Qal'ateh, though apparently slightly brackish. From Qal'ateh to Dizful it is procurable throughout except in the tract between the Jik and the Karkeh rivers; it is, however, often impregnated with salt and sulphur. Fuel is probably not available as far as Qal'ateh, and beyond Qal'ateh it is reported to be procurable only from the mountains, generally some miles distant. Forage is abundant in winter and spring. The passage of the Karkeh River from November to May would require special arrangements if the fords were impracticable.

The river-bed contains tamarisk jungle. Tepeh. Patak mound, near Talazi Eiver. Springs of water on S. side. Tamarisk in the river-bed; water of stream slightly brackish. From Tepeh Patak to the Jik, or Jikan River, the general direction is ESE. A wide track runs across level desert, generally grassy, and occasionally traverses broad water- channels (dry in September) running to the Talazi Eiver, which diverges to S. Jik Eiver. Camp room on either bank, or in the sunken river-bed, which is J m. broad, containing tamarisk bushes and a clear stream of fair water. From the Jik to the Karkeh the general direction is E. No water on the route in September 1897. Eoad crosses undulating grassy plain for 4 m., and then traverses broad, level, grassy valley. Pass solitary tomb of Seyyid 'Abbas. This is apparently Imamzadeh Dacha-i-'Abbas. See Northern Eoute, above. From Imamzadeli Dacha-i-*Abbas a road runs to Sliakhet el-Halweh (4 m.), thence to the Karkeh Kiver, fordable for all arms, Sept.- Dec., at Imamzadeh Gha'ib on E. bank (30 m. from Dacha-i-'Abbas) and thence via Shush (34 m.) to Shushtar (80 m.). The road is fit for wheeled transport from Shakhet el-Halweh onwards, except at the crossing of the Shur River (girth deep in December) 1| m. W. of Shush. Water is plentiful from the same point. Fuel and fodder fair to good. Eoad enters low, bare hills. Passing ruined tomb, road enters broken ground. Farther on, some broad water-courses are crossed ; dry in Sep tember. Level sandy ground. Kuins and canal mounds at Kut. Karkeh Eiver. Camp room ample; grass and tamarisk fuel from river banks. From October to April camps of Sagwand Lurs; but here, as elsewhere on the route, there are no inhabitants in summer. Wheat crops ripen in spring. From the Karkeh to Dizftil the general direction is E. Cross the Karkeh Eiver. The fords are shifting and dangerous, and guides are required. [N.B.

There is a better ford than Pa-i-Pul 4 m. down, called Aivan-i-Karkeh, 3 ft. 6 in. deep, and another 2 m. lower.] The river divides into three arms, separated by tamarisk- covered islands ; the banks are low and pebbly, the bed is gravel and stones. In September 1897 the right arm was 50 yds. wide, and girth deep ; the centre arm was 50 yds. wide, and up to the point of a horse's shoulders, with a swift and dangerous current; the left arm was 100 yds. wide, girth deep for a short distance, then shallow. The course taken by the water has, however, probably altered considerably since 1897. The crossing is easy only in spring and autumn, and even then the river would require bridging for artillery. On the farther side of the Karkeh the road crosses cultivated lands and many irrigation channels, the crossings of which are deep and swampy. Cross a deep-cut, difficult canal, 30 ft. broad and girth deep. Kurdish camp of 500 tents was pitched here in 1897. Cross the Bala Rud, dry in summer, and rarely unfordable.

From Umm Chir to Mandali the route on which notes are given below was followed by the British Delegation to the Turco-Persian Boundary Commission in March 1914. The caravan of the British Delegation numbered about 150 men with mule transport. The Russian, Persian, and Turkish Delegations followed more or less the same line. The Russian and Persian caravans were each somewhat smaller than the British, and the Turkish numbered 50^ men. The caravans were provisioned from the Tigris, supplies being collected at Amara,'Ali el-Gharbi, Kut, and Baghdad.

Early in March this river was found, when first reached, to be a fast-flowing stream, 50- 60 yds. broad and 5 ft. deep at the ford. It flowed at a level far below the desert beneath precipitous mud cliffs. Heavy rain lasting for a day and a night brought the water to the level of the surrounding plain. This flood very appreciably altered the course of the river. According to recent information (1916) the Duweirij, after leaving the foot-hills, turns somewhat N. of W., and flows into the Khor Malih, the eastern border of which is about 17 m. W. of the point where the river leaves the hills. This Ichor, which is largely open water, con nects with the Khor Sanaf, which lies N. of, and adjoining, the Musharreh Canal. Camp a few m. from Shahriz ruin-mounds about 27 m. short of the Tyb Eiver. Ford the Tyb Eiver where it pierces by a deep gorge through the lowest foot-hills of the mountains. These foot-hills are of red clay much broken by the action of the water. Beyond the river where it was forded there is good camping-ground on broad, terraced slopes, with grass in spring: but the water of the Tyb is not good for drinking purposes, being described as ' an exceedingly potent solution of Epsom salts Next camp at Qara (Qal'ah ?) Tepeh, a huge, solitary mound in flat desert. At its foot are half a dozen shallow wells, with bad, dirty water, full of tadpoles. Chift Darr camp, in desert a little nearer the hills than at Qara Tepeh. In March there was here a small stream of good, clear water between high cliffs. This probably dried a few weeks later in the year. Camp at ruins of Bagh-i -Shahl on Shanguleh Eiver. Euins of mud-built aqueducts and water-mills.

At the foot of the cliff there is a strip of very broken ground 2-3 m. broad, a confused jumble of little hills and hollows. The hills are high enough to shut out all view, and it is easy for a caravan to lose its bearings in this ground. From the summit of the cliff wide view towards mountains ahead. The intervening country is irrigated by two streams which issue from the mountains some distance apart and unite in the plain. In the middle of the plain is the white tomb of Seyyid Hasan which gives its name to the lands. Oasis of Bedrah visible on W. horizon (see 9, m. 54). Camp at tomb of Seyyid Hasan. Bedrah lies some 15-20 m. to W.; road runs thither from Seyyid Hasan over stony and sandy plain. Zorbatiyeli. See Moute 9, m. 61^. From here, three days' march to Mandali over a plain, which after heavy rain becomes very bad going : in wet weather the streams become flooded. In March 1914 one was crossed which was bordered by a strip of bog on either bank, and several mules had to be unloaded before they could cross. At the end of November 1916, however, all streams looked fordable. The distances are very uncertain from here. A track joins from Bedrah, 5 m. S. (For route from Kut el-Amara see Route 9, m. 0-54.) There are, however, two tracks from Bedrah to the Tursakh (m. 236 below), where the more westerly of the two apparently ends. Hnshayma. Large brackish stream. Tursakh stream ; water plentiful, but brackish and hardly drinkable. Talkh stream, brackish. This is believed to join the Tursakh lower down. Kazauieh, and .

Via Ab-i-Saed Authority : — Routes in Persia, Corrections to (1914), no. 88 and Alternatives A and B. This route makes somewhat of a detour to the W., but keeps E. of the Kashgan river. The detour can be somewhat shortened if between the Tirada valley and Ab-i-Sard the old route by Ser-i-Gul is taken (for description of this alternative see under m. 44 below). The main route issues on to the Khurramabad plain at Shah-in-Shah, but branch tracks from it seem to lead on to that plain farther E., near Kurageh (see alternative routes given under m. 80, m. 121, m. 130). The main route has been called the easiest between Dizful and Khurramabad, but it seems possible that the route which passes W. of the Kashgan by Pul-i-Madian Eud (see lib) may be somewhat better. For some years the route by Ab-i-Sard has been closed to caravans owing to the prevailing anarchy, and has been used only by nomad tribes in their migrations. In 1884 the following estimate was made of the possibilities of cart-road construction on the main route by Ab-i-Sard (it will be noticed that in this estimate the total distance is made 5 m. longer than in the description given below): 57 m. good and level: only removal of loose stones needed. 60 m. fair, needed to be widened and cleared of stones. 40 m. bad, needing to be widened and zigzags to be constructed in places. The cost in 1884 was estimated at Ks. 27,140: in 1911, how ever, the work was considered more difficult, and the cost was put at about £10,000. The chief obstacles are the Dum-i-Chul pass (see under m. 73), the Tang-i-Pinawar (see under m. 83), and the Dalich pass (see under m. 106|). The route rises to heights of 3,000 to 6,000 ft. from the Dum-i- Chul pass onwards, and in winter it is covered with snow in places, but is not impassable for long though the cold is bitter. Heavy rains or snowfall occur from November to April. In summer the heat is very great as far as Dum-i-Chul, scarcely less so than on the Arabistan plain.262 LAND EOUTES Water is generally plentiful and good from streams, but the Ab-i-Lailum (m. 66) and the Ab-i-Fanl (m. 73) are bitter in summer, and the supply is scanty at Chul. Grazing for mules and horses is good and abundant, especially in the early summer months. Fuel is very scarce as far as Badamak (m. 103), though enough for a small party can be got at Chul (m. 80). From Badamak onwards fuel is plentiful. No supplies except from nomads, and these as a rule cannot supply barley, or spare more than enough bread to last a small party for a few days. Mule-market at Dizful (see p. 490). Numerous mules, mares, bullocks, and donkeys are in the hands of the nomad tribes, who, however, sell only a few mules now and then. The country up to m. 12 (Du Kuh) belongs to the Sagwand ; thence to near m. 37 (Qal'ah Riza) is Qalawand territory; from Qal'ah Eiza to Dum-i-Chul, about m. 75-80, the country belongs to the Baharwand and Kurd 'Aliwand sections of the Dirakwand. From the Dum-i-Chul to the Shurab valley the country is occupied partly by Dirakwand, partly by Judeki. The main route described below, and the alternative Tirada valley—Ab-i-Sard Ser-i-Gul— are used by Baharwand and Kurd 'Aliwand in their migrations between their summer and winter quarters.

Pass two ancient waterworks (Du Hanzau), 1 m. from the Bala Eud. The plain becomes more stony and rises gently. Track crosses many dry water-courses. A few miles to W. of it is a detached hill called Qal'ah Qasim. Here direct road to Qal'ah Eiza (see m. 37 below) diverges to NW., crossing the Bala Eud and running by Var-i- Zard, Cham-i-Chakal, Ab-i-Gilal-i-Murt, Kul-i-Nai, and Papi Murdeh.

Then over Tushmal hills; cross a succession of difficult ridges and ravines. Koad improves and rises gradually, past Bidrubeh plain, through intricate and rocky hills. The streams crossed are dry, or almost dry, during summer. The head of the Qal'ah Eiza valley is reached. Descend by stony paths. ilah Briza (alt. 1,550 ft.): ruined khan and T. O. In the cold weather the valley is occupied by the Bahar- wand tribe. There is a good camping-ground in the valley of Kul Huni, m. S. of the khan, from which it is hidden by low hills. Water from stream, grazing good, fuel scarce: no supplies except from nomads. General direction to Jauzar, NW. Cross the stony Kiza plain, 4x 1^ m., cultivated in places: keep to S. side of low liills._ Cross the Ab-i-Zal. The river flows in a ravine 60 ft. deep : the drop of the banks to the stream is another 30 ft. The approaches on either side are stony and bad. There is a brick bridge of 20 ft. span in need of repair, the position of which is indicated by two stone and gyp sum pillars on either side. The fords above and below the bridge are difficult. The remains of several bridges are to be seen in the neighbourhood. Beyond the river, cross stony slopes. Gypsum hills are reached. Stony valley of the Ab-i-Tirada; the camping-ground on E. bank is Qabr-i-Qasim, that on W. bank is Qafilaja. (The old graded track crossed the Ab-i-Tirada, by a wooden bridge, where it flows through a ravine only 10 ft. broad at top.)264 LAND ROUTES Miles from Dizfal 45 In summer when water is scarce at Jauzar (m. 56) it is best to make a halt in this valley, and thence proceed to Darreh Khazineh (see under m. 56), where water is easily obtainable from the Saidmarreh, rather than camp at Jauzar. From here a route to the Dalich passes, much more direct than that by Valmian described below, goes by Ser-i-Gul. It used to be the principal commercial route between Dizful and Khurramabad, and some improvements were made on it by the Persian authorities (e.g. blasting). The anarchy prevailing in the country has caused it to fall more and more into disuse : yet it was said in 1911 to be still preferred, 4 bad though it isby caravans and nomads. The passes are occasionally blocked by snow in winter for a few weeks at a time. Water is plentiful, except between the Kialan and Dalich ranges, where it is bitter, though generally drinkable. Fuel is very scarce. No supplies. Miles from Dizf al 44 50 60 66 69 Ab-i-Tirada valley. Track diverges to r. from the Valmian route, going NNW. It passes over gypsum and sand stone hills, and there are quantities of loose stones which make going very bad. Birinjzar, in territory occupied by the Dirakwand. Water from stream. Good grazing. Scanty fuel. General direction N. to Ser-i-Gul. Before the beginning of the ascent over the Kialan Kuh a grotto, containing a spring of water, is passed on r. of road. The ascent to the pass over the Kialan Kuh (4,715 ft.) is steep and difficult. The road has been improved by blasting near the summit. The descent on the northern side is difficult and slippery. (This pass, it is said, would be easy to improve.) From the foot of the descent to Ser-i-Gul the going is better. Ser-i-G-ul. Water bitter, though drinkable. ^ It is advisable to take drinking-water from Birinjzar.' General direction to Mishwand, NW. Eoad runs over stony spurs. It is bad and stony, but could be improved into a good mule road by clearing away the stones. Before reaching the Buk-i-Buland, apparently the last of these spurs, there is water, which, though bitter in summer, is always drinkable. Mishwand, a grazing district of low gypsum hills. (Map I.D., sheet 9 C, places Mishwand south of the Buk-i- Buland.) Dalich pass (Dalich Buzurg ? See rn. 106| below). Cross gypsum ridge and descend to the valley of Dar-i- Zarab.

Ascend steep slope. The Pul-i-Tang on the Saidmarreh here lies 1 m. due S. The river there contracts to 5-6 yds., and is bridged by a single arch. A track diverges here up S. bank of river. Eoad is now stony, but easy, over the slopes of the Kebir Euh, into which the Saidmarreh has cut a deep and impassable tang, 1 m. S. of road. Pass Shah Ahmed Kuchikeh, shrine (alt. 1,950 ft.). Enter southern plain of Jauzar, small and grassy. Camp in Jauzar (alt. 1,850 ft.). Water is rather bitter in the southern plain, and scarce in summer, but can be obtained from the Saidmarreh by a difficult pathway from the second (northern) plain of Jauzar (see m. 44 above). From here the general direction to the Ab-i-Fanl is NW. Down the Jauzar stream to Darreh Khazineh, where the level of the Saidmarreh is reached, just where it enters the gorge at the southern end of which is the Pul-i-Tang. This is a good halting- place. Proceed over easy ground. Cross stream with difficult approaches. Cross another stream with difficult approaches. Ab-i-Lailnm is crossed ^ m. above its junction with the Saidmarreh. The bed of the stream is full of boulders, but easy to cross. Here a track diverges to r. through the Tang-i-Lailum to the Dalich pass (see under m. 106|). Proceeding, keep near the Saidmarreh. Cross difficult spur. Ab-i-Pani (alt. 1,550 ft.), easy to cross. Camping-grounds anywhere near the stream: a good place is 1 m. W. of the mouth of the Tang-i-Fanl, near a good clear spring at the bottom of some foot-hills. The water of the Ab-i-Fanl is rather bitter, that of the Saidmarreh is good. Grazing is good, fuel is scarce.266 LAND ROUTES Miles from Dizful A track branches off here continuing along the Saidmarreh to the Kashgan and up that stream to Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar. See Route 11 b (i), note under m. 0. General direction to Valmian, N. Follow stony path among foot-hills, skirting a small lake. Cross the end of the Kialan range (here known as Du Farush) at a point called Dum-i-Clml (alt. 3,200 ft.). The sides of the mountain are at a slope of 30°. A foot path crosses at an altitude of 3,500 ft. From the top of the Dum-i-Chul, or possibly from the foot of the ascent, Boute 11 b (i) diverges to 1., leading to Khur- rarnabad by Pul-i-Madian Eud. The descent is steep. The Cliul plain is reached near masonry tomb. There are here some small springs of sweet water at the foot ol: limestone hills, and a large pond 1 m. NW. From here an authority in 1904 followed a little-used hill-track to Khurramabad which runs at first to W. and then to E. of the main track described below. It is not certain where it crosses the main track : it apparently does so in the neighbourhood either of the Taiyil or of the Shiirab stream (m. 132 or m. 135 of main route). Proceed NNE., leaving the Valmian track to r., while the track to Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar {Route lib, Alternative (i)) lies to 1. The going is excellent, over green grassy hillocks along a scarcely per ceptible watershed between the Fani and the Kashgan, with a clear view to both flanks. Wahsiyan is apparently passed (see Eoute lib, Alternative (i) underm. 88, p. 272). Miles from Dizfal 89 91 105 115 Cross difficult range of foot-hills in front of the Dalich Kuh. Hahak. Camping-ground on the skirt of the Dalich range, near a small stream. General direction to Cham-i-Murt, E. by N. Track is hilly all the way and difficult in parts. Cross the Dalich range at Kul-i-Hisar (apparently NW. of the Dalich Buzurg and Dalich Kuchuk passes : see main route under m. 106|). Descend over fairly easy slopes to the Ab-i-Afrlneh valley. Oliam-i-Mnrt. Apparently in the Afrineh valley, NW. of Ab-i-Sard (see main route under m. 111). Good grazing and abundant fuel. From here the general direction to the Dadabad plateau is N. by E. ? over the Kuh-i-Ghazal at a place called Clmglialu. Slight descent to Camp on Dadabad plateau.

Either in the neighbourhood of this stream or near the Shurab the track crosses the main route. From the Taiyil the course of the track is obscure. The authority says merely that there is a steep descent to the Shurab (sweet water), ' and thence over spurs to the Kuh-i-Bavi by Qalb 'AliKham'. See alternative route given underm.130 below. Kurageh.. Kliurramabad. from the Ab-i-Fani Proceed over low gypsum hills to 'Valmian: deserted T.O. Water indifferent. From here to the Badamak valley the general direction is NE. Proceed over gypsum hills to the foot of the Tang-i-Pinawar (alt. 3,000 ft.), thence by difficult ascent over limestone slopes to the summit (alt. 4,060 ft.)- and from there by a short descent into the Badamak valley. Badamak (near a high conical hill in the centre of the valley). Good water, fair grazing, abundant fuel. The Badamak valley, which runs about SE.-NW., is well wooded and undulating, with many hills of blue shale conglomerate and sandstones. There are lime stone ranges to N. and S. To N. is the Dalich range, an almost continuous cliff, passable only in four or five places. For the Kul-i-Hisar pass see branch route given above under m. 80. N. of Badamak lies the very difficult Kul-i-Sukhteh, avoided even by nomads; for the main pass see below under m. 106|. The hills to the S. are breached in this neighbourhood by the Tang-i-Kashub. The valley is claimed by the Judeki, but occupied in winter by the Dirakwand. General direction to Ab-i-Sard, N. Track winds up the valley. Ascend to the Dalich pass (alt. 6,000 ft.). There are two passes, Dalich Buzurg and Dalich Kuchuk (Great and Little Dalich): the latter is 1^ m. W. of the Great Dalich, which is the better, though both are difficult and stony. The Great Dalich seems to be meant here. The descent is somewhat easier, over limestone slopes, leading into the Ab-i-Sard valley. At the Dalich passes the route is joined by the alternative tracks from the Tirada valley by Ser-i-Gul (see under268 Miles from Dizful in LAND ROUTES 115 116i 118 121 T i ^ m. 44 above) and from the junction of the Ab-i-Lailum with the Saidmarreh through the Tang-i-Lailum (see under m. 66 above). Ab-i-Sard valley. The plain is marshy. To E. it is fairly open, with low hills of gypsum and red clay; to W. there are high belts of limestone, sandstone, and gypsum. The best camping-ground is near the gorge, through which a stream draining the valley flows to join the Ab-i-Afrlneh. Water from stream, fair grazing, abundant fuel. From here to Chimashk the general direction is NE. Proceed through the gorge mentioned above, or by a detour of 1 m. to E., then along the foot of the Kuh-i-Gird, known at its western end as Takht-i-Slml. There is said to be a short cut over the Kuh-i-Gird by a route known as the Takht-i-SimI track, which shortens the distance to Chimashk by about 3 m. It involves a climb of 1 ,800 ft., but is preferred by nomads and is not particularly difficult. Pass an imamzadeh. Pass Qal'ali Nasir, ruined fort. Thence there is a rather heavy stretch of road with steep ascents and descents for 2 m. Cross the Tayin stream (alt. about 4,900 ft.), 30 ft. wide, 2^ ft. deep, rapid current: difficult in spring. The Tayin valley belongs to the Dirakwand (Baharwand). The low hills in the valley are of gypsum and red clay, with conglomeration. Route then skirts the Kuh-i-Ghazal by a stony track, after wards descending to a valley under that mountain. Chimaslik, camping-ground at the foot of the Chimashk gorge. Water from stream ; grazing and fuel plentiful. Chimashk is occupied by Judeki, but Dirakwand also camp in the neighbourhood. General direction to Dadabad plateau, NE. Proceed either through Chimashk gorge (alt. 5,000 ft.) or round the end of the hill (highest point 5,800 ft.), both roads easy. On the north side of the gorge is the Chimashk caravanserai, in good condition, at the junction of the Ab-i-Eaikhan (from about N.) and the Ab-i-Kabgan (from about ESE.), which form the Chimashk stream.w KOUTE 11 a 269 Miles from 1= Dizftil From here an alternative track to the S. foot of the Kuh-i-Bavi (see m. 138), said to be easier than that by the Nal Shikandeh pass described below, diverges ESE. up the rapid Kabgan stream, which 3 m. above its junction with the Raikhan passes through the Tang-i-Bawileh, where are remarkable caves in limestone rock, approachable only with great difficulty. In 1911 they showed traces of recent occupation by Lurs and wild animals. Here it may join or come near Route 11 c (i). At any rate it turns N. on to the Dadabad plateau and thence to the spurs to the Kuh Hashtad Pahlu. Its course beyond this is not described ; but presumably it crosses into the Shurab valley, and either descends that valley to rejoin the main route, or •joins the track which crosses the Kuh-i-Bavi by Qalb 'Ali Khani and comes out on the Khurramabad plain apparently in the neighbourhood of Kurageh (see alternative route under m. 130 below.) 127 130 The Na'l Shikandeh road crosses either the Eaikhan or the Kabgan near the N. end of the Chimashk gorge, and winds up the Raikhan valley, which is cultivated and fairly open. Nal Shikandeh pass. The last portion of the ascent is difficult. The summit is 5,900 ft. The descent on the far side is easy. Dadabad plateau. Camping-grounds anywhere near water, which is plentiful. Abundant fuel. It is said that an alternative route to Khurramabad from Dadabad avoids the Ab-i-Taiyil ' altogether '. (If this is correct the track must skirt round the head of the Taiyil valley.) At any rate it crosses into the Shurab valley, runs up the stream ' for 3 m.' (from where is not clear) to the Tang-i-Jemal-i-Kul, where are the ruins of an ancient fort. Then it turns X. and ascends the Kuh-i-Bavi by an easy valley to Qalb 'Ali Khani, whence a track leads near Ab-i-Sivak ' direct to the plains below ', apparently to Kurageh. The ascents on this track ' are difficult, but it seems shorter'. Compare alternative routes given under m. 80 and m. 121, and Route 11 c (i). 132 135 General direction to the Khurramabad plain, NNE. The track is generally good; there are, however, a few difficult ascents and descents. A few small streams are crossed. Cross the deep valley of the Taiyil (alt. 5,390 ft.). Cross Shurab stream in a deep valley (alt. 4,700 ft.). Koad winds upward, by a tributary stream. The ground is undulating and stony, and the going is bad.270 LAND ROUTES Summit of the Knh-i-Bavi. From here there is a difficult descent over boulders to the bottom of a ravine leading to the plain. (The road to Shah-in-Shah keeps along the top of the hill to r., and is easier, but about 2 m. longer.) The Khurramabad plain is reached (alt. 4,100 ft.), after crossing a rapid brook., Shah-in-Sliah. is to r. on a low spur above the plain: it is marked by a white dome. Water from stream. Grazing good. No supplies. General direction to Khurramabad, NNE. The soil of the plain is clay. Euins of villages in 1911 testified to the destruction worked by nomad tribes in the prevailing anarchy. Road crosses a swampy valley and then fords the Dar-in- Rud, just above its junction with the Ab-i-Khurramabad. The latter stream is generally fordable, but swift and difficult to cross when in flood. It is unnecessary, however, to ford it, as a road keeps E. of the river, and proceeds by groves of poplars to the N. end of the town, where a fine bridge spans the river and gives access to the city on the farther bank.

The routes which are given below pass W. of, or along, the Kashgan, and approach Khurramabad from the WNW. It appears that the easiest lines for cart-road construction between Dizful and Khurramabad are to be found in this group of routes. Thus the route from Chul to Pul-i-Madian Rud (Alternative (i)EOUTES 11 a, b 271 below), and the route from Pul-i-Madian Kttd by Chinar-i-Bardaghul to Khurramabad, form a track which, it is said, ' could be made fit for wheeled traffic more easily than any otherAlternative (ii) to Pul-i-Madian Ktid, which makes a detour to W. of the Karkeh, has been called 'better probably than any other track in Luristan Though the S. end of the Tang-i-Khirsdar on Alternative (i) to Pul-i-Madian Kud is a very serious obstacle, and the crossing of the Kebir Kuh on Alternative (ii) is difficult in one part, the passes and defiles on these routes do not appear, on the whole, to be so bad as those on Boute 11a. The chief disadvantage of these routes as compared with Boute 11a lies in the obstacles presented by the Kashgan, and, in Alternative (ii), by the Karkeh and Saidmarreh. The Kashgan and Saidmarreh are generally fordable only in the later part of the summer and in autumn; the Karkeh is fordable in autumn only. Water is on the whole plentiful. Grazing is generally good. Fuel is on the whole scarce S. of the Kebir Kuh, and generally obtainable to N. of it. Supplies are less scarce in the plains traversed by these routes from the Kumishgan district onwards than they are in other parts of the country between Dizful and Khurramabad. Alternative (i) to Ptjl-i-Madian Run Via Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dxtkhtar This route follows the road described in 11a as far as the summit, or perhaps the northern foot, of the Dum-i-Chul pass over the Kialan range (or Du Farush). It then diverges to 1. and crosses the Kashgan at or near Khurramabad. The track is quite easy except at the Kashgan crossing, and at the southern end of the Tang-i-Khirsdar. The Kashgan is unfordable for at least four months in the year, and may be difficult to cross for three or four more. It can generally be forded with more or less ease from June to November, but has been found unfordable in June. A bridge of about 120 ft. would be needed for it. To make a road through the southern end of the Tang-i-Khirsdar, much blasting would be necessary. Snow never makes this route impassable. For water, fuel, and grazing as far as the Dum-i-Ohul pass, see Boute 11a. After Dum-i-Chul water appears to be plentiful: fuel is generally available. After the Kashgan is crossed supplies are less scarce than on any other route.272 Miles froin Dizful o 80 88 93 LAND ROUTES Dizful.

An alternative route to Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar (see _m. 88 below) leaves Route 11 a at m. 73, near the junction of the Ab-i-Fanl with the Saidmarreh. It follows the 1. bank of the Saidmarreh to the junction of the Kashgan, and then turns up the 1. bank of the latter river. Some distance (1^-2 m. ?) after it passes the junction of the two rivers it goes through a difficult pass. It reaches Puhi-Kurr-o- Dukhtar about 19 m. from the point where it leaves the Ab-i-Fani. Chul Plain. This is crossed in a NW. direction. The track is marshy in places and would be difficult after rain. Grazing excellent. There is cultivation by Judeki, though the ground is nominally Hasanwand. Gurr-i- Hushki ruins are passed in the plain. Then through low gypsum hills. Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dnklxtar (or Pul-i-Shapur), ruins of an ancient Sassanian bridge over the Kashgan, at the mouth of the Tang-i-Khirsdar. Ford in late summer and early autumn just above the bridge (see introduction to this route). The only space near the bridge available for camping is on the farther (r.) bank of the Kashgan. But about 3 m. up the stream there is a small open space on the 1. bank, which can be reached by keeping along that bank in the stream-bed for about 200 yds., and then ascending the bank and following a track at the foot of cliffs. From the open space a footpath, reported practicable for lightly laden mules, leads over the cliffs, through a cleft, to Wahsiyan. See further, pp. 266, 278 foil. At the Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar, water, grazing, and fuel are plentiful. For an alternative route from Pul-i-Kurr-o-Dukhtar to Dureh springs (m. 144) see pp. 278-281. General direction to 'Ali Gljan, NW. Proceed up the Tang-i-Khirsdar (r. bank). In 1911 the S. end of the gorge could be entered by either bank only on foot, and even then with difficulty. When the river is fordable, however, it is possible for loaded mules to enter by the stream-bed. Proceed by easy but stony track through reeds and brushwood over grassy levels.

At m. 95 a small salt spring, undrinkable, is passed ; much gypsum in the valley ; at m. 96 some good fresh springs below the Imamzadeh Sahil Hadum, which is passed at m. 97. At m. 97J reach summit of pass (alt. 4,850 ft.), and at m. 99 reach 'Ali Gijan (alt. 4,200 ft.). 1 The direction of the Kashgan, as followed up-stream, changes from NNE. to NNW. Eoad turning to 1. leaves the stream and ascends the Paru Pariz valley, which is open and cultivated; no gypsum. Track winds up the valley by easy gradients: for 3 m. it needs only clearing of stones to be a good cart-track. The last part of the ascent over the pass (alt. 4,400 ft.) which separates the Paru Pariz valley from the Rumish- gan plain is steep, and though easy for mules would need grading for carts. A track diverges leading direct to Chashmeh Kalag Rad (see m. 102^ below). 'Ali Gijan {imamzadeh), at the head (SE. end) of the Rumishgan plain. Water from springs south of the imamzadeh.

The other branch leads to Qatirchi spring (NNW.) on the N. side of the Kumishgan plain : in this neighbourhood it crosses Alternative route (ii) and proceeds to the Kudbar, Pa Astan, and Tarhan plains. The Rudbar valley near Rumishgan should be distinguished from Rudbar in the Saidmarreh valley {Route lid, m. 91). In the Tarhan plain it connects with Boutes lid and 11 e (iii).

A lternative R oute (ii) to P ul-i -M adian R ud Via plnjreh This route takes a more westerly line to Pul-i-Madian Rud than that followed in Alternative (i). It affords a connexion between the Zorbatiyeh—Deh Luran—Dizful road 10 a) and the Khur- ramabad—Deh Bala road {Boute lid): see m. 0 and under m. 106 below. There is a fairly good road throughout, ' better probably than any other track in Luristan'. It needs to be cleared of stones. Up to Pul-i-Madian Rud the principal obstacles are said to be a short difficult stretch on the ascent of the Kebir Kuh (but see under m 72 below), the Karkeh (see m. 14 below), and the Saidmarreh (Upper Karkeh : see m. 90 below). Snow falls on the parts of the route above 4,000 ft., but not enough to block traffic for more than a day or two. The heat in summer is great enough to make it as a rule advisable for caravans S. of the Kebir Kuh to move by night. Water and grazing are plentiful throughout. Fuel is scanty S. of the Kebir Kuh, but is always available to the N. of that range. No supplies except from nomads as far as the Saidmarreh.

It leads up through the broken country of the foot-hills to Duma Khail and then across a very rugged mountainous region past the bikena Langar and Salun ranges. The road is impracticable for wheels, and passable by mules in some places only with difficulty. It is very slippery and steep in parts.

The following long detour has been described throughout in Eoutes in Persia, vol. iii. Between Dizful and Ser-i-Desht only a round by Duma Khail has been reported on, and more direct routes seem to exist. The road throughout is passable only for mule transport, but seems not to be very difficult, compared with other routes in the Bakhtiyari country. From Dizful to Qal'ah Bazuft the road is (or was in 1890) much used by Bakhtiyari tribes men moving between the Dizful district and Isfahan, and it was said in 1890 to be 1 in very good condition' from Ser-i-Desht. From Qal'ah Bazuft to Khurramabad, it is reported that it could b,e improved without excessive labour. Water is generally plentiful and good, except at Taraz (m. 103^); but in the hot weather it seems to become rather scarce in the first part of the route (as far as QaFah Bazuft), especially at Babadi (m. 59) and Haud-i-Nau (m. 80f). Grazing is generally good, as far as Qal'ah Bazuft, though it becomes burnt up in parts from about May onwards: from Qal'ah Bazuft it is to be had ' at certain seasons'.

As far as m. 54 (Grulgul) there would be no difficulty for pack transport except at the Kashgan river, and road-making would be fairly easy. Between m. 54 and m. 771 some passes which are difficult for laden animals have to be traversed. At m. 90| the Said- marreh has to be crossed : it is practicable for laden animals only in the months July-November (or October). Prom Rudbar (m. 91) to the point where Boute 9 is joined (m. 120^) the road is fair except in the Zangavar valley, and could easily be improved. (In 1897 it was stated that this section could easily be made passable for artillery.) The difficult Akhur Safid pass on 9 has apparently to be crossed before reaching Deh Bala. Water is good and plentiful throughout. Grazing is good all the way. Fuel is very scarce from the neighbourhood of Pul-i-Madian Rud to Rudbar, but is plentiful after that. Supplies from nomads (their camps are generally most numerous round Pul-i-Madian Rud and Gulgul). Some cultivation of wheat and barley, ripe, according to elevation, in May-July.

Authorities;— Routes in Persia, vol. iii (1910), no. 99 (Report of 1897) ; x to Routes in Persia, vol. iii (1914), nos. 99 and 99 a (p. 99). In order to make this route practicable for wheels, much work would be needed between the Rabat pass (m. 9) and the Alishtar 51 plain (m. 221), including rock-cutting at the Rabat and Takatu passes. (The Governor of Khurramabad formerly took guns every year from Khurramabad to Alishtar, but probably their movement was » very slow and difficult, as the road in this stretch was far from being * suited to artillery.) From the entrance to the Alishtar plain (m. 22|) to the Gashur pass (m. 78) it would take a good deal of work to make the road passable for artillery, but there is no rock to be cut, and it could all be done with the spade. From the summit of the Gashur pass to Tamarg (3 m.) the road needs widening and improving for guns: the gradients are not very steep. From Tamarg to Khurramabad the road is passable for all arms: the chief obstacle on this part of the route is the Gumasiab river between Harsin and Hajiabad (see ( m. 90|), which would probably need bridging. From December to February or March there is deep snow as far as 1 the Gashur pass, which may close the route. Beyond the Gashur pass, , though snow falls on the road, it is practicable throughout the year. The section from the Rabat pass to the Alishtar plain is the only part of the route where the country is confined and the road contracted by gorges; but from Alishtar to Chahr (m. 89-|) the route is protected on the N. by high and rugged mountains. Water is plentiful throughout. Grazing is plentiful from April or May to September or October. Bhusa can be obtained in the Alishtar plain in October, and probably in the villages beyond the Gashur pass. Fuel can be obtained between Khurramabad and the entrance to the Alishtar plain, and in the Sirkani valley. Beyond the Gashur pass it is on the whole very scarce, though groves of poplars are to be found here and there. Between Khurramabad and the Gashur pass there is little cultiva tion except in the Alishtar plain. Wheat and barley are sown in September, are available for green forage in June and July, and areROUTE lle(i) 293 cut and threshed up to the end of August. During August and September Indian corn is available, green or ripe. From May to October there are numerous flocks and herds pastured in this country, which is the summer quarters of various Lur tribes. Only in the Alishtar plain are there permanently settled inhabitants, and the country is almost wholly deserted in winter. Between the Gashur pass and Kirmanshah, the inhabitants for the most part are settled in permanent villages. Probably the country has suffered from anarchy and war. The Harsin valley is very fertile and is (or was) well-cultivated, from June to the end of August the crops are green, ripening or being reaped. Numerous flocks and herds were seen here in 1897.

The town lies on the N. side of the valley, which is there bounded by steep and rocky mountains, bare of trees. The gardens round and in the town almost hide the houses. The remains of the ancient castle consist of pinnacles and minarets rising to a considerable height. Supplies could be collected from the valley, which has a considerable area of cultivation and large herds of sheep, goats, and cattle. The water-supply of the town is most abundant, the principal source being a large spring rising in the mountain close to the town. There are numerous broad clear streams among the gardens. Grazing and forage are abundant. There is a site suitable for camping SE. of the town.

(ii) Via Itttwakd and Vanavilleh Authority:—Corrections to Routes in Persia, vol. Hi (1914), no. 99 a (Eeports of October 1908). It has been found impossible to trace in detail the line of this route as most of the places mentioned are not marked on the map I. D., sheets of 1913-14. It appears to go through the Aivandah ('Awandar') pass to the Alishtar plain. The route is described as ' via Bairanwand '. If this is correct, it may perhaps imply that it runs at first somewhat E. of route (i): but the ' Tang-i-Awandar' mentioned on it would appear to be the same as the Aivandah pass of route (i). Both routes go to theROUTES 11 e (i, ii) 301 Alishtar plain. Beyond Alishtar the present route runs apparently SW. of route (i). At Vanavilleh it touches an offshoot of the Safld Kuh and thence proceeds apparently about north to Kaisarwand. and joins route (i) at the Gumasiab, 20 m. from Kirmanshah. The road as far as Gumasiab is fit for pack transport only. No serious obstacles are met with. Water is plentiful throughout. In October 1908 there was good grazing at Kaka Dar and Ittiwand, and hlmsa was abundant at Alishtar. (Grazing would probably be plentiful at Alishtar in the summer.) Little or no fuel is to be had except at Vanavilleh. Cereals are obtainable (at least in late summer and autumn) at Alishtar; cattle and sheep, wheat and barley were plentiful at Ittiwand in October; and provisions of all sorts could be obtained in considerable quantities in the neighbourhood of Kaisarwand. The times given in the margin are those of a caravan. ' Tq mi 0 n - Khurramabad. To the Tang-i-Chinar Dar the route is an open track passable for all transport. All through the Tang-i-Chinar Dar the route narrows, and is very winding. Much undergrowth helps to make it difficult. There are very few ascents or descents in this pass. From the farther side of this pass to the hills before the Tang-i- Awandar (Aivandah?, see route (i), m. 12^) it is a good open track through a valley suitable for all transport. Up the Tang-i-Awandar and down to Kaka Dar the track follows a long steady ascent and descent, but meets with no serious obstacles. The streams crossed are no obstacles (at any rate in autumn). 6 45 Kaka Dar (alt. 5,400 ft.). There is no good camping- ground here. Good and plentiful water from stream. Good grazing. Road enters a defile immediately beyond this point. This is somewhat difficult as the track passes over large slabs of rock covered with water from the stream. Beyond the defile the road is clear of obstacles, but goes up and down the whole way until the plain of Alishtar is reached. The country passed through is bare, without trees, villages, or encampment (October). 10 0 Alishtar plain : see route (i) above, m. 29^. Road over the Alishtar plain is an open level track passable for all transport. From the plain to Lagri it is a narrow winding track passing over bare hilly country. Road has no obstacles for pack animals. Water is met with twice on the road from small streams.302 hrs. min. 15 30 24 15 27 15 LAND ROUTES Lagri (alt. 5,600 ft.). The road from Lagri to the head of the Gachini valley is a track which sometimes broadens out, but is generally very narrow, and here and there rather indistinct. It passes over undulating ground, and is much cut up by nullahs. It is passable for pack transport only. Water in October was met with three times between Lagri and Gachini. Gachini (also called Gatchka or Sarugir) con sists of about 1,000 huts and tents scattered about at the NW. end of the valley (Mumwand Lurs). From here for some distance the road passes over very rocky dry nullah beds: after which, to Ittiwand, it is a good track over undulating ground. There is no water between Gachini and Ittiwand. Ittiwaud (alt. 5,200 ft.). (The Ab-i-Gezru is mentioned in the Eoute Report, but, like Lagri and the Ittiwand valley, is not marked on the I. D. sheet. It is described as easily fordable in October, 20 yds. wide and 1^ ft. deep, and containing excellent drinking water.) In October 1908 about 1,000 head of cattle and 15,000 sheep were seen grazing, and wheat, and barley were reported plentiful, but whether in the neighbourhood of Ittiwand or en route between Lagri and Ittiwand is not clear. For about 2 m. beyond Ittiwand the track winds among hills, crossing several small water-courses, very stony and rocky : mules go in single file. Then on coming out into the Kakawand country it passes over waterless undulating ground with a general decline to the valley below Vanavilleh. Thence up to Vauavilleh (alt. 5,750 ft.), hilly ground, an offshoot from the Safrd Kuh, in Kakawand territory. Camping-ground for a battalion. Water plentiful from springs. Fuel abundant. No supplies. (Grain might be got from encampments 3-8 m. distant.) From here to Kaisarwand there is a good track passing over undulating and hilly ground. It is passable for pack transport only, but could be easily improved, as no serious obstacles are met with. The country is much cultivated, but treeless. The imamzadeh of Bavalin is passed.KOUTES 11 e (ii, iii) 303 hrs. min. 33 45 Kaisarwand (alt. 4,650 ft.), situated in a fertile valley, with several other villages near.

(iii) Via Tarhan and Hulailan Authority:— Corrections to Routes in Persia, (1914), no. 99 b (Aug. 1908). From Khurramabad to Tarhan the route follows the road given in Route lib (to Pul-i-Madian Eud), and in lid (Pul-i-Madian Eud—Tarhan). So far it is easy : the Kashgan is the only serious obstacle, and a cart-road could be made without difficulty. Beyond Tarhan the route is suitable for pack transport only. The Tang-i-Kalan Duran and the Tang-i-Mivajan are difficult obstacles, and much blasting and preparation would be needed to make them fit for ordinary use. From Talandesht to Kirmanshah the road could be made fit for wheeled transport without much difficulty. Water is obtainable in fair quantities throughout. Fuel also is procurable throughout. The grazing in the Serferuzabad (or Mahl- desht) plain is good. Wheat and barley can there be obtained in fair quantities, at any rate after the harvest. In normal times the greater part of the yearly crop is sold. The yearly produce may be calculated on a rough average at 500 Tcharwars of wheat and 500 of barley for every 50 houses or huts (1 650 lb.). The times given in the margin were taken by a caravan going in the reverse direction. hrs. min. — — Khurramabad.

Proceed in a general NW. direction over the plain by a track fit for all transport. Then ascend steadily by a track fit only for mules and donkeys to the Tang-i-Kalan Daran (alt. 6,000 ft.). Caravans cross this pass, but it would need a good deal of blasting and pre paration to make it fit for transport on any considerable scale. Beyond this pass to the Tang-i-Mivajan the road is a good open track over slightly undulating ground passable for all transport. From the Tang-i-Mivajan304 hrs. min, 10 30 16 45 22 0 LAND ROUTES there is a difficult descent of 3 m. to Hulailan. In places the path when used in the reversed direction was found almost impassable. Hulailan plain. Camp near the Qara Su river, from which excellent drinking water may be obtained. Cross the Qara Su near the Imamzadeh Shah Mohammed. In August 1908 the water was up to, and over, the animals' bellies. The stream was 30-40 yds. across, fairly swift, with stony bottom and low banks. From here to the end of the Hulailan plain the road is a broad, level track. Then it passes over undulating ground, and, though easy for pack animals, is impassable for wheels owing to frequent nullahs. In the last 2 or 3 m. in the Jalalavand valley, the road is very narrow, and much interrupted by irrigation cuts. In the last 2 m. the Ab-i-Vezman has to be crossed twice. It formed no serious obstacle in August. At both crossing-places the bed is very stony. At the first the stream is 20 yds. across and nearly 2 ft. deep in August: at the second the stream is about 15 yds. across, is about 1 ft. deep, and has less force of water. The bed is about 100 yds. wide. Camping-ground near the Ab-i-Vezman in the Jalalavand valley. Crops of rice, wheat, barley, and Indian corn in Jalalavand. Fuel is obtainable. From here to Talan- desht the track is suitable for mule or donkey transport only. Ascend the Jalalavand valley, at first gradually, but very steeply for the last ^m. before reaching the Tang-i- Kharribeg, an obstacle, though not a very serious one. This pass leads into another, the Tang-i-Surkhbeg, where the pathway at places is very rough and rocky, and though there are no very steep gradients a good deal of preparation would be needed for use by transport on any considerable scale. Almost immediately after this pass, A camping-ground in the Talaudesht valley is reached. The name Talandesht is given to a valley which runs NW. to the Kalhur country. See also 9. Wheat, barley, and straw are plentiful. Large herds were pastur ing here in 1908. Proceed from here through the Tang -i -Kulilan, where the track is generally good, though there are a few difficultROUTES lie (iii), f(i) 305 hrs. min. parts. There are no gradients over 1 in 9. The pass is practicable for pack transport only. Beyond the pass the broad valley or plain of Serferuzabad, lying south of the Safld Kub, and watered by the Ab-i-Marik, is reached. The part of the plain lying farther NW. is the plain of Mahldesht {Houte 9). Proceed to the Ab-i-Marik by a broad track passable for all transport. The villages of Serpushik (50 houses) and Musamirinj (400 houses) are passed en route : they seem to lie S. of the Ab-i-Marik. There is good grazing in their neighbourhood and abundant water from springs at Musamirinj. Wheat, barley, and straw can be obtained at them. The Ab-i- Marik is crossed : in August it was about 2 yds. (?) broad and 1^ ft. deep: it has steep banks and could easily be bridged : the water is good. From the stream there is only an indistinct track to Sirvanu, but it is passable for vehicles. 26 30 Sirvanu (alt. 5,400 ft.), 100 houses. Water plentiful from three springs. JBhusa for fodder. Large numbers of sheep and cattle. Wheat and barley grown. Fuel limited. The first part of the road, a short stretch going E , is passable for pack transport only. After this stretch the road is practicable for all transport. There is no infor mation as to the line taken by the route, except that it leads to Ser-i-Ab. 30 0 Ser-i-Ab, spring and tank 1^ m. from Kirmanshah (see vol. iii, Boute 28 a). ROUTE 11 f KHUREAMABAD—BURUJIRD (i) Via Chalan Chulan (61 m.) Authority:— Corrections to Routes in Persia, (1914), 88 d : Eeports of 1895 and 1911. This is the main caravan route, which makes a detour to E. and is about 11 m. longer than the direct route by the Bairanwand valley (route ii, below). The hill-slopes favour the construction of a gently graded road, but a little rock-cutting would be necessary on the mes. ii u306 LAND ROUTES Zaglieh pass, and on the descent from the Razan pass to the Silakhur plain. (Guns were taken over the Razan pass in 1911.) The gradient of the road over the Chavlreh Shah needs to be modified for wheeled traffic. The Hurud river requires bridging: it is difficult to ford in spring. The Ab-i-Burujird is bridged near Chalan Chulan, but the bridge needs repairs for the use of carts. The passes are sometimes blocked with snow for as much as a month, and snow may lie on the whole road for the same period, but between the passes it is generally not deep enough to hinder traffic. Supplies are plentiful at Khurramabad and Burujird: little or none elsewhere. Fuel is scarce. Miles from Khur- ramabad o Khnrramabad (alt. 4,400 ft.). General direction to Zagheh, NE. (Map I. D., sheet 9 C, makes it about E.). The road crosses the bridge and ascends a valley running NE. A rapid stream 20-30 ft. wide runs down the centre of the valley. On either hand are rocky hills. The road is in places a mere mule-track, though easily made passable for wheels. Cross stream mentioned above by a bridge 45 ft. long. A track diverges to Kamalwand and Zad, whence Zagheh can be reached. Main road turns NNE. over grassy cultivated plateau and through the Tang -i-Zaideh Shir (alt. 4,900 ft.), south of which stands an imamsadeh. The gorge is 4,300 yds. • wide, and there are rocky hills rising 1,000 ft. above it on either side. Route leaves the tang and follows a stream across the Tajareh plateau. Route ii, below, diverges to 1. Enter a rocky gorge. Beyond the gorge the Deh Safid plateau (alt. 5,500 ft.) is reached. The Darreh Daraz valley is ascended. The track keeps to the W. of the valley to avoid a gorge. It then climbs a steep rocky pass, which could be easily improved to Qal 'ab. Kurisi, a ruined mud fort (alt. 6,000 ft.). Here a track diverges to 1. over Kuh Bumani (7,000 ft.) to Darreh Said (6,200 ft.) in the Hurud valley, 8 m. distant. Route descends again to the Darreh Daraz valley, passing the parts of it known as Chinar Badar and Abistan.ROUTE 11 f (i) 307 NNE. The and ascends swampy in grassy sides across fields Alt. 5,900 ft.

The general direction to Chalan Chulan is road fords the stream by a muddy crossing, gradually crossing a basin 3-4 m. broad, parts and enclosed by rounded hills with and rocky tops. The road is only a track of clay. Descend from the basin into the Hurud valley. The descent is steep and requires the construction of zigzags. Pass Umain, deserted. Cross Hurud river (alt. 6,600 ft.) by ford, generally easy but very difficult in spring. Thence ascend by a good road on a fairly easy gradient past the hamlet of Rang-i-Razan to Summit of Cliavirelx Shah pass (alt. 7,200 ft.). The hills on either side are 1,300 ft. above the pass. Easy descent to Razan (alt. 6,500 ft.), a small village with a good deal of cultivation. It stands on a stream flowing to the Ab- i-Burujird. Good grazing in neighbourhood. Ascend pass S.

Hence a good track leads along the Silakhur plain. Cross the Diz river by a brick bridge on masonry founda tions. It is in fair repair, but is not safe for carts, having no side walls. The river is generally easy to ford except in spring, but it has the reputation of being treacherous. Chalan Chulan (alt. 5,200 ft ), a large village in the plain, here 5 m. broad.

Authority:—Routes in Persia, vol. ii, nos. 68, 70, 71 (Reports of 1898 and 1905). Before the war the main route described below was passable for field-guns or could easily have been made so, and camel-transport could use the route. It is not known how far the road has been improved recently. The most serious obstacles are the larger streams : these were for the most part bridged before the war. The pass at m. 77 is some times blocked by snow in winter. There is much cultivation along the route, and numerous villages are passed. A considerable quantity of supplies could probably be collected at Kangavar. The route is well supplied with water. Fuel is obtainable at least as far as Kangavar. Miles from Burujird 0 Burujird. A route from Barujird fco Kangavar, longer than that by Niha- vand described below, was sometimes preferred on account of its greater security from Lur raids. It makes a northerly detour over undulating or hilly country by Uslrtariin (m. 14), A'b 2 am an (m. 34), Hamilabad (m. 44), Parasia (m. 54), to Kan^avar (m. 72). According to a Report of 1905, the track is good as far as Hamilabad, but needs a certain amount of labour to widen it and improve the gradients for artillery and wheeled transport. Beyond Hamilabad the track is still good, and less labour would be needed to make it fit for wheels. The road is well bridged. There are no serious physical obstacles. The water en route is good and plentiful. Supplies available on the spot at the intermediate stages would not be considerable, but the country-side is fertile, and large quantities of wheat, barley, and rice could be collected from it in their season.

It crosses a salt plain to Sha'aibeh ridge and thence to near Khamlslyeh traverses stony or sandy desert. It is passable for light lorries in the spring, and even in the flood season these can get to within a few miles of Khamlslyeh. The following general account of the route in mid-August 1916 has been given (it is not certain how far the first two stages coincide with the road to Nukheileh described in detail below)Basra—Zobeir, good, except between Fort George and Zobeir. Zobeir—2 m. beyond Nukheileh, ground hard and undu lating, but with 50-yard stretches of softer soil covered with hummocks in the hollows; quite impassable for heavy lorries. Nukheileh—Gubashlyeh, ground broken and very soft sand in the nullahs ; ground studded with tussocks ; quite impassable for heavy lorries, but a road could be found which could take 30-cwt. Fiat lorries loaded ; Fiat lorries with 16 cwt. stores and 10 men stuck in soft patches in 'Roumanila' (Rumeileh?) area. Gubashlyeh— Nasirlyeh, going hard and good, but some little work would be needed to locate a road without soft patches ; Fiat lorries with 16 cwt. stores and 10 men stuck in soft places in Gubashlyeh and Legatteh (Lagait) areas. Apart from light lorries, the road is best suited to pack transport; in the dry season the surface becomes dusty and breaks up ; carts are hard on mules and bullocks are useless ; the best transport animals are the local camels, which can do 3 m. p. h. The sending on of stores in boats has been found successful. For landing-places, see under m. 36, 50, 60^, 77. From about September to November the khor is too shallow for water transport. The Basra—Nasirlyeh railway follows the general line of the route. There is no difficulty about water, which is to be obtained either from the Euphrates Idior or from wells. Pumps and a 30-ft. length of hose should be taken, and it is recommended that an advance party be sent out a day before the main body, as the wells sometimes need cleaning out, after which the water should be allowed to stand for a day. Well-digging may be necessary ; water may be expected1 / KOUTE 13 a 315 at a depth of 6-9 ft. below the surface. For Shabdeh wells see under m 77 Grazing is to be had, for camels only, except at Khamlsiyeh. For fuel, only brushwood in small quantities is available, except near BarjisTyeh wood. In hot weather a look-out should be kept for poisonous scorpions or snakes, which are specially numerous at Gubashiyeh. Miles from Basra. o 13 17 21 Basra. In April 1916 the best road from Makinamalsus or Magil to Sha'aibeh Fort followed the railway embank ment to the Basra—Zobeir road, and then turned along that road towards the Sha'aibeh (or Zobeir) ridge. A de pression (called the Old Bed of the Euphrates) is crossed. The bed is soft, but in early April 1916 was passable for Fiat lorries and A. T. carts. (When flooded, it cannot be crossed by wheeled transport.) The road followed reached the Sha'aibeh ridge, and at 1 m. from Zobeir turned along the ridge to Sha'aibeh Fort. Surface conditions on the first stage were reported in April 1916 to be very variable, and it was recommended that the ground should be reconnoitred the day before any march. (It is not known how far the conditions described above have been modified by later work: see pp. 386—386.) Sha'aibeh. Fort. Good water: (i) well 100 yds. SW. of the fort, 12 ft. in diameter, 26 ft. to water level, about 6 ft. of water ; supply of excellent quality sufficient for a brigade ; (ii) well about 400 yds. the same capacity as (i): it is worked by donkeys and is suitable for watering animals ; (iii) well roughly 300 yds. NE. of fort, of about the same size as (i) and (ii); the water in the well requires frequent changing before it becomes fit for use even by animals. Unlimited space for camping: some brush wood for fuel, to supplement wood ration. General direction from here to Shweibdah, WSW. Road passable for all arms (in early April 1916 Fiat lorries and A. T. carts passed over it: see also introduction). Proceed SW. (225°) towards Barjislyeh wood. Change direction to W. by N. (276°), following main caravan track. Shweibdah.

The water is abundant: it is slightly brackish, but becomes sweeter after the wells have been in use for a short time. Pumps are essential, as other wise the edges of the wells fall in if men stand round them drawing water in buckets. Grazing for camels only. Some brushwood for fuel. General direction from here to Grainat, NW. by N. Eoad in April 1916 was passable for Fiat lorries and A. T. carts, but see introduction to this route, and under m. 32 below. Proceed NW. (311°). Pass Et-Tobah. mounds ; from here bear slightly W. of N. (355°) towards Nukheileh tower. Hukheileh tower. No village. Well of good water and some smaller water-holes. From here to Grainat the going is difficult for wheeled transport. Proceed NW. by N. (326°), along edge of the Euphrates Idiur. to Grainat, low brick-kilns. The water of the is brackish inshore, but was found to be sweet about 300 yds. out on May 1, 1916. The distance from the shore at which sweet water is to be found probably varies. Bellams drawing 3 ft. were brought to within 100 yds. of the shore on May 1, 1916. Grazing, for camels only, near camp. Some brushwood is obtainable, but not much. About 4 m. N. by W. of Grainat is El-Lawi (Alluwi) Point, 1 m. to NE. of El-Lawi ruins. There is a good landing-place at the point, but stores could be removed thence only along the shore in the direction of Grainat, as in other directions for a radius of a mile the ground is too damp for transport. General direction from Grainat to Ratawi is W. by N. The road was passable for Fiat lorries in April 1916, but the stage was found an exhausting one for draught animals. In mid-August Fiat lorries with 16 cwt. stores and ten men stuck in soft patches near ' Roumanila' (Rumeileh ?). See also introduction to this route. Road runs due W. from Grainat. Road enters soft drift sand-hills through which it runs to Kumeileh, two wells. From here proceed NW., skirting more sand-hills. Surface is now harder. The track of the Turkish Army's retreat (1915) is followed.ROUTE 13 a 317 \ Miles from Basra 50 56 58 60i 77 Ratawi. Water from the khor, brackish inshore but sweet 400 yds. out. Bellams carrying about 20 maunds (4 taghars) can be unloaded on the ill-defined island 'N. of Eatawi. When the Euphrates is in flood the low-lying land between Ratawi and this ground would have to be traversed by a causeway. Girazing. for camels only, near camp at Ratawi. Brushwood for fuel in small quantities. From here to Gubashiyeh the general direction is N W. by N. Eiat lorries covered this road in April 1916 (but in mid-August 1916 Fiat lorries with 16 cwt. stores and ten men stuck in soft patches in the neighbourhood of Gubashiyeh, but this may have been beyond that place : see also introduction to this route). Follow tracks of Turkish Army's march in 1915, keeping on an average 1,000—1,200 yds. from the waters edge. Proceed NW. by N. (321°) for 6 m. Road curves westerly. Buildings of Gubashiyeh come in sight. Gubashiyeh, mosque and khan. Excellent drinking-water in Mor right up to the shore. drawing 3 ft. 6 in. can be brought to within 50 yds. of the shore in flood season. Ample camping-ground near the water. Grazing for camels only. Brushwood for fuel in small quantities. Poisonous scorpions and snakes are numerous. From here to Legatteh (Lagait) general direction is W. by N. (so Report: Survey Map no. 43 makes it W. by S.). Road is passable for motor lorries with difficulty. The going is heavy for wheeled transport, and in August 1916 Fiat lorries carrying 16 cwt. of stores and 10 men stuck in soft patches in this neighbourhood. For general description of road from Gubashiyeh to Nasirlyeh in mid-August 1916 see introduction to this route. Troops should keep 1,000 yds. from the water's edge. Legatteh (Lagait). No village. Good water from the Arab reports say that there is a depth of 2^ ft. right up to the bank. Grazing for camels only. Brushwood for fuel in small quantities. From here to Hamldiyeh the general direction is NW\ (WNW. ?). Road is passable for Fiat lorries and A. T. carts, but in the flood season going is heavy.f 318 LAND ROUTES Miles from Basra 89 105? Shabdeli wells lie about 12 m. roughly SE. from Legatteh. It is reported that from either Legatteh or Shabasjiyeh the going is excellent for motors. The desert round Shabdeh has some sparse brushwood, which would present no obstacle to motors. At Shabdeh are several large wells containing good water. One of these taps an excellent spring, and is apparently inexhaustible. It is about 28 ft. deep. In October 1916 Shabdeh was found to be occupied by the nomad section of the Harb tribe from the Hejaz. Hamidiyeh. There is nothing special to mark the camp at Hamidiyeh, except that during the summer there is an Arab encampment on high ground 1,200 yds. from the Mior. Troops marching through at this season should camp nearer the water. Water from the slightly brackish inshore, but sweet about 200 yds. out. Grazing for camels only. Brushwood for fuel in small quan tities. From here to Khamislyeh general direction is given as NW. in Report, from Survey Map no. 43 it would appear to be only a little N. of W.

The country N., E. and S., of Khamlslyeh is flooded 'after heavy rains' (so Report: Survey Map no. 43 has ' from April to September') to a depth of about 6 in. Troops should then camp near Tel Ibareh fort (see above). When there is no flood troops could camp close to Khamlslyeh. Water from flood (or wells at village ?). The flood water is very dirty, but quite sweet. No fuel or fodder. Very little in the way of supplies. The village consists of about 200 houses, mostly reed-built, with a mosque and bazaar.

Bive miles farther on the date plantations on the r. bank of the Euphrates are reached, 1 m. from Nasiriyeh, which by th s itinerary is given as 28 m. from Khamisiyeh. Report of 1916 gives route from Khamlslyeh to Nasiriyeh as follows: General bearing to camp at m. 119 is NW. by W. (305 u ). The going is excellent. At about 1^ m. from camp (the camp near Tel Ibareh ?) there is a deep ditch i which may be avoided by keeping close to the water's edge'. 3 m. farther on pass an unfinished fort which should be left on the r. ? so as to avoid another deep ditch which runs from the fort to the water.

Cadoux describing a journey of September 1903; E. Sachau, Ayu (journey of 1898). The distances given below are rather uncertain, the evidence of the only travellers who seem to have followed this route in comparatively recent years being very meagre. The greater part of the route lay over desert in 1903, the latest occasion on which it appears to have been traversed by a European. For some distance above Samaweh, as far as the fortified village of Sheikh Tweyni and beyond to Abu Qawarir, there was fair cultiva tion. The place last mentioned seems to be about 18-20 m. from Samaweh. Beyond it, in 1903, lay desert. The conditions, how ever, may be somewhat improved now owing to the construction of the Hindiyeh Barrage. The Hilla Branch could probably be again deprived of water in the low season by the closing of the Hilla Regulator near the barrage. See further, introduction to IV C. mes. 11 x822 LAND ROUTES Samaweh. The route followed in 1903 apparently strikes across the plain, in a NNW. direction,, cutting off the bend of the Hilla Branch to the E. Some cultivation and many irrigation canals in 1903. Pass fortified village of Sheikh Tweyni. Abu Qawarir, village and ferry. See IV C (ii), m. 33^. Track skirts river. Imam Hamzeh, shrine on the r. bank of the river. There is a ferry to the 1. bank on which is a village of the same name. The track now crosses barren sandy country, the only vegetation being camel-thorn and a small desert plant with fleshy stems and leaves called by the Arabs and eaten by camels when there is nothing else to be had. The river is touched occasionally. Diwaniyeh. The country now becomes less barren, but few details are given as to the route. It touches the river at intervals. Reach the river, which the route now follows. For the next 6 m. the country, in 1903, was desolate, many of the villages being deserted. The river bed was dry in September 1903, except for pools here and there. See further. Route IV C (ii). Some improvement in cultivation for the next 10 m. Many fortified villages 200-300 yds. apart.

In ordinary weather and in the absence of floods this route is an easy one for all but wheeled traffic. In favourable circumstances and with preparation of the canal crossings near Tawarlj (Hindiyeh) and improvement of the bridges near Hilla, it might perhaps be madeROUTES 14, 15 823 passable for wheeled transport. Water, fuel, and fodder are abundant. There are no supplies en route except at Tawarlj, where there is a good deal of rice and limited quantities of wheat and barley ; there is^also some live stock. The single T.L. which connects Kerbela with Tawarlj follows the route described and is carried upon iron posts; but at the Duweihlyeh and 'Abd 'Auniyat crossings (m. 10^-12) it is slung upon high wooden masts. Miles from Kerbela o Kerbela. Route goes SE., the date-groves of Kerbela flanking the road on both sides for the first mile. The Khor el-Huseiniyeh approaches the r. of the road. The water which escapes from this lake at its NW. corner is used for irrigation. It sometimes spreads over the road and spoils it in places. Road skirts the village of Suleimaniyeh upon its southern side. Bej^ond this village is a bad slough which in times of flood can only be passed in boats.

The track is intersected by various canals from the Euphrates which are wider and deeper as Hilla is approached. Those nearest to the town have frail and narrow bridges, neither strong enough nor wide enough for guns, and without parapet or hand-rail. On the last three-quarters of the way from Tawarlj to Hilla the Birs Nimrud mound (see Boute IV C (i), p. 163, m. 138) is visible first on the r. front, then on the r. Cross the Tajiyeh Canal.

According to native reports this is brackish and unfit for drinking. Shifatlieh (or Shetateh) Oasis begins. Pop. about 8,000, composed of Shiah Arabs (not belonging to the well- known desert tribes) and a few Persians and Persian Baluchis. This is a large oasis about 7-8 m. in length, the same in breadth, with 100,000 palms. Shifatheh occupies a site which is flat but somewhat above the level of the surrounding country. The desert in the neighbourhood is said to be broken up by hollows and stony mounds.

Food is mostly imported. Little is grown in the oasis itself except dates and pomegranates. But lucerne for cattle fodder and small quantities of vegetables are grown in some of the spaces between the groves. A little wheat and barley is grown at Julteh, a place 4 miles west of Shifatheh, and also at a neighbouring place called Eaudheh. There are springs at Julteh, but only rain water at Raudheh. Live stock—1,300 sheep, 450 goats (1910). In 1908 there were said to be 100 horses and 1,500 donkeys, but no camels. Horses in 1910 estimated at 900. Plentiful water-supply for any number of men and animals from springs, the largest of which is situated in Qasr el-Ain (m. 85 below). The water, however, issues from the ground in a warm state, and is slightly salt to the taste, with an odour of bitumen and sulphur. The smell passes away if the water is left to cool, but the taste remains brackish, and the inhabitants say that strangers often suffer from internal troubles when first drinking it, but get used to it after a time. Eain-water is procurable in hollows at Julteh till the end of July. Good water can be obtained by digging to a very slight depth at Khaidhir or Akhaidhir, a place situated in the sandy desert about 12 m. SE. of Shifatheh. Grazing for horses, sheep, and camels is good. There is a bazaar of about 60 shops in Qasr el-Ain. The oasis does a brisk trade with the surrounding tribes. To the N. of the oasis the desert is occupied by the Amarat and the Dilaim; to the S. by the Shiah half-settled tribes such as the Beni Hasan, by the Amarat, the Zagarat, a sub-tribe of the Shammar, and others.

Authorities:—Eoutes in Arabia, 1915, no. 198 (Report of 1915); E. Sachau, Am Euphrat j und Tigris (Journey of 1898) ; Indian Degree Maps, 3 E, 3 I, 2 L ; Force 1 D' Map Serial 79. The stage from Nasirlyeh to Suweij is under water in normal years during May, June, and July. When this is so, the flood may be avoided by making a detour round the western margin of the Butnijeh Lake. The rest of the route is reported by natives to be dry throughout the year, but is much intersected by water-cuts, and there seem to be marshes in the neighbourhood at least during the spring. There is no drinkable water to be obtained on the part of the route between Nasirlyeh and Decha Suweij (said to be 25 m. in length, though the distance in a direct line appears to be about 17 m.), except by making a detour (which adds 2 or 3 m.) to El-Butnijeh, and here from August till the first rains in December the water is brackish and bad, though the Arabs say it can be drunk. If practicable it would be safer to carry water for this stage. The subsoil water is 13-16f ft. below the surface. From Suweij to Kut there is no difficulty, as, even when the bed is dry, good water can be had anywhere by digging from 3 to 6 ft. Unless the Arab tribes are unfriendly, wheat, barley, straw, and meat should be obtainable throughout by arrangement. But owing to the uncertainty of the attitude of the Arab tribes no supplies can be relied on. For a movement northwards from Nasirlyeh, land-transport would be necessary throughout. There are not many boats at Shatreh normally (say some thirty small hell and ten large), and these would probably be removed before troops could reach the town.ROUTE 19 a 331 Nasiriyeh. The route leaves in a NNW. direction. The only obstacles between Nasiriyeh and El-Butnijeh are, according to native reports, about six to eight water channels, all dry, none of them more than 6 ft. broad. These can easily be ramped. Marching very rough, but passable for all arms. (Suleiman Askari's motor lorries were driven down from Shatreh to Nasiriyeh in March 1915, water-cuts being filled in for the purpose.)

The only obstacles are, according to native reports, some three to four small water channels. Decha Snweij, small village. Force 'D ' Report places it at 22 m. Here the route follows the r. bank of the Shatt el-Hai, running NW. for 10 m., crossing two creeks, one small, the other known as the Abu Shabeba, 18 ft. wide ; both dry, or practically so. Shatreh (Shatret el-Muntefiq}, small town. There is a bazaar, containing about 300 shops, which is much resorted to by the Muntefiq. Besides the Shiah Muntefiq there are a small Jewish community and some Sabians. Shatreh is the head-quarters of a in the of Muntefiq, and is the residence of the ordinary Kaza oJlicials. The Turks maintained a peace garrison of one battalion of infantry and two guns here, and some mounted police. Route from Shatreh. to Durajl, about 31 m. (The one authority for this route, E. Sachau, rode over it in January 1898. Distances taken from Indian Degree Maps 3 I, 3 E.) The route runs SW., and passes at about 4 m. a Muntefiq village of reed huts with a watch-tower (under Sheikh Bargash in 1898) ; thence W. by S. to a range of mounds called Tel el-Michzin, site of an ancient city (6J m.). Some distance after this cultiva tion ceases ; the track then passes S. of a line of mounds called Tel Meda'in (10| m.), site of an ancient Babylonian city. A great part of the country here is probably liable to inundation. Thence SW., passing well to the N. of a long range stretching from NW. to SE.j and then passing a considerable mound, Tel Ihza (15 m.), also on the S. horizon, to the Bhatt el-Khar, 15J m. (This is the distance according to the map. The 1898 authority says : 4 a good 6 hours' journey', i.e. probably rather over 18 m.) Thence the route runs SW. past a village of Sa'ih Arabs (16^ m.), with a watch-tower and a primitive well. Thence passing (in 2 hrs.)

Position doubtful. Route crosses the dry canal running E. from the Shatt to the great ruin iliounds of Tel Loh, about f hr.'s ride from the track, and extending for 4 m, along the 1. bank of the canal. The country is said to be a desert in the winter and a swamp in summer. At this point the route, still keeping to the 1. bank, is opposite Mesefi, a village with date-palms on the r. bank of the Shatt el-Hai. Force ' D ' Eeport places this village at 14 m. from Shatreh, and 18 m. from Sheikh Heidar. About a mile farther on, on 1. bank, is said to be Sheikh Heidar. This name, however, is reported to be unknown to the Arabs. Above the point indicated as Sheikh Heidar a dry channel (the Shatt el-'Ama) comes in on the r. bank of the Shatt el-Hai, which here apparently makes a detour to the W. See m. 90, below. Sachau's route apparently followed the Shatt el-Ama, and skirted the eastern edge of the Khor Hafur, a marshy lake which extends for about 8 m.

The neighbourhood of Hai can, in good seasons, afford to export wheat, barley, millet, maize, sesame, and some dates, besides ghi, wool, skins, and hides yielded by the sheep and cattle of the neighbouring Arabs. There is a bazaar of about 300 shops, and several khans and public baths. Three-fourths of the population are Shiahs. There is a Jewish community of some size, and about 100 households of Faili Kurds. The Arabs of the surrounding country are Beni Eablah (mostly of the Serai section). Hai is the capital of the of the same name in the Muntefiq of the Basra The Turks maintained a small garrison here, and there were barracks and a military hospital for one battalion of infantry and a squadron of cavalry. The climate of Hai and the surrounding district is said to be dry and healthy. For fords between Hai and Kut see Appendix to this route. The route continues in a general NNW. direction. Between Kut el-Hai and Zinabiyeh 7 canals are crossed, all dry in l.w. They need ramping for wheels. About 3 m. from Kut el-Hai there is said to be the lower end of the long canal which is reported to run NE. from the Shatt el-Hai to the Tigris, which it enters in the neighbourhood of Mandallyeh tracts. Not shown on recent maps. Kumiyeh ford is passed to 1. Zinabiyeh about 1 m. to 1. of route, on Shatt el-Hai. Nahr Gizau. About this point is a ferry. Atab village on the 1. bank of the Shatt.

Left-hand road leads to a point on the Tigris directly opposite Kut in about 4 m. ; right-hand road goes in about 6 m. to boat-bridge across the Tigris, after traversing which it is some 3 m. to Kut. There is a cross track connecting the two routes along the r. bank of the Tigris. Kut el-Amara. (Force ' D ' Eeport makes Kut 12 m. from Eumiyeh.)834 LAND ROUTES Appendix Notes on the Shatt el-Hai (Fords, etc.) in July-Dec., 1916 The Shatt el-Hai was fordable on July 16, 1916, and practically dry on September 5. Water had begun to flow again on November 15; oji November 19 it had reached a point about 15 m. below Kut el- Amara, and on November 25 there was continuous water in it from Kut el-Amara to a point about 8 m. S. of Kut el-Hai. On November 28, owing to a fall in the Tigris, there was apparently no longer any flow down the Shatt. In August the Shatt was easily fordable between Abu Maliau and Karadi (see under m. 39 above); it had been unfordable at Karadi in June. In August it was almost dry at various points between 4 and 10 m. above Kut el-Hai (m. 95 above), while towards the end of November it was 6-10 yds. wide 1—3 m. N. of that town. At the beginning of July Kumiyeli ford jm. 107 above) was passable. In August there was a ford at Zinabiyeli, the Shatt being almost dry, and early in December, again, there were two dry reaches, each 1 m. long, down-stream of this point. At ISuwe-ia, apparently in this neighbourhood (14 m. below Kut el-Amara), the stream was 5 yds. wide towards the end of November: the ground here looked bad for heavy wheeled transport or guns, though the approaches to the river-bed seemed good. In the neighbourhood of Basrugiyeh and the UTalur Gizan (m. 114 above) the Shatt, almost dry in August, was dry over a stretch of 100 yds. again in early December, showing that the level of this ford is higher than that of any other between Kut el-Amara and' Zinabiyeh. 5 m. above Bas rugiyeh, and about 4-|- m. below the head of the Shatt el-Hai, there is a ford at Bessouia. EOUTES 19 b (i-viii) THE TIGRIS—SHATT EL-HAI Authorities : —Force ' D ' Route Reports, Serial no. 8, May 1916 : Additions and Corrections, September 1916. It appears that in the flood season there is no practicable la,nd- route between the Tigris and the Shatt el-Hai. From the neigh bourhood of Sheikh Sa'ad downwards there is, in the h. w. season, a continuous belt of flood-water several miles wide- That part of the marsh which stretches from the neighbourhood of Hirdabeh on theROUTES 19 a, b (i-iii) 336 N. to the Mudalll on the S. never dries up. But N. and S. of this permanent swamp more or less practicable land-routes can be found in the dry season, the best of which appear to be : Kumeit—Kut el-Hai (iii), 'Ali el-Grharbi—Kut el-Hai (vi), and Sheik Sa'ad-—Kut el-Hai (vii). According to reports, there is no land-route worthy of consideration S. of Kumeit. It has proved impossible to find a through water-route except by going down to the Hammar Lake and up the Nahr Beidha (see p. 185). On all the routes given below there is an absence of landmarks and defined tracks, which renders 'the march of a column in water less country dependent on guides and on compass bearings and distances taken off maps of questionable accuracy '. All these routes, for the greater part of their course, are badly supplied with water. The authorities throughout, except for the first part of route (iii), are Arab reports. Distances are very uncertain. (i) Kumeit—Karadi (75 m. ?) Follow route (iii) to Sadrauiyeh. or Baghailat, 20 m. From Sadraniyeh to Karadi a dry road was reported in May 1916: it appears, however, that owing to lack of water marches beyond Sadraniyeh would be too long for any but mounted troops. The total distance of 75 m. is from an Arab estimate : it is probably somewhat exaggerated. (ii) Kumeit—Qal'at es-Sikkar (73 m. ?) Follow route (iii) to Sadraniyeh. or Baghailat (20 m.). From Sadraniyeh a route runs to Qal'at es -Si &amp;kar via Hach- chamat' (Hachaima ?) wells : it is doubtful whether it is passable for wheels. Marches from Sadraniyeh would be too long for any but mounted troops. The total distance of 73 m. is from an Arab estimate: it is probably somewhat exaggerated. (iii) Kumeit—Kut el-Hai (50 -55 m. ?) This route apparently becomes passable in July or August. In the h.w. season Sadraniyeh or Baghailat can be reached by boat, but there is no through water-route. Some bridging would apparently be needed for wheels on the S. bank of the Dujeileh (see route below, m. 6 and m. 8), and perhaps also on the N. bank. Water can always be obtained from the Dujeileh (or from the marsh to N.) as far as Siderat ; after that there is none until Khor Umm Uateibeh is reached. Grazing is good on both banks of the Dujeileh to Sadraniyeh or Baghailat: after that there is none until336 LAND KOUTES Khor Umm Gateibeh, when it is good. Fuel from scrub. Sheep on both banks of the Dujeileh for the first 20 m., and generally at Khor Umm Gateibeh. In September 1916 large quantities of grain and bJtusa were to be found at the Sadraniyeh and Baghailat forts. On September 22, 1916, the water in the Dujeileh was of the following dimensions:—From the point where the Chediyeh Creek took off from it, for 3 m. westward, it had shrunk to a channel 8 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep ; after 3 m. it widened to 45 ft., and had a depth of 3-3^ ft., as far as a point f m. E. of Sabab Abu Kashaibeh. Then it gradually shallowed till it was only a few inches in depth at a point i m. SW.of Sabab Abu Kashaibeh. Thence again it gradually widened to 150 ft., with a depth of 5 ft., at 4 m. SW. of Abu Kashaibeh. At 4 m. E. of Baghailat the width increased to 180 ft., and the depth to 6^ ft. (Unless these distances follow the windings of the canal, there is some discrepancy between them and the distances given in the itinerary.) The following points on the Dujeileh are good land marks, and might be used as signalling stations: Rumeileh Mound, on S. bank, 3 m.

Sabab Tel Daraj, canal, at beginning of September 1916, 9 ft. wide, 2 ft. deep, with muddy bottom, impracticable for wheels. On September 22, 1916, this stream could be avoided by a detour to N. along the edge of the marsh. Proceed along road practicable for all arms. Sabab Abu Kashaibeh., impracticable for wheels. This stream cannot be turned. The ford is 100 yds. above its junction with the Dujeileh. It has a firm sandy bottom and sloping banks. On September 22, 1916, the water was 1-| ft. deep and 15 ft. wide. At the junction with the Dujeileh the crossing of this canal is muddy and treacherous.

Cross the Xahr Fitnah, the bed of which is 8 ft. wide and 6 ft. deep (3 ft. of water at the beginning of September). From here to Sadraniyeh there are several small irrigation channels to be crossed, but these are no obstacles. Sadraniyeh. Eoute Eeport states that the preceding route is followed from here, which would make a crossing to the other bank of the Dujeileh necessary. But the Dujeileh seems to be 4-5 ft. deep in September in this neighbourhood, and it may perhaps be possible to con tinue along the bank of the canal and join the preceding route near Siderat. The direct route from here to Kut el-Hai goes about WNW. from Sadraniyeh. This direct route, which passes by Hachaima wells, runs over very broken ground and is impracticable for wheels. Kut el-Hai.

Authority: —Sarre and Herzfeld, ArcMologische Reise im Euphrat- und Tigris-Gehiet (account of a journey in February 1908) ; native informtion, 1916, This route follows the dry course of the Shatt en-Nil across a plain inhabited only by nomads, except in the neighbourhood of Hilla. The plain has a very slight slope from W. to E. (about 30 ft. in 50 m.). The only eminences are mounds marking the sites of old settlements, and the banks of dry canals. The soil is alluvial. In the shallow depressions of the plain, flood-water from the Euphrates from time to time forms large marshes, which may remain for one or more years if they receive no further supply from the Euphrates. If renewed by more flood-water they may continue for decades. Their water becomes more and more salt, and even tually they dry up, leaving a salt crust on the soil. So long as the water is not too brackish, the nomads settle on the edges of these Mors, and here and there practise a little cultivation.

Via Kerbela Authorities :—Lorimer, Gazetteer of the Persia (1908; Report of Nov. 1905) ; Military Report on Region between Baghdad (1911 ; Eeport of 1903). General direction of route, SSW. This is not a metalled road, but is suitable for wheeled traffic in ordinary weather, and is the main carriage-road to Kerbela, Nejef, and (as far as m. 29) Hilla. Travellers used to take one carriage to Museyib, where they crossed the Euphrates by a bridge impassable for wheels in heavy rains, and another carriage thence to Kerbela and Nejef. The whole country is stoneless, with brown soil, and the road, full of deep ruts, is in places a foot deep in dust or mud according to weather; but when one track is too much worn another is taken. The country from Baghdad to Museyib is, though cultivable, for the most part desert. There is cultivation here and there in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and near Mahmudiyeh (m. 21) and Iskanderiyeh (m. 33). There are permanent marshes between m. 10 and m. 15. From Museyib to Kerbela the road skirts the belt of cultivation along the Huseiniyeh Canal. There is abundant water on the route from streams and canals, but no bushes except shoh, or thorny plants. Fodder is available at Mahmudiyeh, Iskanderiyeh, and Museyib. There is fair camel grazing all along the route, and supplies are obtainable in limited quantities at Mahmudiyeh, Iskanderiyeh, and Museyib. Double T.L. to Hilla accompanies route to neighbourhood of Museyib. For note on connexions between the N. part of this route and the Tigris below Baghdad see Appendix at end of route. Miles from Baghdad 0 Baghdad. Leave by south gate along embankment, pass railway station, and cross brick bridge with ramp leading up to it over the ruins of the old city wall and ditch. Water sometimes collects on either side of the bridge in pools 1| ft. deep, and might be an obstacle to guns, but not to cavalry or infantry. From a short distance beyond this bridge to the Kharr bridge the road— 346 LAND ROUTES Miles from Bagiidad 8 10 15 runs along the top of an embankment which is revetted with brushwood, and pierced at intervals by brick cul verts giving passage to flood-water that crosses the line of the road here in wet weather. The top of the em bankment is about 15 ft. above the surrounding country, and is generally 24 ft. wide: where it leads on to the Kharr bridge it attains its maximum breadth of 45 ft. Kharr bridge, an iron (trussed-girder) bridge over Khan- Canal (dry to the end of l.w. season). Toll-house and 12 other houses. The ends of the bridge, both of which are approached by ramps, are two stone abutments, 16 ft. broad and 54 ft. long, projecting from either bank. The central portion consists of a single iron girder 171 ft. long, carrying a metalled roadway 9 ft. wide with an iron footway 2 ft. wide upon either side of it. In April when the water in the Kharr stream is 10 ft. deep, the height of the roadway above the water is 12 ft. At the S. end of the bridge, on the E. side of the road, is a two-storied brick house, behind which are about 20 mud houses. After crossing the Kharr bridge the road trends to the S., diverging from the bridge embankment, which continues westward for about 2 m. and ends in the desert. The road, after striking a bend of the river, immediately leaves it. General direction S. by E. Pass Zhan el-Kharabeh, a ruined caravanserai E. of the road. Cultivation in neighbourhood. Swamps begin and continue till m. 15. The country is reported to be sometimes dry, but apparently in some years (as in 1903) it may be half under water even in the dry season as far as can be seen on each side. In flood time this part of the country is described as one sea of water on which are numerous boats. Snipe and duck are found here in the season. There are two water -channels (at m. 10 and m. 11) with large pools of water in them. These two channels are in flood-time navigable, and carriages cannot cross them. The road itself is raised and is only very rarely under water. From here direction of the road is S. Open country begins, lying too high for irrigation or in undation. Irrigable country begins again in the neighbour hood of Mahmudiyeh. Ample water in wells.ROUTE 21a (m) 347 Khan Azadeh, deserted caravanserai on the W. side of the road. (Another account places it at at m. 13.) As Mahmudiyeh is entered the canal of the same name from the Euphrates is crossed ; the canal has been found to be here 27 ft. broad and 4 ft. deep in November: it flows for 8-9 months in the year ; the bridge over it (in good repair in 1908) is 18 ft. wide, and has a small arch of 6 ft, span in the middle. A little higher up the canal is only 10 ft. broad. This canal is the property of the Dd'irat es-Saniyeh, and irrigates fields of wheat, barley, and millet. Mahmudiyeh.

The khans are mostly defensible, one of them being partly loopholed and provided with circular towers at the four corners. In the aggregate these khans would provide accommodation for about 1,000 men and the same number of animals. Water muddy but good. Some of the Dilaim tribe camp in the neighbourhood in the cold weather. There are also a Sanlyeh or store-house, and a Sanlyeh primary school. The place formerly contained some zaptiehs and a few regulars. Direction slightly W. of S. For routes to the Tigris see Appendix at end of route.

Iskanderiyeh, 50 mud houses with a khan and several brick houses. The canal on which it is situated belongs to the Ud'irat es-Samyeh. Cultivation is being rapidly developed, especially to the E. of the village; there is also some grazing in the neighbourhood, and numerous flocks and herds may be seen in winter between Iskanderiyeh and Museyib. The school and mosque are the property of the Dd'irat es-Saniyeh, which is repre sented by a local manager. The inhabitants are nearly all Shiah agriculturists. Route proceeds SSW. Just beyond the village the Nahr Iskanderiyeh, a deep canal from the Euphrates, is crossed. It was spanned in 1914 by a brick bridge in a fair state of repair.348 LAND EOUTES Miles from Baghdad Between Iskanderiyeh and Museyib there is sometimes an extensive slough, known from the tract of country in which it is situated as Abu Luqa. The road strikes the 1. bank of the Euphrates not far above Museyib town. About 50 yds. before reaching the river bank it crosses a high brick bridge (roadway 10 ft. wide) over a deep canal. The approach to Museyib is along a broad embankment, carefully revetted for 600 yds., which contains the river at this point. The river tends continually to break through to the ancient bed of the Euphrates at this bend. Until extensive works are carried out, the town of Museyib must remain from this cause liable to destruction, and the Hindiyeh Barrage might be rendered at least temporarily useless. Museyib is entered through plan tations. Museyib. The Euphrates, which runs through the middle of Museyib, is crossed by a boat-bridge of pontoons, a rickety and ill-maintained structure. Some of the boats are connected only by insecure gangways without hand rails. This bridge is reported (1914) to be dangerous for loaded animals, and impassable for wheels. Banks of river 20 ft. above water level, the upper 15 ft. of whi»h are steep. Kiver here 185 yds. wide, 8 to 10 yds. deep: current 2^ to 3^ m.p.h., at time of l.w.; 5 to 6 m.p.h. in high flood.

The banks of the Wall are 45 ft. apart, 25 ft. high, and precipitous ; the stream at the bottom flows 6 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep. A short distance beyond the Wall the road crosses the Hamidiyeh distributary, which has banks 25 ft. apart and 16 ft. high, the flow of water being similar to that in the Wall. The bridge over the Hamidiyeh is of brick, and carries a roadway 8 ft. wide. Cross another distributary known as the Abu Suleiman, narrower than the preceding ones, and spanned by a very narrow bridge of wood and earth.

A quarter of a mile on the r. is Kawaz Huseiniyeh, a square fort with 50 Arab huts, and another quarter of a mile on Qal'ah Sa'ud, a square fort with 20 huts, also on r. (1903). For the next 5 m. the way lies along the r. bank of the Huseiniyeh, and a number of small canals are passed, the bridges over which are bad and unfit for wheels. The road then crosses to the 1. bank of the Huseiniyeh by the Pal-i-Sufaid; roadway 20 ft. wide, in bad repair. For the last few miles the way lies through dense date plantations; and in the last 3m., that is from Pul-i-Sufaid to Kerbela, there are continuous walled enclosures ad joining it on either side. Kerbela. N ote on the H useiniyeh beyond K erbela . See also on the Huseiniyeh, pp. 174, 176, 395. The Huseiniyeh Canal, 3 m. beyond the Pul-i-Sufaid, passes N. of Kerbela town, and divides, at a bridge NW. of the city, into two branches. One of these runs off in the direction of the tomb of Hurr, about 3^ m. NW. of the town. It is called the Kashdiyeh, and is much larger than the other. At its entrance it is 24 ft. wide, with banks 20 ft. high, and flows 12 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep in winter, being practically dry from June to November. After running NW. for some distance it turns SW. and approaches Razazeh on its E. side. In this reach it has the land called Qurtah, inhabited by the Yasar tribe, upon its r. bank. Razazeh (about 12 m. from Kerbela) is a small estate with about 750 inhabitants, which in 1908 belonged by grant from the Vali to an Anazeh sheikh, who, with his cousin the Kaimmakam of the place, were tent-dwelling Bedouin. There was a mud granary in the place, formerly a fort. The value of the Government share (^) of the crops of Bazazeh is estimated at 500 liralis per annum. Beyond Razazeh the Rashdiyeh turns S. and soon ends in a marsh called Khor Abu Dibs.350 Miles from Baglidad 65 69 73 74 76 77 LAND EOUTES The other branch of the Huseiniyeh, the Hanaidiyeh, circles round Kerbela town, near which it is 20 ft. wide, with banks 25 ft. high, and is 4 ft. broad and 1 ft. deep in winter, but practically dry from June to November. It flows to the Khor Huseiniyeh or Khor es- Suleimaniyeh, as it is also called from the village of Suleimaniyeh —a large lake or open swamp, fed also by waste water from the Huseiniyeh, and from the Hindiyeh Branch of the Euphrates. From Kerbela, after leaving the belt of gardens and date- groves, about 1 m. broad, that surrounds the town, the road goes SE. by S. over flat, featureless desert; to W. of the road the desert is of yellow sand and fine gravel; on the E. is ground which is under water at flood time, but on which at other times there is good cultivation and grazing. About 2-| m. beyond the belt of gardens and date-groves, water-holes (brackish water) enough for 1,000 camels a day. Water-holes, pools, and swamps, with an unlimited quantity of water on 1. Khan Noqeileh. There is here a large caravanserai 100 yds. square with walls 19 ft. high on the outside; it would accommodate 400 horses and 300 men. There are the usual open cubicles round the courtyard, and the usual back-galleries of stables. Water from a well m. distant. There are two other small khans at this place, each of which would hold 50 horses and 20 men. No supplies are obtainable except a little chopped straw. Large inundations on 1. Abu EiUyeh.

The Nahr Abu Eu'yeh is a natural channel filled with water up to m. 87, where it is dammed up for irrigation ; it is a difficult obstacle, as the bottom is soft mud. After m. 87 there was no water in the Abu Eu'yeh in autumn, 1903. (According to the Persian Gulf 1908, about midway between Noqeileh and Khan Hamad (m. 87 below), a stream 50 yds. wide and 4 ft. deep, said to be a branch of the Shatt el-Hindiyeh, is twice struck on the 1. of the road, and this, it is said, appears to be part of the Si'adeh mentioned in JRoute 21 b, m. 90^.

The outer walls of the enclosure are 18 ft. high ; and, as there are parapets above the roofs of the stables, the whole could be easily defended against rifle fire. There is accommodation for 500 horses and 1,000 men. Besides the large enclosure there are 2 or 3 small khans and about 50 ordinary mud houses. Water is from wells, and is said to be always sufficient, but food and fodder are scanty. To the S. of this place is sandy desert, and to the N. and E. of it are about 400 date-trees. The direction of the route continues SSE.; the road is sandy for some distance after leaving Khan Hamad. It runs between the desert on the r. and low-lying lands connected with the Hindiyeh on the 1.

Outside are two small khans and a few coffee-shops, and about 200 yds. to the E. are some 30 Arab huts. The place would hold 800 horses and 600 men; but there are practically no supplies. Water is obtained from wells and from a canal which comes from the Shatt el-Hindiyeh. The route goes SSE., and lies over fine sand which makes the going heavy. Nejef.352 LAND KOUTES Appendix The following connexions between the N. part of the above route and the Tigris below Baghdad are reported (native information, 1916). (i) Mahmudiyeh (m. 21 above) to Pal: This route, 13 m. in length, follows the Mahmudiyeh Canal until due S. of Khiamiyet, where it turns NE. Some small nullahs are crossed, easy to fill or bridge. Track is well defined, level, and firm in dry weather, and passable for all arms and transport; impassable after heavy rain. Wheat, barley, and millet are principally cultivated hereabouts. Wood, mostly tamarisk and camel-thorn, is plentiful. Water at all seasons from canals or wells sunk in their beds. Ctesiphon arch is in view all the way. (ii) Mahmudiyeh (m. 21 above) Hurlyeh This route, 12 m. in length, follows the S. side of the Mahmudiyeh Canal, and leads direct ESE. to the Hurlyeh tract on the Tigris (see Route III C, m. 166^). Track passable for wheels in dry season; impassable in flood season. There are two sweet wells at Jebur forts, 4 m. SSE. of Mahmudiyeh, and 3 m. S. of the route. (iii) Khanel-Bir (m. 26 above) A direct route, 14 m. in length. It is distinct for about half this distance, after which it is lost in the desert, but Ctesiphon arch becomes visible as a mark. At first slightly undulating and broken, it afterwards becomes level and firm, and is possible for all arms and transport in dry weather; impassable after rain. Water from irrigation cuts when river is high ; good water can be had at any time by digging to a maximum depth of about 12 ft. Camel-thorn is plentiful. A few donkeys and pack-horses are available. (iv) Museyih (m. 41 above) This route, 20 m. in length, crosses a canal ^ m. out of Museyib, by a good bridge. The canal is 15 ft. wide, and always contains water, with 2 ft. of mud at bottom. For heavy transport or guns a new bridge would be necessary. At Khan el-Hasweh, 7-| m., track crosses the road to Hilla and Nejef (see 21 b, m. 34). The country throughout is flat, and the route suitable for all arms. No water except at Khan Hasweh ; grazing very poor.ROUTES 21 a, b 353 EOUTE 21 b % BAGHDAD—NEJEP (97| m.) Via Hilla Authorities : —Lorimer, Gazetteer of the Persia 1908 (Report of December 1905); Military Report on Region between Bag 1911 (Report of 1903); and other information. This is an unmade road, but is fit for driving as far as Hilla. The route follows the Kerbela road to m. 29. From Hilla to Nejef there was, in 1903, a path for pack animals only. As far as Hilla the greater part of the route passes through countiy which, although cultivable, is for the most part desert, with scanty grazing. There are a few scattered permanent villages surrounded by areas cultivated at flood time, when there is water carried in those canals still in good order. From the ruins of Babylon (m. 56) to Hilla the route runs through cultivation and vast date plantations. The construction of the Hindiyeh Barrage may have already improved the character of the country for some miles to the N. of Babylon. As far as Hilla water is plentiful throughout, and there is good camel grazing. Firewood is abundant, but practically no other supplies are obtainable. A double line of telegraph runs from Baghdad to Hilla. S. of Hilla the road, after passing through an area impoverished, till recently at least, by the drying up of the Hilla Branch of the Euphrates, runs through country which in 1903 was inundated for a great part of the year, the area and depth of the inundations varying with each annual flood. For the last 7 miles the route runs over sand and gravel. These conditions may have been modified by the Hindiyeh Barrage. Water on this part of the route was, in 1903, described as abundant; fuel and fodder were not scarce, and it was thought that large quantities of live stock and grain could always be collected. Miles from The route leaves Baghdad by the Baghdad—Kerbela road (see Boufe 21 a). The route diverges gradually to the 1. from the Baghdad— Kerbela—Nejef route 2-4 m.

The khan is a one-storied building with a courtyard surrounded by 38 arched recesses used as lodging-places. Behind these recesses are rows of vaulted stables. Parapet wall, about 4 ft. high, runs all round the roof. The courtyard would accommodate 100 men, and the stables 150 animals. Attached to the khan is a village of some 60 domed brick dwellings and two coffee-shops. A few animals are owned in the village, but supplies, except firewood, are not to be obtained. The inhabitants are nearly all Sunnis. The soil in the neighbourhood is a gritty mixture of pebbles and sandy clay. The cultivation, of which there is a good deal in the direction of Iskanderiyeh, all belongs to the es-Samyeh. There was a small Turkish post here. Grass huts on r., water from distant wells near Iskanderiyeh. Museyib Canal marked on map about here. Another canal indicated, and some distance farther on (at or before m. 44) a third canal.

They are described in detail in the Handbook of Arabia (in preparation), from which the following notes are taken. They are possible for the passage of regular armed forces of moderate size, if special arrangements have been made for transport and supply on the way. Thus over the route Darh (from Samaweh or Nejef to Ha'il) Turkish columns have twice marched in recent years (1903 and 1905). On the first occasion 2,000 men, on the second six battalions, got through to Ha'il and beyond. But it should be observed that on each occasion they had been invited by the Emir of Ha'il, who provided guidance and transport. Without these facilities (still more, had the Emir actively opposed) the result would probably have been different. The distance from Samaweh to Ha'il was covered by Ahmed Feizi's force (late winter, 1905) in about three weeks. Supplies are generally unprocurable. In spring, animals for killing might be obtained from herdsmen near the track. Forage exists only for camels. Fuel is afforded by sparse and low bush vegetation in the desert hollows, and a comparatively small party would soon exhaust a considerable area round its camp. Water on the routes from Samaweh, Suq esh-Shuyukh, and Nejef is scanty and difficult of access except after rain, when pools might be found: up to within 70 m. of Ha'il there are on these routes very few permanent wells yielding a sufficient supply for more than a small party (Hayyanlyah, Hazil, Loqah, Leinah).

This is an impor tant route with no serious obstacles: there are wells at most of the368 LAND ROUTES stages, and pools which remain for about a week after rain. There is generally enough grazing for a small caravan. No permanent settlement occurs between Jahrah (m. 20 from Zobeir) and 'Ain ibn Faheid (m. 316^). At Riqa'i (m. 96) the route is joined by a track from Zobeir (six stages, about 123 m.), on which no water is to be found : Handbook of Arabia, vol. ii, Eoute 8, and Chapter II, B (i). There is also a route, very badly supplied with water, from Koweit to Zilfi (295 m.)—see Handbooli vol. ii, Eoute 10, and Chapter II, B (i)—and there is a direct route from Koweit to Eiyadh, with long waterless stages.

The route is possible for camel transport. Water is obtainable except for four stages between Qasr Blr Shagrah (m. 21) and Blr el-Arkamlyah (m. 101), and for two stages between Blr Unsab (m. 151) and Blr Umm 'Amareh (m. 194).

About 50 m. N. of Leinah the western branch of this road comes in from Nejef. At Leinah wells (m. 160) the Darb es-Selman diverges to Ha'il. The track to Boreidah runs through Qusaibah and Ayun el-Qaslm. Heavy going for laden camels and stony ground likely to lame camels occur in parts of this route. Water up to Leinah is indifferent in quality or dependent on rain, and is very scarce between Leinah and Qusaibah (m. 309). Fuel and camel-grazing are scarce till Leinah is reached. There is no per manent settlement between Samaweh and Qusaibah, and no supplies are obtained up to Ayun (m. 337). Transport animals other than camels are owned in numbers by the tribes about Samaweh.

Going is generally good except after rain. Water is not plentiful. At all regular watering-places except Loqah (m. 163) there is sufficient water only for small caravans. Permanent wells are very few (Loqah at m. 163,Hayyanlyah at m. 247-|, Qulban et-Tayyim at m. 307-|, and Jeithanlyah at m. 320^).

The presence of herds in the neighbourhood of the northern part of the route suggests that there are water-holes at some distance from the track. In winter there is camel-grazing all along this route. In winter and spring fresh meat can be obtained from herdsmen. Otherwise, no supplies are obtainable. (c) Koute via Hazil wells. See Handbook vol. ii, Eoute 5, and Chapter II, A (ii) (a). Distance about 372 m. At Blr Samlt . (m. 82) a route from Kerbela comes in. From here to Blr Hazil (at m. 198), and from Blr Hazil to Blr Atwa (at m. 288), water is obtainable only from rain-water pools, dry in summer. Fuel and camel-grazing in most places. No supplies.

Rails were laid practically throughout by the middle of November 1916. (Compare Routes III A and 4.) (ii) Basra —Nasiriyeh line. This starts from Magil and passes Basra town in the neighbourhood of the Zobeir Gate, and thence follows the line of a hund across the low-lying plain, liable to inundation, which extends to the W. of Basra. Having crossed this area the line apparently runs about parallel with, and not far from, the edge of the Euphrates inundation. The line had been completed as far as Khamlslyeh by the middle of November 1916. Between Khamlslyeh and Nasiriyeh the line crosses ground subject to inundation, and will be embanked when completed. (Compare Boute 13 a.) (iii) Ridliwaniyeh—Baghdad Decauville line.—This line con necting the Euphrates with Baghdad apparently starts from near the mouth of the Ridhwanlyeh Canal {Route IV D, m. 61) and runs by Abu Thubbah and Tel Aswad [R IV D, under m. 66), There are stations at the places named, and also at Kharr near Baghdad (apparently in the neighbourhood of the Kharr bridge, 21 a, m. 3). It was reported in May 1916 that the trucks on this line were man-handled.GAZETTEER OF TOWNS AHWAZ-NAZIRI, On the 1. bank of the Karun. Lat. 31° 20', long. 48° 41/.

General Description. —Ahwaz village lies on a somewhat high bank at the head of the Ahwaz rapids at the NW. end of a low range of sandstone hills which subside before reaching it. Naziri village (or Bandar-i-Nazirl) lies about 1 m. S. of Ahwaz below the rapids on a slight elevation overlooking the river: opposite it is the village of Aminlyeh. The importance of Ahwaz-Nazirl lies mainly in the position of the two villages above and below the practically unnavigable rapids of the Karun. Cargoes brought up or down the Karun have to be transhipped here (see Route II A). Before the war a horse-tramway, belonging to the Persian merchant Mu'in et-Tujjar (see under Mobarnmareh), conveyed goods between Nazirl and Ahwaz wharves. In 1914 there were apparently three wharves at Nazirl, and two above the rapids. a a 2372 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Climate. —Rainfall for 1913, 12-62 in.

Supplies and Commerce. —Ahwaz is a centre of the grain-trade of Arabistan, but has practically no supplies locally produced. The water- supply is ample and good. Mules are fairly numerous, and are in the hands of guilds of muleteers, each man owning 3 to 10 mules, but all work together and accept collective contracts. In 1914 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had drilled test-wells at Ahwaz. The Oil Company's pipe-line from Maidan-i-Naftun runs close by. Administration and Authorities. —The Ahwaz district is under a vice-governor appointed by the Sheikh of Mohammareh. In 1914 the vice-governor was the Sheikh's son Khasib Khan. There is a British vice-consul at Ahwaz. AMARA. On the 1. bank of the Tigris, 92-| m. above Kurna, and 151^ m. below Kut el-Amara.

General Description. —The town stands on a strip of ground en closed on the W. by the Tigris, on the N. by the mouth of the Jehaleh and Musharreh canals, and on the E. by the Jehaleh. N. of the Musharreh lies a belt of dry ground, beyond which is a marshy area liable to inundation. E. and SE. of the town lie extensive marshes in which boat communication is possible (details not avail able). At some distance S. of the town are marshes inhabited by A1 Bu Mohammed. The width of the Tigris at Amara averages 197 yds.: its depth varies from about 13 ft. (high water) to about 6^ ft. (low water). There are date plantations on both banks of the Tigris. On the r. bank is the suburb of Daffas, which before theAHWAZ-NAZIRI—AMAKA 373 war was connected with Amara by a boat-bridge. There was also apparently a boat-bridge across the mouth of the Jehaleh Canal N. of the town. Along the whole river frontage (about ^ m. in length) runs an embankment or wharf faced with brick. The northern quarter is the older and extends the whole way between the Tigris and the Jehaleh. Here is a fine building which belonged to the Dd'irat es-Samyeh, and here also were the Turkish barracks, the prin cipal Government offices, and a large covered bazaar. In the southern quarter are 27 well-built houses of recent date facing the river; 15 of them were built by the es-Sami/eh, and the rest by local sheikhs. Climate and Hygiene. —In summer the heat is very great, but dry, and the nights are comparatively cool. Amara has the reputation of being the most healthy town in Irak after Baghdad. In the surrounding country cases of leprosy are said to be rather numerous. Supplies and Commerce. —Wheat, barley, maize, rice, and sesame are brought here from the surrounding country ; fruit and nuts can be obtained in the town. Before the war there was a considerable export of cattle to Syria and also to Basra. rice, and barley were sent to Baghdad and Basra, the greater part of the being shipped on to Bombay and the Levant ports, and a considerable quantity of the barley to Europe. Amara wool was also exported, and is said to be of good quality. Skins and hides were sent to Baghdad. The manufactures of the town are Arab cloaks, Kurdish rugs, and Sabian silver ware. There are perhaps 150 or more shops in Amara. The currency employed before the present war was mainly Persian silver qrans. Inhabitants. —The bulk of the population are town Arabs, but there are large numbers of Lurs from Pusht-i-Kuh who work as porters, and Arabs who appear to live a semi-nomad life in huts on the edge of the city. The larger shopkeepers and merchants are nearly all Persians and Jews. There is a colony of Sabian silver smiths who live in a quarter of the town near the junction of the Musharreh and Jehaleh canals, and a fair number of Christians, who appear to be for the most part artisans and scavengers. Administration and Authorities. —Amara under the Turkish regime was the head-quarters of a Sunjaq of the same name in the Vilayet of Basra. The town was administered by theMutessarif of the Sanjaq, under whom was a municipal council. The garrison usually consisted of one infantry battalion, one squadr on of cavalry, and three or four field-guns. The had a head office here, and there were Mamurs of the Customs, Public Debt, and \374 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Sanitary Departments, and of the Tobacco Regie. A harbour-master superintended shipping and river conservancy. The Persian Govern ment was represented by a consular agent. History. —Amara has grown up since 1860 in consequence of the pacification and material development of the district. The recent prosperity of the town was largely due to the improvement of agriculture by the Da'irates-Sanlyeh. BAGHDAD.

The telegraph poles are of iron on the plains, on account of the annual inundations,) Wireless station at South Barracks, Bridge of boats connecting E, and W. Baghdad somewhat above middle of town. Bridge is 240 yds. long and consists of 24 wooden pontoons, moored both to banks and to buoys in midstream. The roadway is fit for any use, and is protected by a parapet or rail, but the steep ascent and descent at each end make it difficult for horses, and especially at low water for wheeled vehicles heavily laden. A section of three boats near the r. bank can be swung down stream to let steamers or masted vessels through, and the bridge can also be opened at the other end. The whole bridge is removed in particularly high floods, especially if the wind blows hard up the river. River Routes.— (i) To Basra and the sea via the Tigris. (See I A, B ; IIIA, B, C.)

Railway. —The Baghdad—Samarra section of the Constantinople —Baghdad railway is complete. It follows more or less the line of the Baghdad—Samarra road (see vol. iii, The Baghdad station lies SSE. of the r.-bank quarter, and a line 1,300 yds. long con nects it with riverside wharves nearly opposite the Russian Consulate. A horse-tramway runs from W. Baghdad to the suburb of Kazimain (t3J m.), starting from near the bridge of boats : it is a single line of normal gauge ; about 14 two-horse cars (1904), each of which could carry 50 men : sidings about every -l-mile, each accommodating three cars. A fairly regular motor-car service was established, about a year before the outbreak of war, between Baghdad and Baqubeh Khan Beni Sa'id. Anchorage and Landing. —The regular mooring-place for river steamers is on the 1. bank a little below the bridge of boats. General Description. —The town stands on both sides of the Tigris, which flows through it from NW. to SE.: the longer and more important part of the modern town is on the E. bank, and extends for a distance of 3 m., including the Citadel. The breadth of the river here varies from less than 250 yds. to more than 350 yds. Its depth at l.w. is 12-15 ft. opposite the British Residency below the bridge of boats; in h.w. the river has been known to rise as much as 13 ft. in a day, and reaches the depth of 30-36 ft. in April: no steamers can make any headway against such a rise. The current is 1^-2 m. an hour (l.w.); at h.w. it rises to 4 m. an hour. The banks at the town, and for some distance above and below it, are firm, steep, and high, and of good clay soil. Beyond the walls the banks are fringed with a belt of cultivation fertilized by water-lifts, and are planted with date- groves with fodder-crops between the palms. A good many willows are seen below the city on both banks. These serve partly for fuel, partly to prevent the erosion of the bank. But these fertile belts are narrow, and on its landward sides the city is closely hemmed in with parched clay desert. The area in the immediate neighbourhood is low lying and imperfectly protected from flood by embankments ; in h.w. the city may become an island cut off from communication except by boats. About four years ago Nazim Pasha constructed two embankments376 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS {sudd, about 6-7 ft. in height) which encircle the town on the NE,, E., and SE. The N. end of the outer is reported to be about 2^ m. from the Citadel (see below), and to be broad enough for a carriage to drive along it. It runs from Mo'adhdham to Qarareh. On the SE. side of the city a third enclosing an area of about 3,000x1,500 yds., runs past a line of mounds about 20 ft. above the plain, which lie, apparently, 1-2 m. from the S. gate. The western end of this line of mounds is apparently about J m. from the Tigris. The Christian cemeteries lie SE. of the town, outside the wall of the city; they are surrounded by mud walls. The South Barracks, built by Nazim Pasha in the same region, have to a great extent collapsed, as the result of the floods of 1914. On the N. side of the town there is a military hospital a short distance above the Citadel, and near it a large hospital built by a rich Jewish merchant. The city on both sides of the river was surrounded by a wall of earth and brickwork, following on the E. side the line of the fortifi cations of Mustashlr (1095 a. d .) ; this was dismantled about forty- five years ago, but still forms a continuous embankment 10 to 15 ft. high, along which runs a path or road with a deep ditch in front. Otherwise Baghdad was an open town before the present war. On the 1. bank the remains of the city-wall form with the river a rough parallelogram about 2 m. long with an average width of somewhat over 1 m., containing the main town of Baghdad. About one-third of this area (the part next the desert) is empty or occupied by graveyards, ruins, and rubbish-heaps. Towards the S. there were once numerous date-groves, but in recent years these have been rapidly making room for new houses. One of the old gateways (called Bab et-Tilism, the Talismanic Gate, bricked up in 1639) is now a military magazine. It is a fine octagonal tower standing at some distance from the houses in the SE. part of the long face of the wall that looks towards the desert. Towards the NW. end of the same stretch of wall is the Bab el-Wastani (the middle gate), a domed octagonal chamber standing outside the present line of the wall, with which it is connected by a low bridge leading across the moat, flanked with walls on either hand. The quarters of the city that lie on the r. bank begin farther up stream than those on the left, and extend to a greater distance above the bridge of boats. The city-wall on this side follows a more irregular course than on the other, and encloses an area of consider ably less depth, but the vacant spaces within it are not so large proportionally as on the eastern bank. The streets of Baghdad are winding, ill kept, and generally tooBAGHDAD 377 'I, narrow for the passage of vehicles. In the better residential quarters •'ta; there are houses of considerable height, sometimes of three stories, ^■i generally built of soft yellow brick ; in the poorer parts of the town N, the houses are low and built of unburnt brick. There are few ^ inequalities of ground, though there is apparently a rise in the W. '■'&gt; town, and one quarter in the W. centre of the main town is higher ; 4 than the rest. Among what can be regarded as main streets may '■fei be mentioned a road rather wider than the rest, leading from the main bazaar near the E. end of the bridge of boats past the mili- ''i tary barracks and Government offices to the NW. gate (Bab el- Moadhdham): shortly before it reaches the gate it traverses the S Maidan, the principal piazza of the town. A little S. of this, in a ieif back street, is the post and telegraph office. There are also, however, • it a fairly broad asphalted street constructed by Nazim Pasha, which runs iat from the S. end of the bazaars as far as the S. gate, 1 a short broad ill if street which leaves the main thoroughfare referred to above at a it point near the English Club (see below) and runs past the Govern- ®lf ment cloth factory and barracks, and a broad road which runs S. ■'i from the S. gate towards the village of Qarareh. ■t The general view of the town, as seen from a height, such as the tower of the Koman Catholic church, is as a whole flat and iwt monotonous, but certain prominent objects stand out above the id general level. The most conspicuous landmark is the minaret of il the Suq el-Ghazal, or Thread-market, a tower rising to about 100 ft. ifJ in the very centre of the main town. Minarets and cupolas rise here b and there, of which the most prominent are the domed shrine of b Sheikh Abdul Qadir near the SE. extremity of the town, the blue fi cupola of the Jami' el-Maidan towards the W. end, the summit of » the Jami' es-Serai nearer the middle of the town, close to the » Government offices, and the Azbaq mosque, just within the Bab el- J Mo adhdham. There is also the tall chimney of the Government cloth B factory. The modern bazaars, in the district near the bridge, are long, ' vaulted, dark brick structures. The old bazaars are usually covered I, in with wood. The Citadel or Arsenal lies near the river in the t, northern quarter of the E. town, and is used for military stores. The Law Courts and the civil and military offices of the Govern ment form a block of buildings known as the beginning about 350 yds. above the bridge with a considerable frontage on the river. Immediately above is the local office of the The customs-house, on the left bank, is a little below the end of the bridge of boats (the building is proved by an Arabic inscription , 1 ^ new broad road, approximately along this line, and continued through the city to the N., is reported to have been recently constructed.378 GAZETTEEK OF TOWNS still to be seen to have been formerly the Mustansirlyeh College, founded a.d . 1233). About ^ m. below the bridge is the old British Eesidency, now converted into an hotel: the new British Eesidency, with its dependent buildings, is about f m. below this, not far from the SE. end of the town, the largest and most commodious building in the town. At the E. end of the bridge are the bazaars. The English Club is about 100 yds. E. of the old British Residency. The Russian Consulate is about -f m. below the bridge : then follow the French and Austrian Consulates. The Persian Consulate is on the r. bank about 150 yds. above the bridge. All of these consulates are liable to change their site, the buildings not being the property of the respective Governments. The present American Consulate is about 160 yds. below the British Residency. The present German Consulate is stated by a resident in Baghdad (1914) to be about 250 yds. below the Residency. In 1909 it was reported to be about the same distance above the Residency. Within Baghdad itself, apart from Kazimain (see below, p. 383), the most important religious centre is the mosque and tomb of'Abdul Qadir, a most popular place of pilgrimage. 'Abdul Qadir, who died in a. d . 1253, founded the Qadiriyeh sect of Dervishes, still a wide spread order with many members in India. Near the mosque is a teklyeh or hostel for pilgrims, many of whom were British subjects: the hostel and shrine are under the charge of the head of 'Abdul Qadir's family, who holds the title of and has great influence, derived partly from his wealth and partly from the sanctity attached to his position. On the r. bank just outside the N. quarter of the town lies the tomb of Sheikh Ma'ruf, a contemporary of Harun er-Rashid. The tomb is surrounded by a cemetery in which is a building known as the tomb of Zobeideh, wife of Harun el-Rashid, but this identifica tion is certainly erroneous: the princess was buried at Kazimain, though the exact site of her burial is unknown. Climate and Hygiene. —Owing to the neighbourhood of the desert, Baghdad suffers from extreme variations of temperature: the usual summer maximum at 8 a.m. is about 95° F., the winter minimum 31 0 -26 0 . The maximum summer temperature occurs between 12 noon and 5 p.m. from July 1 to Aug. 31, when it varies between 106°- 124° F. The climate is dry : clouds are seldom seen, and rain does not fall on more than twenty days in the year, and that almost entirely in winter. December, January, and February are cool and bracing months; March and April are warm and unsettled, with occasional thunder and dust storms ; May and June are hot but fine, often with a cool NW. wind at night; in July, August, andBAGHDAD 379 September the heat is excessive, and the inhabitants live in sub terranean rooms, serdabs, by day; during October the heat begins to abate, and in November the weather becomes cool again. The prevailing winds are from NW. and N.; the E. wind in the summer is accompanied by high temperature: the S. wind is always oppres sive, and brings dust. The usual town diseases are found here, and the city has been visited at times by epidemics of cholera and bubonic plague (see vol. i, p. 45). Malaria is not generally serious, except when the country round the city is flooded. For the ' Baghdad Boil' see vol. i, p. 45. Brothels are situated in a district about 300-500 yds. E. of the Citadel, and about the centre of the city some 200 yds. from the river. Water is Altered in the houses in large porous jars called zeers, which are left uncovered and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes (see also below on water-supply). There is no modern drainage system; sewage is conveyed on the backs of donkeys to gardens outside the city, and vegetables are there grown on sewage- impregnated soil. Supplies and Commerce. —Baghdad has a narrow belt of date plantations and fruit gardens extending above and below the town, of which the date-palms are estimated at 177,800 and other fruit-trees at 130,000. Otherwise it is not the centre of a productive region, but supplies of wheat and rice come largely from the Hilla district, Beled- ruz, and Mosul; there are 116 flour-mills, worked by horses, in the city. In the Maidan and three other quarters of the town water is supplied in pipes, pumped from the Tigris by an oil-engine of 20 h .p. ; but no attempt is made to filter it or even to allow the silt to settle. The shrine of Abdul Qadir and part of the quarter round it are supplied by water raised by irrigation lifts worked by horsGS and transmittGd in pipes. ElsGwherG tho rivor-watGr is brought in skins on donkeys (1 skin being the usual load) at a cost varying between 2-8 rupees and 4-11 rupees per 100 skins, according to the distance from the river. Many houses in the town have private wells, but the water in them is not sweet, and is fit only for watering roads, &amp;c. The level of water in these wells varies with the level of ® ^ ris * The shops in the town were before the war well provided with European articles, including Manchester cotton goods. Baghdad is the chief industrial town in Irak, but its manufactures are lor the most part not mechanical. Machinery driven by steam was to be found in 1908 only in a private ice-factory, an army clothing- actory, and army flour-mills of the Turkish Government, and in two out ot several wool-presses. The army clothing.factory has a tall380 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS brick chimney which is a prominent landmark. There were at the out break of war three or four ice-factories and flour-mills worked by oil engines. The most important manufactures are the making of silken thread and stuffs ; cotton and woollen goods and tent canvas are also made. Arab cloaks, 'abas, are made in great numbers, and fancy goods both in silk and cotton are extensively produced. There are a number of tanneries, of which about 40 are in the suburb of Mo'adhdham (see below, p. 383): the leather, though only rough- tanned, is much exported to Europe; native shoes and boots are manufactured from it. The Baghdad coppersmiths are famous and numerous, and there is a manufacture of clay earthenware. For purposes of transport the following animals could probably be obtained at a few days' notice: 300 mules, 500 ponies, 1,000 donkeys, and 1,000 camels (1903). The pack-mules are similar to the Persian breed, the ponies are sturdy and country-bred, and the donkeys are hardy and strong. In 1903 there were 80 4-wheeled, 4-horse pilgrim wagons, each carrying about 14 men (depot at Kazimain); also 20 2-horsed carriages and 14 horse-tramcars. A few motor-cars have been used in the service between Baghdad and Baqubeh. Besides the river-steamers, of which the Turkish Oo. owned eight and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Co. three, plying as far as Baghdad, there were about 100 safm large sailing-boats, and 500 quffehs, which are largely used as ferry-boats. Baghdad absorbs most of the import trade of Irak, and Basra may be regarded as little more than its seaport (see under Basra). It is a centre of commercial transport, especially to Persia: it is estimated by experts that three-quarters of the imported goods are transmitted to Persia. Persia in return sends carpets, skins, wool, gums, and opium; and wheat is obtained there in years of scarcity for local consumption. With regard to internal trade the importance of Baghdad is not so great, but it is the principal centre for the distribu tion, throughout the whole country, of cotton piece-goods, which constitute half the total sea-borne imports of Irak. To Mosul are sent sugar, coffee and spices, and metals, and in return come the best wool in this part of Asia, with mohair and oak, walnut, and poplar timber, of which the twc former are much exported. The timber which comes to Baghdad via Mosul comes mostly from farther north. Baqubeh supplies fruit and firewood in return for manufactured articles. At the outbreak of war four British firms had agencies in Baghdad, and there were one or two German firms: the Imperial Ottoman Bank has a branch, and also the Eastern Bank. Inhabitants are of many races and religions. The Jews formBAGHDAD v^y 381 the largest racial group, numbering about 55,000; the Arabs come next with about 38,500, of whom some 7,000 are Bedouin sojourners. The Turks number probably about 4,000, mostly belonging to the official class, the Kurds 5,500, the Persians 5,000. There are about 8,000 native Christians of various races, some Afghans and Pathans, who are mostly watchmen and door-keepers, a few Mohammedan Indians, but no Hindus. The Turks live mainly in the W. part of the main town; the Jews' old quarter lies N. of the Suq el-Grhazal (Thread-market) in the centre of the main town: the old quarter of the Christians lies W. of the Thread-market, but the Jews are over running the Christian quarter, and the Christians spreading east wards. Elsewhere Arabs, Persians, and Kurds are intermingled, but the quarters on the r. bank are predominantly Persian and almost wholly Shiah. Most of the European residents live along the 1. river bank towards the S. end of the town. The Jews are coming more and more to control the trade of Baghdad, making it more difficult for the European merchant to hold his own; during the past 20 years the native Christian merchants have mostly disappeared and many Mohammedan merchants have found themselves forced to take Jews into partnership. Of the Moslems about five-ninths, in cluding the well-to-do families, are Sunnis, about four-ninths Shiahs. The most influential Moslem inhabitant is the Naqlb of Baghdad, Ahd er-Rahman Effendi, who lives on the 1. bank of the river im mediately above the British residency. Of the native Christians the Gregorian Armenians and Chaldaean Catholics numbered, about 10 years ago, each about 2,000, the Syrian Catholics about 1,400, the Eoman Catholics (or 'Latins') about 1,200, the Catholic Ar menians 1,000, Protestants 200, but these numbers have probably increased during the interval, especially as Christians from Northern Mesopotamia have recently been moving into Irak to escape the Kurds. The Eoman Catholics, Syrian Catholics, and Catholic Armenians are closely connected and are under a single bishop (Bishop of Babylon, who resides at Baghdad). These Catholics are said to have increased in numbers in recent years, and may consider ably exceed the totals given above. The Christians are mostly Christians by descent: there are few recent converts. The followers of the different religions and sects are distinguished by characteristic clothes. Administration and Authorities. —Baghdad is the capital of the Kaza, Sanjaq, and Vilayet of Baghdad. The Kasa includes both parts of the town, and on the 1. bank of the river extends both above and below the city, and eastwards to the Diyaleh Eiver. (For the Vilayet see vol. i.) In this there is no Kaim-382 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS makam, the administration being carried on by the Vali of the Vilayet, who resides in the city. The city itself is nominally administered by a municipal council supervised by the civil authorities; in point of fact their power before the war seems to have been limited to offering suggestions to the Vali. Baghdad was the head-quarters of the 6th Turkish Army Corps and had a per manent garrison, the infantry being quartered in barracks capable of containing 3,000 men on the 1. bank between the bridge of boats and the Serai, and the artillery in the Citadel with stables outside the Bab el-Mo'adhdham. There were before the war a British Eesident in Baghdad, a Russian Consul-General, and a French Consul, a German and Austrian Consul, a Persian Consul, an American Vice-Consul, and Belgian, Norwegian, and Spanish Representatives. History. —Pre-Mohammedan Baghdad is of no historical impor tance, though remains of a quay have been found which show that there was a settlement here in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. The town was founded as a great city in a. d . 762 by the second Caliph of the Abbasid line, Mansur. He established on the r. bank a great town which he called Bar es-Salam, 4 the Home of Peacebut the older name of the site, Baghdad, prevailed. This 'Round City', which lay N. of the present W. town and extended nearly as far as Kazimain, was for a while the capital of the whole Moslem Empire and was the centre of an imperial road-system. A second palace was built for his son, Mahdi, on the 1. bank. The city reached the zenith of its prosperity in the Caliphate of Harun er-Rashid at the end of the eighth century. After his death the 'Round City' suffered in the consequent civil wars, and in a. d . 836 was deprived of its position as capital of the Moslem world by the removal of the Caliph's court to Samarra. In a.d . 892 the Caliph Mu'tadid estab lished the capital at Baghdad, but preferred the eastern bank, and from this time onward the ' Round City' was gradually more and more eclipsed, and there are now no traces of it. From the tenth century onwards the Baghdad Caliphs, although still recognized in most Mohammedan countries as the religious heads of the Moslem faith, gradually lost the greater part of their political power, and Baghdad in consequence was on the way to becoming little more than a provincial capital; at the close of the twelfth century the W. city is described as being almost in ruins, while the E. town contained large uninhabited spaces. In 1258 Mongols under a grandson of the great Jengiz took and plundered the city : the Abbasid dynasty was extinguished and the religious importance of Baghdad passed away. These Mongols retained possession of the town until ousted at theBAGHDAD 383 end of the fourteenth century by Tatars under Timur Lang. In the fifteenth century it passed from the possession of one Mongol horde to another until the Persians occupied it in a. d . 1508. Thence forward its possession was disputed by Persians and Turks until it was finally taken by the latter under Murad IV in 1638. From the first part of the eighteenth to the first part of the nineteenth century it was the capital of a practically independent but from that time the authority of Constantinople was reasserted. Till 1884 the Baghdad Vilayet comprised the whole of Turkish Irak, but since then the southern portion has been separately established as the Vilayet of Basra. Kazimain (called Kazimiyeh by the Turks and known also as Imam Musa), on the r. bank of the Tigris about 3 m. from Baghdad. Pop. about 8,000. Bridge of 21 boats, carrying road to Mo'adhdham, which is about 1^ m. E. of bridge, joins road to Baghdad—Samarra. Horse-tramway to Baghdad (for routes see under Baghdad). All the inhabitants are Mohammedans, and about seven-eighths are Shiahs, 1,000 being Persians : 200 (1908) British subjects, Indian or of Indian descent. . The town has grown up round the sanctuary, where are buried the seventh and ninth Shiah Imams: there is a large and magnificent Shiah mosque. Pilgrims passing from Samarra to Nejef stop here to pay their respects to the shrine, and in the cold weather largely increase the population. It is an unhealthy place, partly owing to ' the passage through it of nearly all the Shiah corpses sent from Persia to be buried at the holy places of Nejef and Kerbela. Ophthalmic and venereal diseases are prevalent. Kazimain is the capital of the Kazimain of the of Baghdad: the Kaza includes the country S. of Baghdad from the Tigris to the Euphrates. Mo'adlidham (also called A'Dhamlyeh), on the 1. bank of the Tigris about 2 m. from Baghdad Citadel. Pop. about 2,000. Bridge of 21 boats, carrying road to Kazimain. A short distance E. of the town is Boute 25 a (ii), see vol. iii, p. 144. The road to Baghdad is un- metalled and very rough : hackney carnages and omnibuses drawn by four mules ply between Mo'adhdham and Baghdad. For the important tanneries of Mo'adhdham see under Baghdad above : there are market-gardens here and a small bazaar. The inhabitants are almost all Sunnis : some good houses on the river bank are the villas of wealthy inhabitants of Baghdad. The town owes its importance mainly to the tomb of Abu Hanifa, a shrine with a tiled dome. He was a historian and contemporary384 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS of the Caliph Manstir (second half of the eighth century), and founder of one of the four orthodox Sunni sects. The office of of this shrine is hereditary in a local family. Mo'adhdham is the head-quarters of a in the Baghdad Kaza, and is the residence of a Mudir. BASRA. On the r. bank of the Shatt el-'Arab, 69| m. by river from the Persian Gulf. Pop., town and suburbs, 80,000 (Con sular report, 1914). Wireless station, P.O., T. (Fao—Basra) now (1915) connected with Mohammareh across the river. Before the war there were two lines from Basra to Baghdad: Kurna and Kut el-Amara, (b) via Nasirlyeh and Hilla.

(iii) To Mohammareh. (See 3.) (iv) To Hawizeh and Dizfal. (See 7.) (v) To Ka'il. (See under Rou 24.) General Description. —The main part of the town (Basra proper) lies about 2 m. back from the river, from which the tops of its minarets are visible. Along the river front are a number of large private houses, some of which belong to Europeans, the offices, sheds, and wharves of various firms, the late British and German Consulates, and the Turkish custom-house. The German Consulate lay about m., and the British Consulate about 1 m., above Khorah Creek. The premises of Messrs. Lynch lie immediately below the former British Consulate. Two large creeks, the Nahr Ashar and the Nahr Khandaq, leave the r. bank of the river 400 and 1,100 yds. respectively above the British Consulate. They run in a general SSW. direction for about 3 m. Their width is about 50 yds. at the entrance, and gradually diminishes. The mouth of the Nahr Ashar, which leads to the main town, is marked by the large Turkish custom-house which is situated on its N. side, while to S. of it is a workshop, formerly belonging to the Da'irat es-Samyeh, in which there were a few machine-tools, and where small castings could be made and ordinary engineering repairsBAGHDAD—BASRA 885 executed. Immediately opposite the Turkish custom-house on the 1. bank of the Shatt el-Arab is the former Turkish Marine Hospital. On the spit between the Ashar and Khandaq creeks, called Dob, a little way back from the Shatt el-Arab, is the large suburb of Maqam or Ashar, the former name being that by which it is generally known, while the latter is that given to it by the Turks. Ashar suburb is approached by the creek of the same name, on the n. bank of which it lies. It contains shops, cafes, and a considerable popula tion. On the SE. side of this suburb the Ashar Creek is crossed by a wooden bridge passable for vehicles: on the NW. side towards the Khandaq Creek lie the former Turkish barracks. The Khandaq Creek in the neighbourhood of its mouth is the centre of the grain trade. It is lined with stores and depots, and many and other sailing craft lie moored at its entrance. At f m. up the creek, on its n. bank, is a dry dock which belonged to the es-Sanlyeh. Passenger hellams ply on the Ashar Creek from the Shatt el-Arab to the main town, and there is also a road for vehicles (the Strand) along its S. bank. Along this road are numerous large houses belonging to Europeans or natives. On the outskirts of Basra proper, and close to the Ashar Creek, is the serai or principal group of Government buildings. The main town, which stretches up the Ashar Creek for about 1 m. to the bridge called the Jisr el-Ghurban, was before the war unlighted, unpaved, and notoriously insanitary. The main bazaar runs near the Ashar Creek southwards through the busiest part of the town to a suburb called Mishraq: it is about | m. long, and is built of brick and roofed all the way. At the N. end are a few shops which deal in European commodities. In Mishraq is the mosque of Sheikh Abdallah Bash A'yan; from the minaret a good view can be obtained of the town and surrounding palm-groves. Just below the Jisr el-Ghurban mentioned above are some of the best native residential houses, occupied by officials and rich merchants. The walls and gates of the town proper, which till recently existed in a dilapidated state, have now practically disappeared. The better houses in the residential quarters are mostly built of soft, yellow burnt brick, but timber is often used for the upper stories. The low ground between Basra and Zobeir is protected against floods from the Euphrates by the Sha'aibeh (built 1915-16), which starts at Magil and runs for about 10^ m. to the edge of the high ground E. of the tomb of Imam Anas. It is 6-|-8 ft. high and 8-10 ft. wide on top. At about 1 m. from Magil another new hund diverges S. to the neighbourhood of the Zobeir gate (about 3 m.), MES. II386 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS continuing thence towards the high ground at Zobeir. The Nasi- nyeh railway goes along it. Anchorage and Landing. —See Hou I A, m. 69|. Climate and Hygiene.- —In December and January the weather at Basra is cold, sometimes with frost at night. The months of July, August, and September are intensely hot, and the population lives largely in underground rooms. The rest of the year resembles the spring and summer of Southern Europe. The greatest heat expe rienced in summer is ordinarily about 112° F., and in winter the thermometer falls to 35° or lower. The hottest weather is generally in July, the coldest in January. The climate is injurious in summer and malaria prevails all the year round. An outbreak of bubonic plague occurred in 1910, and epidemics of cholera in 1910 and 1911. Before the present war the native population used the Ashar Creek for drinking-water and also as a sewer. Supplies and Com/nemJ.—Wheat, barley, and rice are locally available in normal times. The amounts vary in different years. Bates are abundant, especially in September. Vegetables, poor in quality, can be procured at Zobeir. Fruit is plentiful. Beef is scanty and poor in qualityj but sheep are numerous. The best water is from the open stream of the Shatt el-Arab, but this is not wholesome owing to drainage from swampy areas. The water from the Ashar Canal is drunk by the poorer classes, but as they are said to use the canal as ^ wash-tub, bath, dustbin, and cesspool' it had better be avoided. Norton tube-wells would be useful at any camps away from the river, and their use was recommended after the 1857 expedition to Mohammareh (p. 414). Watering animals in the river is difficult as the banks are shelving and muddy. Pumps with a length of pipe to run the water into troughs should be used. Date-trees are difficult to fell and too valuable for fuel. A small puckly shrub called shoh grows outside the town. Coal is stored for nver steamers; average stock with Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., about 800 tons. For tiansport at Basra in normal times 200 camels could be obtained (a large number could also probably be secured from Zobeir), 200 donkeys,^ and 1,000 horses, including 200 pack-horses. Basra, besides haying a local trade in dates and grain, is the port^ oi Baghdad, which is the chief distributing centre in Mesopo- tamia. Practically all goods consigned to the interior are included m the shipping returns of Basra, whose imports and exports con stitute the foreign trade of Irak and to some extent of Western(rn) BASRA 887 Persia also. Under the Caliphates Basra was a clearing-house where traders from Africa, India, and the Far East met to transact business with the Moslem world and with Europe. The importance of Basra began to decline with the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, and became still less when the Suez Canal was opened. At the present time it shows signs of recovery, although it was adversely affected by the political and economic crisis through which Turkey passed in 1913, aggravated by severe agricultural depression consequent on the poor grain crops of that year. In 1911 the total value of imports into the port of Basra was £2855 677, that of exports £2,525,847. In 1912 imports were valued at £2,637,809, and exports at £3,246,560. In 1913 the value of imports was £3,899,273, that of exports £1,939,259, In these figures is included the value of goods imported to or exported from Baghdad by way of Basra. It will b© sggii thcit in 1911 tliGrG wcis till gxcgss of impoits ovgi exports of about £330,000 ; in 1912, an gxcgss of Gxports ovor imports of about &lt;£608,000 ; and in 1913, owing to tho failuro of tho CGroal crops and to the largG imports in connGxion with tho Baghdad Kail- way, an gxcgss of imports oyor Gxports of about £1,960,000. Tho principal imports were cotton goods, woollon cloths, loaf and crystal sugar, date-box wood and planks, yarn and twist, machinory, coffee and tea, copper, iron and stGGl (for the Baghdad Railway), petroleum, gunnies. In 1913, whon tho rico crop failed, much rice was imported from India. The principal exports were dates, cereals (barley, wheat, and rice: very variable), seeds, wool, ghi, liquorice, opium (from Persia), gall- nuts (from Kurdistan), hides and skins, carpets, horses (from Arabia). Dates are tho most valuablo Gxport, and aro sont chiofly to England and America. The export of liquorice is also important. The root, which grows especially on the Tigris banks, is collected in the winter months, when it contains most juice, and, after being weighed and cured at the receiving stations, it is forwarded to Basra, where it is baled by hydraulic power. The export of cereals in the three years 1911-13 varied from 231,171 tons in a good year (1912) to 44,283 tons in 1913, when the harvest was bad. The cereal exported in the largest quantities is barley. See further vol. i, chap. xii. The date trade supplies the only local export of any importance, most of the business done being in the way of agency or forwarding. The Euphrates valley as far as Hilla probably draws directly on Basra for its imported commodities, but this is perhaps the limit of the importance of Basra as a pivot of internal trado* Tho key to b b 2388 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Baghdad trade is to be found in the ocean trade prevailing at Basra and the river freights between Basra and Baghdad. British interests in Basra date from the establishment of the English Factory by the East India Company more than 150 years ago. In 1913 the number of steam vessels of all nationalities that entered and cleared the port of Basra was 195, with a net tonnage of 327,913, and of these 163 were British, having a net tonnage of 254,714, The number of sailing vessels was 250 (19,026 tons), of which 137 were British (11,595 tons). Despite its commercial importance the Turkish Government had not constructed wharves or pontoons at Basra, leaving ships to load and unload by means of lighters. The following lines of ocean steamers called regularly at Basra :— The British India Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. The Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Co., Ltd. The Strick Line. Messrs. Marcus Samuel &amp; Co. Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. The Arab Steamers, Ltd. The Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. Haji Sultan Ali Shustari Line. The Hamburg-Amerika Line. The Russian Steamship Navigation Co. Numerous steamers were chartered annually for the export of dates at harvests. During the years preceding the present war the following lines of river-steamers navigated the Shatt el-Arab and Tigris up to Baghdad:— The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch Bros.). The Idarah Nahriyah, a Turkish company. .These companies were amalgamated in 1914 under the name ' Mackay, Lynch &amp; Co.' Trade on the Tigris was largely carried on in sailing vessels (maheilehs). For these craft see vol. i, p. 166. The European firms with offices at Basra are :— Messrs. Lynch Bros. (Merchants: carrying-trade on the Tigris and Karun). Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. (Merchants: importers and exporters: agents for the British India Steam Navigation Co. and Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Lines). Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. (Merchants : importers and exporters, shipowners : agents for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company).BASRA 889 Messrs. MacAndrew, Forbes &amp; Co. (American firm ; exporters of liquorice). „ , . n Basra Trading Company (British firm; exporters of dates and grain). Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. (German firm ; agents tor liamburg- Amerika Line). Eussian Steamship and Trading Company, of Odessa, had an agency here. £ Messrs. Asfar &amp; Co. are an important native Christian firm. There is a branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Basra. Inhabitants. —The population is mainly composed of sedentary Arabs. There are also several thousand Persians, a considerable Jewish settlement, and a small colony of resident Indians. Negroes of servile origin are fairly numerous. In 1913 there was a floating population of the labouring class which numbered some 10,000 persons, variously engaged in the grain-trade of the port. The Sunni and Shiah sects are said to be about equally balanced in numbers. The few Indian Mohammedans are mostly Sunnis. Some of the wealthiest merchants are Jews. Administration and Authorities. —Basra town was the head-quarters of the Turkish Vilayet of the same name, and the seat of a Vali. It also formed a Nahiye in the Basra The latter area was under the direct charge of the Vali. The city was nominally under a powerless and inefficient municipal council. The Da'irat had offices here, including a Mamur and subordinate staff, who control the Shatt el-'Arab properties. There was a local Sanlyeh committee. The principal offices of the navigation branchy of this department were established here under a director subordinate to the central committee in Baghdad. There was a Mudir of customs under the Director-General of Customs at Baghdad. Shipping and river conservancy were in the hands of a harbour-master. The Turkish garrison consisted normally of two battalions of infantry, with some artillery and a detachment of engineers. A naval commodore was stationed here in command of two gun boats. One of the most important personages in Basra before the war was the unscrupulous Seyyid Talib Bey who had great influence among the Arabs of the town. He is said to have terrorized Basra with a band of armed men. In 1914 there were at Basra British, French, Russian, American, Dutch, Persian, and German consuls. History. —Old Basra, the ruins of which lie about 8 m. SW. by W. of the modern town, and extend for about 3 m. in the same direction390 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS up to the walls of Zobeir, was founded by the Caliph Omar in a. d. 638. In the Middle Ages Old Basra was famous as a seat of learning and as the port for the sea-borne commerce between the flourishing Mesopotamia of the Caliphate and the countries of the Farther East. (The Arabian Nights make Sinbad the Sailor start from Basra on his voyages.) The city was connected with the Shatt el-Arab by the much more ancient town of Ubullah, which is believed to have stood on the site of the present Maqam. Basra suffered from the rapid decline of Mesopotamian prosperity due to the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The old city was eventually abandoned, and New Basra took its place. In the seventeenth century Basra was occasionally visited by English merchants engaged in the Indian trade. In 1668 Basra (on its present site) was conquered by the Turks, and, except for short intervals in the eighteenth century when it was held first by Persians and then by Muntefiq Arabs, it remained in their hands till 1914. Under the Muntefiq Arabs the population of Basra had sunk to a few thousands. The town apparently owed its revival mainly to the development of trade with British India in the nineteenth century: a development made possible by the policing of the Persian Gulf by the British Government, and by its influence in Irak. In recent years the advantages and disadvantages of Basra as a possible terminus for the Baghdad Railway have been under consideration. It was at first believed that the commercial value of its position would be largely discounted by the cost of maintaining a depth of water on the Shatt el-Arab bar sufficient to allow large ocean-going steamers to enter the river at any time. It has lately been reported, however, that at a moderate outlay the bar could be dredged so as to allow the passage of vessels drawing 25-26 ft. BUEiUJIRD.

(See R 11 g.)BASEA— BUEUJIRD—DIWANIYEH 891 General Description. —-Burujird is situated in the fertile plain of Silakhor on the river Tahlj, a tributary of the Dizful river, and is enveloped in gardens with picturesque summer-houses. There are many thriving villages on the hills above the town, Burujird was formerly surrounded by walls and a ditch, but the walls have for the most part fallen, and the ditch is dry and under cultivation. Many houses are ruined. Supplies and Commerce. —The bazaars, from which the caravan serais are entered, are small. The water-supply seems to be un limited throughout the valley, and being very near the surface could be easily procured even in dry years. Grapes and melons are plentiful, and all kinds of supplies are to be obtained in the bazaars. The town had formerly a large manufacture of printed cotton goods, but this has declined. Cotton is grown in the neighbourhood. Carpets, felts, and the uppers of native shoes are mentioned as other manufactures, and opium, almonds, and gum tragacanth are exported. The town is an important road-centre, and under settled conditions should be capable of large commercial development. History.—In the years preceding the war Burujird was almost continually in a state of unrest. In January 1911 the Lurs rose against the governor-general because he had executed a relative of their chiefs. In 1911 the place was the scene of some fighting during Salar ed-Dauleh's rebellion. Administration. —As the capital of a province Burujird has been the seat of a governor-general, but the province has sometimes been united with that of Luristan. A regiment of infantry (nominally 1,000 men, probably about 200-300 in fact) is quartered here in normal times, with a few gunners, and it has been reported that there are six Austrian brass guns and 700 muzzle-loading muskets. The town is the place of embodiment of the Savareh-i-Bakhtiyari and Yar Ahmadi, nominally 1,000 strong, but it is doubtful if they actually number 200. DIWANIYEH.

On the Hilla Branch of the Euphrates, 11 m. by river below the bifurcation. Pop. (1908) about 30,000. P.O. T. (Basra— Hilla—Baghdad line : branch to Tawarlj—Kerbela). Bridge of 15 boats. River Routes. —For communication by Euphrates with places above and below Hilla see Boutes IV A, B, C, D. Land Routes.— (i) To Samaweh. via Diwaniyeh. (See Iloute 14.) (ii) To Nejef. (See Route 21 b.) (hi) To Kerbela via Tawanj. (See Route 15.) (iv) To Baghdad. (See Route 21 b.) (v) To Bogheileh. (See Route 20.) General Description. —Hilla stands among date-groves on both banks of the river, which is here about 100 yds. wide. Before the construction of the new barrage the channel at Hilla was sometimes entirely dry in the l.w. season. The portion of the town on the r. bank is surrounded by a strong brick wall, 16 ft. high, with towers at intervals, now much out of repair. There is no town-wall on the 1. bank, but several walled date-gardens. The principal part of the town (called Shamiyeh as lying nearer the desert) stands on the r. bank: here are the barracks, well built of Babylonian bricks, forming the back of a large open square which fronts the river at the boat-bridge. The serai consists of a large block of buildings in good repair a little N. of the barracks. Other noticeable buildings in this quarter are a tall minaret in the centre and a large mosque outside the NW. gate on the road to Kerbela. Both this and the E. quarter (called Jezlreh, being situated in Mesopotamia) are largely constructed of bricks brought from the site of Babylon. Supplies and Commerce, — The steady decline in the agricultural prosperity of Hilla, due to the failure of this arm of the river, makes it difficult to estimate local supplies, but in 1908 it was calculated that under favourable conditions supplies could be collected in a week as follows : 400 tons of wheat, 600 tons of barley, 100 tons of rice, 1,000 oxen and cows, 600 buffaloes, 300 horses, 1,000 donkeys, 50 mules, 700 camels, 5,000 sheep. Besides barley and wheat, dates and ghi were then being exported. Manchester goods, sugar, and coffee were imported. Arab saddles and felt used for rugs and horse- furniture were manufactured. There was a large covered bazaar con-FELLtJJEH—HILLA—KERBELA 895 taining 2,000 shops : there were 120 grain stores, 18 khans, and a warehouse for the storage of petroleum. Before the construc tion of the new Hindiyeh Barrage, the people of Hilla had in l.w. to obtain drinking-water by digging holes in the river-bed to an average depth of 3 ft. Inhabitants. —Of the inhabitants more than three-fourths are Shiah Arabs: the remainder are mostly Sunnis. There are 700 or 800 Persians, a few Oriental Christians, and Punjabi Indians. Administration and Authorities. —Hilla is head-quarters of a in the Sanjaq of Diwaniyeh in the of Baghdad, with the usual officials. It was, after Baghdad and Basra, the most important Turkish military station in Irak, and was a centre from which the Turks attempted to control the tribes of the surrounding marshes and deserts. EERBELA. The greatest of the Shiah centres of pilgrimage, on the edge of the Syrian desert, about 55 m. SSW. of Baghdad, and about 20 m. W. of the Hindiyeh arm of the Euphrates. Pop. perhaps about 50,000 (exclusive of a large floating population). P.O. T. (before the War there was communication with Baghdad and Basra via Hilla, and by a branch line with Nejef). Routes.— (i) To Baghdad. (See Bout 21 a.) (ii) To Hilla. (See Route 15.) (hi) To Nejef. (See Route 21 a.) (iv) To Ramadiyeh. (See Eonte 17.) General Description. —The town stands on the Huseiniyeh Canal, which flows from the Euphrates. The canal bifurcates at the NW. corner of the city, and of its two arms one runs off to the NW., and the other circles round the western side of the city. At the bifurcation the Huseiniyeh is spanned by a curious double bridge, passable for carts. On the N., S., and E. Kerbela is surrounded by cultivated lands, fruit gardens, and date-groves; and about 2 m. to the SE. begins the marsh known as the Ain el- Huseiniyeh, formed by water from the Huseiniyeh Canal and the Hindiyeh. On the W. the desert extends almost to the walls of the town. No general view of Kerbela can be obtained except from the towers and minarets of the Shiah shrines, which are not accessible to Europeans. The site of the town is on the whole level, but the ground is somewhat higher towards the NW. corner. Kerbela consists of an old town on the N., still walled on its eastern,396 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS northern, and western sides, but open towards the S.—the side on which the new town adjoins it. The old town is crowded and irregularly built; the new is well laid out, with a broad main street running from N. to S., and is comparatively clean. A mile or more to the S. of the new town is the large mansion of a Punjabi Indian's family; it is known as Afzal Khan's Fort, The walls of the old town are of brick, 20-30 ft. high, with towers projecting at intervals as bastions. There are two tiers with loopholes, and in the inside is a banquette, supported by arches, which affords standing-room for the defenders of the upper tier. The perimeter of the walls is about 2 m. They are pierced by 5 gates, and about 25 towers still re main ; but the whole work is now in bad repair. Shrines. —The chief of the shrines which make Kerbela a centre of pilgrimage for the whole Shiah world is that of Husein, the son of Ali, which stands in the old town towards its western end. The interior is not accessible to Christians, but is known to consist of a large outer court, called the Sahn, with 7 gates, and of the Haram, or sanctuary proper, a building with a gilded dome flanked by two tall gilded minarets. A yet larger minaret of tile-work rises from one corner of the Sahn, and near it is a smaller Sahn thrown out from the Great Court. The tomb of Husein is in the Haram. The tomb of Abbas, half-brother of Husein, lies E. of Husein's tomb, nearer to the centre of the town : it has a dome of glazed brick and gilded minarets. Both the tomb of Husein and that of Abbas have treasuries, popularly supposed to contain vast wealth. Less important shrines are the Kheimehgah, a small building W. of Husein's tomb, marking the site of Husein's tent before the battle in which he was killed ; the tomb of Aun, Husein's nephew, 7 m. of Kerbela, on the road to Museyib ; and that of Hurr, who deserted to Husein from the enemy, 3i m. to the NW. Supplies and Commerce. —The bazaars are well provided with supplies of all kinds. The agricultural and garden produce of the environs is large, the lands along the canal being well cultivated, while the gardens near the city are extensive and productive. There is usually a large surplus of dates for export. The water-supply is ordinarily from the canal, or, when that fails, from wells, numbers of which are sunk in the canal bed. The canal supply used to be uncertain, but the construction of the Hindiyeh Barrage should remove this defect. The well-water is brackish. Kerbela is not a good place for the collection of transport. Mules cannot easily be got, and camels are not obtainable, except in autumn when the Bedouin are in the vicinity. Some twenty shops dealt in European wares. There was a con-KERBELA—KHUERAMABAD 897 siderable trade, the main exports being dates, skins and hides, wool and tobacco, as well as consecrated articles such as rosaries, praying tablets, &amp;c. The chief imports were piece-goods, carpets, petroleum, candles, sugar, spices, coffee, and tea. Inhabitants. —Of the fixed population three-fourths at least are Persian (or Baluchi), and almost the whole of the remainder Arabs. There are a few Turks and Jews, and about 1,200 British Indians. The Moslem population is almost entirely Shiah, and the are a numerous and influential body, though Kerbela is not so important as Nejef as a centre of Shiah culture and learning. A number of residents in Kerbela received annuities from the Indian Government, which was trustee for some endowments made by British Indians. The floating population consists of Shiah pilgrims and their attendants, who come in thousands every year, mainly in the cold weather. Many bring with them the corpses of relatives for burial; many come that they themselves may die and be buried in this holy spot. In normal times most of the pilgrims came from Persia and India. ■ Administration and Authorities. —Kerbela is the head-quarters of a Scmjaq and Kasa in the Vilayet of Baghdad. In addition to the Mutessarif, a Mudir of the Sanitary Department and a Mamur of the Tobacco Regie used to be stationed here. The military garrison consisted nominally of one regular battalion, but there used rarely to be more than 240 men actually in the city, where they were quartered in a hired caravanserai. A British vice-consul (an Indian) and a representative of the Persian Government were maintained here before the war. History. —The battle in which Husein, the son of Ali, was slain by the troops of the Caliph Yazid was fought in 680 a. i). To this event Kerbela owes its importance, for the martyrdom of Husein has exercised perhaps a more profound influence on Shiah religious feeling than any other event in the history of Islam. Kerbela has come to be regarded as the holiest of all the Shiah holy places. KHURIIAMABAD. The capital of Luristan, Persia. Alt. variously estimated from 3,875 to 4,700 ft. Pop. variously esti mated from 2,000 upwards: perhaps about 6,000. T. Routes.— To Burujird. (See Boute 11 g.) To Isfahan. (See Eoutes in P vol. iii. Route 83, &amp;c.)398 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS To Dizful. (See Routes 11 a, b.) To Deh Bala. (See Eoute lid.) To Kirmanshah. (See Eoute lie.) General Description. —The town is situated on the r. bank of the Kashgan river or Ab-i-Khurramabad, the ruins of a former city (see History, below) lying on the 1. bank. The river here is broad and usually shallow, and fordable everywhere, but at times it carries a large volume of water. A steep isolated rock above the town is crowned by the ruined Diz-i-Siyeh (black castle). The town is poorly built, with houses mainly of mud. It is of no military strength. There is a camping-ground, suitable for a brigade, W. of the town. Climate. —The summer is very hot, and from June to September the inhabitants are away on the hills. Heavy rains fall in October, and the winter is severe, with a considerable fall of snow. The transition from winter to summer is rapid. Supplies and Commerce. —The bazaar is poor and ill-supplied, and the surrounding country, though fertile, is insufficiently cultivated with a little rice, wheat, and barley. Fruit and vegetables, however, are abundant in summer. Khurramabad is a wool-mart for the Lurs, but has little industry. History. —The site on the 1. bank has been occupied from very early times. A high circular brick tower, an aqueduct, and a ruined bridge are among the ancient remains. When the Arabs overran Persia Khurramabad became a point of strategic importance. From about 1100 to 1600 it was the capital of the Atabegs of Luristan. Administration. —The town is the seat of the Governor of Luristan, whose residence is at the foot of the castle walls. KIPL. On the 1. bank of the Hindiyeh arm of the Euphrates, immediately above the bifurcation of the Kufeh and Shamiyeh chan nels. Pop. about 2,000. T.L. Nejef—Hilla passes the town. Ferry.

(See Route 21 b.) General Description. —Kifi is surrounded on three sides by creeks from the river, which are not often more than 3 or 5 ft. deep ; some of them extend for several miles. At h.w. the village is surrounded by floods, and is then connected with the mainland only by a winding(JD3) KHUEKAMABAD—KIPL—KIEMANSHAH 399 embankment about 3 ft. broad and ^ m. long. In 1908 the town consisted of about 70 houses of masonry and a large number of reed and mud huts: the village is filthy. It was reported in 1908 that there was an excellent landmark to all the country-side in a solitary minaret, which became visible on the road a few miles after leaving Nejef, but it was in an insecure condition. The shrine of Ezekiel stands in the middle of the village in a courtyard surrounded by a wall within which most of the Jews of Kifl live. Supplies and Commerce. —There is some cultivation : a good many date plantations, especially on the E. side of the Shamiyeh Channel. Trade is chiefly with Hilla town and Tawarlj (Hindiyeh). There is a bazaar. Inhabitants. —About 200 are Jews, the remainder Arabs, Some of the Shiah pilgrims who pass between Kerbela and Nejef come by water and stop here, but the place is mainly important as the resort of Jewish pilgrims, who visit the tomb of Hizqil or Ezekiel, mainly at Pentecost. Many Jewish corpses are sent from a distance for interment. Administration and Authorities. —Kifi is the head-quarters of a NaJiiye in the Kaza of Hindiyeh. KIRMANSHAH. The capital of the province of Kirmanshah, Persia, which lies to the N. of Luristan. Alt. 5,100 ft. Pop. estimated from 40,000 upwards; one authority gives 60,000 as a minimum, having regard to the excessive crowding of the Kurdish inhabitants. P.O. T. (Baghdad—Teheran line). Routes.— To Senna. (See Routes in Persia vol. ii, Route 78, &amp;c.) To Hamadan. (See 11antes in vol. ii, Koutes 71, 84.) To Khurramabad. (See Route 11 e.) To Kut el-Amara. (See Route9.) To Baghdad. (See vol. iii of this handbook. 28 a, b.) To Suleimaniyeh. (See vol. iii of this handbook. 35.) General Description. —Kirmanshah is situated on an undulating plain some 30 m. long from E. to W. and 6 m. broad, with many small villages. Fine gardens lie to the S. and N. of the town. Kirmanshah was formerly walled, but the fortifications have so far decayed that the town is now open, and the gates, though their names survive in common use, have disappeared. The streets are mostly narrow and tortuous, and the houses of the common people are mean buildings of mud, but there are some comfortable houses400 GAZETTEEE OF TOWNS of merchants, and some fair public buildings, a governor's palace, barracks, arsenal, &amp;c. Climate and Hygiene. —The climate in summer is mild, but as a rule not excessively hot, though sometimes the inhabitants with draw to the hills at that season. The winter is very cold, but there is not very much snow. The climate, being dry, is healthy. Fever, small-pox, and diphtheria, however, are not uncommon, and in recent years cholera, and, earlier, plague, have occurred. The water- supply is unsatisfactory (see below). Supplies and Commerce. —The bazaar is large and well stocked, and all supplies are available in quantity. The water-supply is ample, but it runs from house to house, and is contaminated : it is also heavy and indigestible, and is liable to cause diarrhoea and dysentery. Kirmanshah is an important trading-centre, and has a customs-station, which, under Belgian direction from 1899, has yielded largely-increasing returns. This station is the centre for the administration of a number of others along the frontier, along which armed guards are maintained to prevent smuggling. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are principally Kurds, and the authority of their chiefs, some of whom reside in the town, is con siderable both here and in the neighbourhood. The most common language is Kurdish, but as it is spoken here many Persian words are mixed with it. The Persian nobles in the town have little influence. There are a few Ottoman Jews, in whose hands is most of the foreign import and export trade. There are commercial agents representing merchants of Baghdad, Hamadan, Isfahan, Kashan, Yezd, and other places. The inhabitants are mostly of the Shiah sect. Large numbers of pilgrims pass through the town on their way to or from Kerbela, Nejef, and Kazimain. History. —Kirmanshah dates from the later part of the fourth century, but the earliest town probably did not occupy the present site. The place was the scene of much fighting in 1770-80, when the governor, Mirza Mohammed Taki, proclaimed himself indepen dent. About the close of the nineteenth century the governor, Ala ed-Dauleh, had the province well under control, and he was respon sible for many improvements in the town. In 1911 began the rebellion ot Salar ed-Dauleh, brother of the ex-Shah Mohammed Ali, and in and after that year Kirmanshah was more than once occupied and reoccupied by his forces and by government troops. Administration. —The town is the seat of the governor of the province of Kirmanshah, with the customary staff and bodyguard. There is a Turkish consulate-general, and British and Russian consulates were established in 1904.KIRMANSHAH—KOWEIT 401 KOWEIT. On the NW. shore of the Persian Gulf, about T 80 m. SSE. of Basra. Pop. 30,000 to 40,000. Other estimates place the number somewhat higher. 3,000 houses, or rather more. Routes.— To Zobeir and Umm Qasr. (See 23 c and d.) To Boreidah. (See Boute 24 a (i).) To Hofuf and Qatif. (See R 24 b.) General Description. —The town lies on a small projection or tongue of land, which terminates in Ras 'Ajuzeh, on the southern side of a great bay of the same name as the town. The bay is 20 m. long E. and W., and has a maximum breadth of 10 m. N. and S., in the greater part of which there is anchorage, with good holding ground. In a N. wind there is a considerable sea in the southern part of the bay, but not enough to distress a large vessel. The depths of the harbour are from 10 to 16 fathoms off the Eas el-Ardh ; from 5 to 9 fathoms off Ras Ajuzeh ; 4^ to 5 fathoms northward of Kas 'Usheirij ; and from 6^ to 6 fathoms in Dohat Kadhimeh, shoaling to 4 fathoms near the narrows at its head. The town extends about 1 m. along the beach. It is provided with numerous substantial stone breakwaters which form tidal harbours for native craft. The beach dries out to a considerable distance, and landing when the tide is out is not a pleasant operation ; ponies are taken out and are mounted from the boat; failing which it would be necessary to wade a long way. At high water the sea washes up to the front row of houses, and landing from boats on any of the sea-walls is easy. The site of the town is generally flat, but the SW. quarter stands rather higher than the rest, and has steep lanes leading up to it from the beach. The streets are irregular and winding, and many are blind alleys. Most houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to the parapet-wall round the roof. The town is comparatively clean, well built, and prosperous in appearance, with many solid stone houses, others being built of sun- dried brick. The main bazaar is broad and open, clean and busy. It lies about the middle of the town at right angles to the sea. During the last forty years the town has completely outgrown its old walls. On the S. side there has grown up a long suburb called Murqab, which is the point of arrival and departure for the caravans trading between Koweit and the interior. Here may be seen strings of camels; and here, too, the Bedouin mostly congregate, camp, and 'transact their business, as, if armed, they are not allowed in the town. There are some 500 shops, 3 caravanserais, 6 coffee-houses, 3 schools, and 20-30 mosques, 4 of which are or Friday congregational mosques. There are also numerous warehouses and stores. mes&gt; ii. /i f»402 GAZETTEEK OF TOWNS There has been a British Eesidency at Koweit for some years. Climate and Hygiene. —The climate of Koweit is said to compare favourably with that of most Persian Gulf ports. It has been stated that in December and January the climate is perfect, bracing in the mornings and evenings, and never unpleasantly hot. On the other hand, a 1908 Eeport says that it is sometimes bitterly cold in winter, especially when a Shmnal (N. wind) is blowing. In summer the prevailing wind which blows from the NW. is somewhat tempered by crossing 10 m. of water in the bay, and the clean desert sand cools down rapidly at night. The air, however, except in a breeze, is laden with vile odours, chiefly that of fish-oil. Fever is practically unknown, and dysentery and ophthalmia are rare. The sanitary system is rudimentary, the sewage being deposited in large, open public cesspools in the various quarters. Supplies and Commerce. —Water, reported to be of indifferent quality, is obtained from the following sources :— (1) Scattered wells SW. of the town, and 4,000 to 5,000 yds. ENE. of Bandar Showeikh. Most of the water for the town is got from these wells. (2) Wells with abundance of water about 3 m. SSE. of Koweit. (3) Wells at Eas 'Ajuzeh, E. of the town. (4) Wells at Jahrah. Water is also brought from the Shatt el-'Arab, and a tank steamer has recently been acquired by the Sheikh for this purpose. Better water, however, is procurable from the wells of Qasr es-Sirreh, 8 m. SSE. of Koweit, or from those of Mushrif, 2 m. E. of Qasr es-Sirreh. Forage and vegetables are mostly brought from Jahrah or imported from abroad. There is sparse grazing for herds of the Bedouin during the winter months and there is some pasture for camels, but otherwise the place has no agricultural resources. There are no date plantations or cultivated fields round Koweit. Most kinds of food-stuffs can in normal times be procured in the town. Koweit is the only port for the Jebel Shammar district of Central Arabia. The population is almost entirely engaged in pearl-diving, fishing, and the coastal trade. Some 500 boats are engaged in the pearl industry, their size varying from 30 to 300 tons. A large number of the pearl-fishers now visit the Ceylon pearl banks in winter. The fish weirs on the flat beach are very conspicuous. Most of the carrying trade is with the upper and western part of the Persian Gulf and the Shatt el-'Arab ; its ordinary limits are Qatif on the S. and Basra on the N., and the boats engaged in it are seldom absent from Koweit more than two months at a time. TheKOWEIT 403 (205; ■ w i sea -going cargo-boats number 30-40, some of them being of as much as 1000 tons. There are besides a number of small coasters. About 300 carpenters in Koweit gain a livelihood by boat-building. All the material is imported from India. The chief imports, in order of value, are arms and ammunition, rice, Indian and American piece-goods, tobacco, wet dates, wheat, coffee, barley, and sugar. It is reported that most of the rice, wheat, coffee, barley, and American piece-goods are re-exported to Nejd. Exports, in order of value, include tobacco, wheat, pearls, wet dates, and ghi. There is also a small export of lambskins to Russia via Baghdad, and a more important trade in horses to India. Juss is manufactured in a gypsiferous tract to the S. of the suburb of Murqab. As elsewhere in Arabia, the Maria Theresa dollar, real' (the value of which is about 1 rupee 8 annas), may be considered the standard medium of exchange, while Persian and Turkish copper coins are also met with. English sovereigns are occasionally met with, and the Indian rupee is accepted. Bills can be obtained on Basra, Bushire, and Bombay, and also, it is said, on Nejd. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are Mohamniedan (mostly Sunnis) and, like most Arabs, tolerant to others and not over-rigid to them selves. The strict Wahhabl faith is prescribed, and the efforts of Nejd have been uniformly unsuccessful in making proselytes. The great majority are Arabs belonging to the 'Atub, Hawazin, Kusheideh, Beni Khalid, 'Ajman, Dawasir, Anazeh, and Dhafrr tribes, besides Hasawlyeh from Hasa and Bahreinis from Bahrein. There are also about 1,000 Persians, some Jews and Jan a at, and about 4,000 negroes. There is no Indian colony (1908 Report). The Arab population is on the whole not of a robust type. The complexion of many is sickly. Administration and Authorities. —The administration is patriarchal. Hospitality is offered to all guests, who must, however, leave their arms at the gate. The Sheikh (who belongs to the 'Atub tribe) exercises political power and the judicial functions of a Punishment is rarely inflicted, and there seems to be but little governmental interference with the liberty of the subject in any respect, and to be little need for it. No tribute is or ever has been paid either to the Emir of Nejd or the Turkish Government. Nor is tribute exacted from other tribes. The Sheikh has a Customs Department, but no statistics are available. Koweit, in fact, under a succession of common-sense rulers, has become a thriving free-trade port. In December 1914 the Sheikh of Koweit adopted a special flag of his own. c c 2 I y I404 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS The boundaries of the Sheikh of Koweit's power follow roughly a line drawn from the Khor es-Sahlyeh, passing immediately S. of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jebel Sanam and the Batin depression; thence along the Batin to Hafar ; and from Hafar southwards so as to include Summam. On the S. the Sheikh's influence reaches as far as the N. border of the Radaif, and the boundary may be considered to run from Jebel Munlfeh on the coast to the Nu'eirlyeh hill at the N W, corner. The Koweit principality is about 190 m. from NNW. to SSE., and 160 m. from ENE. to WSW. It also includes the islands at the mouth of Koweit Bay. Koweit and district (within 10 m.) can supply perhaps 12,000 fighting-men. History. —■The chief importance of Koweit in history dates from 1871, when 'Abdallah ibn Eeisal, ruler of Nejd, appealed for assistance against his brother Sa'ud to Midhat Pasha, then Vali of Baghdad. Sa'ud had seized El-Qator and Qatlf and also some ships belonging to Koweit. As a result of a conference between Midhat Pasha and the Sheikh of Koweit it was decided to co-operate with 'Abdallah against Sa'ud. The latter was defeated, and according to the Turkish account the Sheikh placed himself under Turkish control, assumed the Ottoman flag, and by accepting the title of Pasha acknowledged henceforth a certain subjection to Turkey. According to the Koweit account the Sheikh was granted the title of Pasha in return for services rendered, at the same time receiving grants of land in the neighbourhood of Eao, and a grant of money which was paid regularly until 1898. ' From 187]. to 1897 the question of the sovex'eignty of Koweit arose in various forms, mainly on the general point of the repression of piracy on the Gulf Coast by British ships. In 1897 Sheikh Mobaraq failed in an endeavour to obtain from Turkey a recognition of independence, upon which he made a definite request for British protection. The British Government were at first disinclined to interfere, but in 1899 certain arrangements were entered into with the Sheikh when it was reported that a Russian railway concession in Koweit had been granted. Meanwhile the Sheikh had accepted the title of Kaimmakam from the Turkish Government, but this was explained as merely incidental to his possession of the Turkish property at Fao. Subsequently the Turks appointed a harbour- official, who was removed later as the result of a protest from the British Government. In 1901 the Sheikh attacked the Emir of Nejd, who appealed to the Ottoman Government, and Turkish troops would probably have been dispatched to Koweit had not the British Government announced'V. o KOWEIT—KUFEH 405 its determination to oppose by force any landing of troops, A few- weeks afterwards an official from Basra warned the Sheikh that he had better make his submission to the Turkish Government, but this action was disavowed, on representations of the British ambassador at Constantinople. A more peremptory summons was issued later in the same year, which resulted in the Sheikh stating that he would have no option but to comply unless assured of British support. The Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf received instructions to defend the town, but no attack was made, and again the Porte disavowed the action of its officials, though during 1903 it continued to occupy various more or less debatable points on the Koweit boundaries with small posts of troops, e.g. at Safwan, Bubayan Island, Umm Qasr, and Warbeh Island. Between 1903 and 1910 there was little open interference with the status quo, though the Young Turkish Government which came into power in 1908 tried unsuccessfully to detach the Sheikh by their promises from the British connexion. The attitude of His Majesty's Government with regard to the situation was stated by Sir E. Grey in the House of Commons on March 9, 1911, in a debate concerning the suggested Persian Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway. He said: 'We are not anxious to disturb the status in the Persian Gulf . . . but if the status quo is going to be disturbed by others then we must undoubtedly use our resources to maintain our position in the Persian Gulf. Part of the status quo is that we have entered into treaty obligations with the Sheikh of Koweit, and in any negotiations which there may be, or in any changes which may take place, it is an obligation of honour with us to see that our treaty obligations towards the Sheikh of Koweit in maintaining his position are fulfilled.' In 1914 this and other points of variance were on the point of being amicably settled. \ I EUFEH. On the 1. bank of the Kufeh Channel of the Hindiyeh arm of the Euphrates, and 7 m. NE. of Nejef.

There is a horse-tramway from Kafeh to Nejef. General Description. —Kufeh has a river frontage of 500-600 yds. For details of bridge and river see Boute IV C (i), m. 99 ; it is reported if I406 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS that good cover or support for a bridging-party would be afforded by the two small wooded islands there mentioned. The town has about 600 houses, mostly of stone and mortar; there is one large khan on the 1. bank about 50 yds. above the bridge. The great Kufeh mosque, where 'Ali was murdered, stands about lij m. from the present town on the way to Nejef. The building resembles a fortified enclosure : from the wall surrounding it, which is 30 ft. high, small semicircular bastions (10 ft. in diameter) project at intervals of 50 ft. Inside, the mosque is like a caravanserai, having a courtyard (128 paces long and 104 paces wide) surrounded on three sides by small cubicles. The mosque is adjoined by two other brick enclosures, one of them on the E. side having a wall about 20 ft. high: within it are the tombs of Muslim-bin-Aqll and Hani- hin-Amwah, which are both objects of veneration. There are two or three small khans N. of the mosque. On the SW. side of the town is a ruin-field marking the site of the mediaeval city, and about 2 or 3 m. S. of Kufeh are the ruins of Hirah, a great city of the pre-Moslem period. Supplies and Commerce. —Kufeh is surrounded on all sides by excellent date plantations, and there are gardens on the 1. bank of the channel. Fruit, vegetables, and forage can be had in abundance. It is a general centre for the distribution of goods brought from Basra over a wide tract of country. In 1908 there were about 100 occupied shops, numerous store-houses and places of business. 6 to 12 safmehs of medium size are generally anchored off the town. Inhabitants. —About three-fourths of the population are Shiah Arabs; the remaining quarter are Persians, including a few Per- sianized Baluchis: some inhabitants of Nejef also have houses or offices in the town. Administration and Authorities. —Kufeh is the head-quarters of a Nahiye in the Kaza of Nejef, and is administered by a Mudir. Before the war it was a small military post. History. —The original town of Kufeh was founded as an Arab centre about a. d . 638, after the battle of Qadislyeh ( a. d . 635) had put Irak into the hands of the Mohammedans. 'Ali, the nephew of the Prophet, and the originator of the Shiah sect, was assassinated here in a. d . 661, and the town was subsequently a noted centre of Shiah intrigue against the Ommayad Caliphs, under whom it shared with Basra the title of Traqan, or capital of Irak. Subsequently, however, it declined and disappeared, and the modern town is said to be only about 30 years old. The name is interpreted to mean ' the reed huts'. The style of Arabic writing known as Kufic had its origin here.V ^ : i *%. ' t t lot) ym KUFEH—KUENA 407 KURNA. On the r. bank of the Tigris at its junction with the old channel of the Euphrates.

General Description. —The town stands at the angle formed by the Tigris and the Euphrates, which flow past its E. and S. sides, its main front being on the Tigris. For the details of the rivers at this point, and of the bar in the Shatt el-Arab below the town, see Boute I B. On the N. and W. town and adjoining gardens are surrounded by the remains of mud-wall fortifications said to be very old and now hardly more than mounds. To the N. of the town is the suburb of Nuheirat, stretching about If m. along the r. bank of the Tigris. This is the head-quarters of the Sheikh of Kurna. Kurna has a frontage on the Tigris of about 1,000 yds. There are a few fairly good houses on the front and several more in the town back from the river. Near the centre of the river front is the or late Turkish Oovernment offices. There is a small bazaar in the town, part of which is roughly roofed in. The date-gardens of Kurna and most of the space within the old fortifications are below Tigris flood-level, the water being kept out by artificial banks. There are thick date-groves opposite Kurna on the farther banks of the Tigris and Euphrates. Climate and Hygiene. —The climate is damp, unpleasant, and unhealthy in summer. Malaria is prevalent: mosquitoes and other water-bred insects swarm. In winter the climate is said to be cold and bracing. Supplies and Commerce. —Dates, barley, wheat, and rice are grown. The chief manufacture of the town is that of the ordinary Arab cloaks {'(ib(is) and of light summer cloaks Before the war sheep and cattle from Amara used to be driven in droves through Kurna on the way to Basra. There are numerous buffaloes in the neighbourhood. The inhabitants of Kurna and the district own a large number of maheilehs and cargo hellams, used chiefly for transport between Amara and Basra. There are also in the district some thousands of danajcs and mashhuf (canoes). I I I408 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are town Arabs calling themselves Qurnawi and denying any connexion with the surrounding tribes. They are Shiahs. A number are merchants and shopkeepers, the remainder boatmen, gardeners, and artisans. There are about 30 Persians and a few soi-disant Persians who have taken out certificates of Persian nationality to escape Turkish taxation. Authorities. —Kurna under the Turkish regime was the capital of a Kam in the Baghdad Vilayet. There was a small Turkish garrison and a custom-house. The Government levied a tax on the reed- mats, grass, and reeds exported by river from the Euphrates marshes, and a toll on the cattle and sheep which passed through Kurna on their way from Amara to Basra. The remaining revenue came from a tax on date plantations and arable land. The Arab Sheikh of Kurna, Gabashi, exercises a certain amount of authority in the town, and is also Sheikh of Muzeira'ah on the opposite side of the Tigris and of the Beni Mansur country to the south of the old channel of the Euphrates. (See further Route IV A.) History. —Kurna is said to occupy the site of a more ancient place called Dighah. Tradition places the Garden of Eden here and alleges that a tree exists which was planted by Noah. The position has been of great military importance since, at the end of the Middle Ages, the Tigris changed its course so as to unite with the Euphrates here (instead of near Nasirlyeh). There was a fort at Kurna at the end of the sixteenth century. The present town was founded more than a century ago by the Turks to serve as a d'appui in their wars against Persia. It was occupied by the British in December 1914. KUT EL-AMARA (or simply Kut). On the 1. bank of the Tigris, 204 m. below Baghdad by river and 112 m. by road.

There is a row of fairly well-built houses along the river front, the Turkish barracks being the square building at the west end. In the neigh bourhood of the town on either bank there is a belt of country in which barley and wheat are cultivated. The Turkish boat-bridge before the present war consisted of 36-41 pontoons, the number varying with the rise and fall of the river. There is a quay suitable for river steamers. Supplies and Commerce. —The town before the war was the centre of a considerable grain traffic, corn from the Euphrates country being brought here by way of the Shatt el-Arab for distribution in the Tigris region. The Dd'irat es-Samyeh had large grain-stores here. Supplies from local produce are said to be scarce, but some barley, wheat, oats, maize, and mash are cultivated in the neighbourhood, and there is a considerable export of liquorice. Woollen rugs {Jiaramdt) and coarse carpets {zuU) are manufactured here. The trade is mostly with the Kurdish towns of Jessan and Bedrah, and is not important. There are about 200 shops, 10 khans, and 8 cafes. _ -ri -i* Inhabitants. —A large proportion of the population are Earn Kurds. The rest are Shiah Arabs, except 100 Jews and a few Christians. The surrounding country belongs to the Beni Eabi'ah. The inhabitants of the town for the most part cultivate the soil and breed cattle, or else are dealers in grain or wool, and brokers and shopkeepers. The Kurds are porters and carriers, the Jews goldsmiths, and the Christians liquorice-merchants. Administration and Authorities. —Kut was the head-quarters of a Kaza of the same name in the Baghdad Sanjaq of the of Baghdad. There were a few Turkish police, a harbour-master, and a custom-house. Customs, Tobacco Eegie, and the Public Debt Department are each represented by a Mamur. Before the war the Turks were maintaining here a garrison of some 200 men to keep the Beni Lam in order.

General Description. —Mohammareh lies on the r. bank of the so-called Haffar Channel, the main mouth of the Karun River, which flows into the Shatt el-'Arab about 1 m. below the town. Opposite Mohammareh on the 1. bank of the Haffar Channel lies the small village of Kut esh-Sheikh. The frontage of the town extends along the river, where erosion is prevented by revetments of date-palm wood forming quays and wharves. At its upper end this frontage is enclosed by the date-palms of Nahr Siyab, at its lower end by those of Hisan. These date- groves are only about -4- m. deep. Behind the town stretches an open, treeless desert. Europeans live on the banks of the Haffar Channel above and below the town. For the buildings between the town and the mouth of the Shatt el-'Arab see Rou I A, under m. 48^. Mohammareh is built partly of brick, partly of mud. Somewhat back from the river is the brick bazaar with a domed roof, built by the present Sheikh. On the river in the town are the palace of Haji Rais et-Tujjar, the Persian post office, the Persian telegraph office, the Old Battery, and the building of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Ibis last is at the NE. end of the town. . Farther up-stream is the Persian Resident's house, and, finally, round a bend are the houses of the manager and the assistant manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia. All the buildings outside the town stand among date-palms. The town contains 6 mosques, three public baths, several nativeMOHAMMAREH 411 hostelries {huseiniyehs) and store-houses for merchants' goods (here called Maws). Climate and Hygiene. —Accurate observations ot temperature are not available for any extended period (see vol. i, chap, ii), but the following figures may be taken as approximations. In January, the coldest month, the average maximum temperature at Moham- mareh is 57° F. and the minimum 45° F. The extremes met with during the month are 67° F. and 32° F. Rain falls between November 1 and April 1, and the yearly average at Moham- mareh is about 11 inches. From April to October there is no rain, and hot winds prevail. During July and August, the hottest months, the average maximum temperature at Mohammareh is 103° F. and the average minimum 86° F. with extremes of 110° F. and 84° F. respectively. Other authorities state that the temperature of Mohammareh ranges from 32° F. to 115° F. The usual daily range of temperature in July is from 85° F. to 110° F., and in January from 40° F. to 57° F. It is said that about the middle of May a dry NW. wind generally Wows for some 10 days, followed by a calm of similar duration before the setting in of the or Great North-Wester, which lasts for about 40 days. After the Bdrih come, as a rule, 10 days of light southerly breezes, and there» after hot winds from the NW. and damp winds from SE. till the end of August. The summer heat at Mohammareh, although intense, is dry and not unhealthy. From the middle of October to the end of April the climate may be called pleasant. For the high- and low- water seasons of the Karun see Route II A. The town, despite the great improvement it has undergone, con tinues to be highly insanitary. The only kind of drain is a channel cut down the middle of each street and generally choked up except after rain. In 1913 a consular surgeon was appointed, but the post almost immediately fell vacant and was not filled. In 1914 the plans for a hospital were submitted to Government. A dispensary does good work, but no progress has been made with the proposed hospital. The more common diseases are ailments of the eye, skin, and digestive system, and venereal diseases. Supplies and Commerce. —Large stocks of rice and dates are gene rally available in bazaar. Much barley is produced in the country around, lai-gely for exportation in normal times. The amount of wheat produced varies considerably. The value of wheat exported has varied between £200,000 and 500,000 in recent years. In 1910 the existing flour-mills were not sufficient for the normal requirements of the town. The amount of vegetables varies,412 GAZETTEEK OF TOWNS Onions and beans are among the chief products of the country. Meat is fairly plentiful, sheep being numerous. There is a fair supply of poultry and bullocks. Beef is of inferior quality. Fish is plentiful. Water is plentiful from the river, but water in wells, being brackish, is to be avoided. The water in the Haffar Channel is purer and cooler than that in the Shatt el-'Arab. Water from creeks and irrigation cuts is unwholesome. Water in the Bahman Shir Kiver is reported excellent. A certain amount of lucerne also, after a good harvest, and chopped straw are locally obtainable. Date-trees, some coal and oil, and timber can be obtained from the Ab-i-Dlz. Probably 1,000 camels are procurable after giving notice. Mules are not obtainable. The commerce of Mohammareh has increased in recent years owing partly to the establishment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. in the Karun valley, and partly to the disturbed state of the country between Shiraz and Bushire, which has resulted in a diversion of trade from the Shiraz—Bushire route to the route from Isfahan to Mohammareh via Nazirl (Ahwaz) and the Karun Eiver. The total value of imports in 1913-14 was .£812,000, a quarter of which represents imports of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. The chief articles imported were textile products from Great Britain, and next to these come sugar, wood, chemicals, tea, and miscellaneous manu factured articles. A failure of the local rice-crop resulted in the import of about 45,000 lb. of rice. The principal exports are wheat and barley (in very varying quantities according to the harvest), dates and wool (these commodities are from Arabistan itself), and opium, gum, and tobacco, which are sent down from the interior. The British firms at Mohammareh in 1914 were as follows:— The Imperial Bank of Persia; Messrs.Lynch &amp; Co.; Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co.; Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. On these firms see further under Basra. The Anglo-Persian Oil Co., for whom Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. act as agent. The principal Persian merchant in Mohammareh is Haji Kais et- Tujjar, who is the Wazir of the Sheikh and the agent of the Nazirl Co.'s steamers. This company is owned by Mu'in et-Tujjar, who has a house at Ahwaz-Nazirl. Haji Kais is agent for the Russian Steam Navigation Co., the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Co., the Arabs' Steamers Co., Ltd., and the Persian Gulf Steamship Co. Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. (whose representatives are at present interned) have offices and warehouses here. This German firm (alsoMOHAMMAEEH 413 agents for the Hamburg-Amerika line) had been making strenuous efforts to obtain a footing in the trade of Mohammareh. During 1913 -14 the German steamers, which had imported 34,000 tons of railway material into Basra for the Baghdad Railway, were ready to take grain at specially low freights in order to get a cargo, an opportunity that was taken advantage of by Messrs. Wonckhaus. Inhabitants.—In 1908 most of the inhabitants were Arabs belonging to the various divisions of the Muhaisin tribe. There were also numerous descendants of Bahreinis, Persians, a colony of Sabians, and a few Jews and Oriental Christians. The Bahreinis are mostly small shopkeepers and mechanics ; the Sabians are silversmiths, the Jews deal in Manchester goods, and the Christians are clerks and lightermen. The population has more than doubled within the last eight or nine years. Persian is spoken in the town concurrently with Arabic. Administration and Authorities. —The Sheikh of Mohammareh is His Excellency the Khazal Khan, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E. He is the hereditary Sheikh of the Muhaisin tribe, nominally subject to the Persian Government with the titles of Governor of the Shatt el-'Arab and Karun, Governor of Mohammareh, and Warden of the Marches. He is in practice independent ruler of all Southern Arabistan. His Wazir is Haji Eais et-Tujjar, C.I.E., of an important Persian family. The eldest son of the Sheikh, Khasib Khan, was in 1914 governor of Ahwaz. In addition to being the head of the Muhaisin tribe, the Sheikh also controls the once powerful tribe of Kaab, whose head quarters are at Eellahlyeh. The Sheikh's rule over the tribesmen is extremely stringent but just, and fully in accordance with tribal usage and opinion. Tribal councils of the Muhaisin, consisting of head men, meet at Faillyeh. The Sheikh is the largest landowner in Arabistan. The chief officer of the town of Mohammareh has the title of Naib el-Hukumeh, but all important matters are settled by the Wazir, or, in his absence, by his deputy. While the Sheikh is director-general of the customs the deputy-director is a Belgian.^ The Sheikh has always shown himself friendly to the British Government, from which he has received support and distinc tion. History. —A city under various names existed on or near the site of Mohammareh from the time of Alexander the Great onwards. It has for long been under the rule of the paramount Sheikh of one or other of the neighbouring Arab tribes. In 1841 the Sheikh of Mohammareh recognized the suzerainty of Persia in order to save himself from Turkish rule. In 1857, during the Anglo-Persian414 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS War, a British Expeditionary Force occupied the place after a skirmish. At the conclusion of the war the Sheikh of the Ka'ab, who had till then ruled Mohammareh and S. Arabistan, was deposed by the Persian Government, and replaced by the Sheikh of the smaller tribe of the Muhaisin. Since then, except for a short interval from 1860 to 1862, the paramount Sheikh of the Muhaisin has ruled over the Kaab. In the years preceding the war, the close relations of the present Sheikh with Great Britain had caused both the Persian and Turkish Governments to adopt an unfriendly attitude towards him. The Turkish Government tried to encroach on the Sheikh's territories in the region of Hawlzeh, and the intervention of Great Britain became necessary. The Persian Government refused to confirm the Sheikh's concessions to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; no notice, however, was taken of this refusal. MUSEYIE. On the Euphrates, 8 m. above the bifurcation of the Hindiyeh and Hilla arms at the Hindiyeh Barrage. Pop., permanent, about 3,500 (1908); pilgrims generally about 1,500 .; 1,000 houses. P.O. T.

General Description.—The town lies principally on the 1. bank, and the covered bazaar is in this quarter, but some of the principal buildings, including Government offices and several good khans, are in the smaller quarter on the r. bank, The width of the river at Museyib is from 200-300 yds. : owing to its narrowness, its high banks, and the neighbourhood of the bar rage the river is exceptionally deep, and is said to vary from 12 ft. i ^(h'W*)' The bottom is of firm earth, and the banks 15 ft. high and fairly steep: the current runs at 2-|-3 m. p. h. There is a very dangerous curve in the river here, which needs heavy protective work: if the Euphrates were to burst its banks heie, serious inundations would ensue. On the 1. bank, imme diately above the town, a strong embankment, carefully revetted,MOHAMMAEEH—MUSEYIB —N ASIEIYEH 416 extends for about 600 yds., and along the top of it runs the Baghdad Museyib is surrounded by palm-groves, and has the aspect of a pleasant country town. Supplies and Commerce. —Museyib stands amid extensive date plantations: it is estimated that there are 40,000 palms in the neighbourhood. It is also the centre of a good agricultural district, and supplies of barley and other grain may be had : there are 25 grain stores. It was estimated (1903) that a month's supplies for an infantry brigade and its transport could be obtained from Mu seyib and its neighbourhood. There are 12 khans and 100 shops. There are no local manufactures, and trade is inconsiderable, centring mostly around travellers from Baghdad to Kerbela. In the busy season 12 sofmehs are retained to bring up rice from the barrage and to take down Baghdad merchandise to boats waiting below the barrage. In the off-season 7 of these are released for up-stream traffic. There are 20 sujehs (small boats). Inhabitants. —The great majority of the people are Shiah Arabs, but there are small Jewish, Persian, Turkish, and British-Indian communities: there are no resident Christians. There is a floating population of pilgrims on their way to Kerbela. Administration and Authorities. —Museyib is the head-quarters of a Nahiye in the Kaza of Kerbela. The Da'irat has many estates in the neighbourhood, and has planted a number of masonry enclosures : these are used as store-houses, but resemble military forts. NASIBIYEH.

General Description. —Nasirlyeh stands among date-groves on the 1. bank of the Euphrates about 5 m. above the mouth of the Sadanawlyeh Canal leading to the Shatt el-Hai. The Turkish boat-bridge (25 pontoons) was about 1-| m. above the town, opposite416 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS a suburb of mud huts and date plantations on the r. bank. The date-groves on the I. bank were reported in 1908 to end at the boat-bridge. Nasirlyeh has a river-frontage of about m. It is unwalled. The town contains about 600 good masonry houses in broad, well-aligned streets, with numerous mud huts on the outskirts. There are large blocks of Turkish Government buildings which com prise civil offices, military barracks, an artillery-park, a hospital, and stores. There are 3 khans in the town. Supplies and Commerce. —The surrounding country produces a considerable quantity of wheat, barley, rice, and maize, of which there is usually a surplus for export. It was reported in 1915 that 'large numbers of live stock and great quantities of vegetables and fruit can be obtained here, of which latter a considerable amount comes from Samaweh'. Boats are built here by the Sabians. A class of cavgo-bellam, of about 10 tons, called the Euphrates hellam, is to be found at Nasirlyeh. A few larger craft (apparently maheilehs) were generally lying here in normal times. Land transport (pack animals) can be obtained from neighbouring Arab tribes ; there is no evidence as to the amount available. Besides cereals, skins, hides, and ghi are exported. The principal imports before the war were Manchester piece-goods, groceries, spices, and drugs. There are about 350 shops in the town. The place was a market for neighbouring Arabs (Muntefiq and Dhaflr). Inhabitants. Most of the inhabitants are Shiah Arabs, but there were in 1908 over 1,000 Sunnis, as well as about 300 Sabians, 300 Peisians, 150 Jews, and a few Turks, Kurds, and Oriental Christians. The Sabians are goldsmiths, carpenters, and boat-builders. Administration and Authorities. —Nasirlyeh was the head-quarters of the Turkish Sunja (j of Muntefiq in the of Basra. Before the war the officer commanding the garrison discharged also the civil functions of Governor of the as the place was an outpost of Turkish authority in an unsettled country (especially in the years immediately preceding the war, Sa'adun Pasha, the para mount chief of the Muntefiq, had been giving trouble).

Horse-tramway. General Description. —Nejef stands in the desert on a ridge of reddish sandstone gravel, and overlooks from the NE. the Bahr-i-Nejef, to which the ridge falls away to the hahr in cliffs about 40 ft. high. The hahris now quite dry near the town and contains several date plantations. On the plateau surrounding the town on every side except to the SW., irregular earthen mounds rise in different directions: some of those to N. and E. are 30 ft. high with narrow summits. A mound of rubbish, also narrow topped, but commanding the town, is situated on the SW. side between the town and the bahr. On the S. is open ground, where the Turkish Nejd Expeditionary Force was encamped (1904, 1905). The Hamldiyeh (or Bakrlyeh) Canal from the Hindiyeh runs in the bed of the iahr, skirting the foot of the cliffs. Opposite the town its bed is 12 ft. wide and 12 ft. deep, but at l.w. it shrinks to about 6 ft. wide and 6 in, deep, and is liable to be filled with drifting sand. The cemeteries adjoin the N, and E, sides of the town : the environs generally contain market-gardens and recent plantations of date-palms. The town itself, which is roughly quadrangular, is surrounded by a wall about a century old, built to defend it against the Sunni Wahhabls : it is about 30 ft, high with circular bastions, about 50 in number, each 50 ft, in diameter, at intervals of 100 yds.: this work is now in a state of decay. There are two main gateways, one 12 ft., the other 9 ft. wide, on the E. face of the town: on the SW. side, towards the Jxihr, is a third gate. In the W. wall is an aperture, known as Thilmeh, a passage large enough to permit field-artillery to pass. At the NE. corner, near the military barracks, is a fourth gate. The shrine which contains the tomb of Ali rises in the centre of the town, and is the richest and most splendid of all Shiah holy places. The sanctuary lies in the middle of an enclosed court: it is double-storied, and the gold plating of the minarets reaches almost to the ground. Christians are not admitted to the shrine. The main bazaar runs from the shrine to the larger E. gate, and in it are situated the Turkish Government buildings The municipal buildings are over the larger gate on the E. side. There mes. ii. d d418 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS is a dilapidated Turkish barrack in the NE. quarter, and about 20 caravanserais, including 5 or 6 well-built brick khans, outside the town on NE. about 25 yds. from the wall. The space within the walls is completely filled with buildings, which are mostly of brick and mortar, largely modern. The importance of Nejef lies in its containing the reputed tomb of 'Ali, who, it is believed, was buried here after his murder at Kufeh in a . r». 661. For this reason it is a holy place and a centre of pilgrimage for the Shiahs of all Moslem countries. From Nejef a pilgrim route is continued through the Nejd to Mecca, and the town has been used by the Turks in recent years as a base for military operations in N. Arabia. Supplies and Commerce. —Nejef is built round a pilgrim centre on the edge of the desert. The town is thus dependent for receiving its supplies and for transport on the neighbouring Bedouin : in ordinary times two-thirds of the imports are said to be consumed by the pilgrims, and it is alleged that the place could be starved in a week. The principal exports are lambskins, sheepskins, and wool, brought in from the adjacent country. The chief imports are Manchester piece-goods, sugar, spices, tea, hardware, and timber. 'Ahas are made here of particularly beautiful design. There is a considerable trade with Jebel Shammar, which is carried on by hadrahs or commercial missions, sometimes officially dispatched by the Emir of Jebel Shammar. Even when there is water in the Bahr-i-Nejef, it is not drunk except by animals, but serves for washing and other domestic purposes. A better water-supply is now furnished by the Hamldiyeh, an open water-canal, the property of the Ba'i which brings the water of the Hindiyeh to the town. When the Hamldiyeh Canal fails in the low-water season, drinking-water is brought from the Hindiyeh in skins. The water of the local wells is brackish. Inhabitants. —More than one-third of the population are Persians: the rest are nearly all Arabs, with a few negroes, Indians, Barbaris of Afghan origin, and Turks. No Jews or Christians are found here. Except Grovernment employees the entire population is Shiah. It is inclined to be fanatical. The town is divided between two turbulent factions, the Shumurd and Zugurd, of which the origin has not been explained. Serious street-fighting sometimes takes place. Most of the permanent residents depend for their livelihood on functions connected with the shrine. There is a large floating population of Shiah pilgrims who come chiefly from Persia and India in the cold weather, with the object of visiting the shrine of the martyr Ali, and ending their days or buryingNEJEF—RUMEITHEH—SAMAWEH 419 their relations in the holy place. The result is that the town is H much overcrowded, and ' people are here heaped on top of one another'. See further on Shiah pilgrimages, vol. i, p. 83. Administration and Authorities. —Nejef is the head-quarters of a of the same name in the Kerbela of the of Baghdad. Before the war Turkish administration was maintained at the lowest strength compatible with effective control: the garrison consisted of one company of infantry with a small force of mounted police. The Shiah Mujtahkls (see vol. i, p. 86) are numerous, and the influence of some of them extends throughout the Shiah world. RUMEITHEH, on the Hilla Branch of the Euphrates, 28^ m. above Samaweh. Pop. (1908) 2,500, River Route. —See Euphrates, Itoute IV C, ii (Hilla Branch), m. 27. General Description. —The town is situated on both banks of the river, and its houses are scattered among gardens and date-groves. For some years previous to the completion of the new Hindiyeh Barrage (1914) the productivity of the soil was seriously affected, and the population diminished owing to the drying up of the Hilla Branch. In 1908 the number of houses was estimated at 600, mostly low mud huts, but a large proportion of them were deserted. There is an old stone fort on 1. bank of river near lower end of the town. Supplies and Commerce. —In 1908 there were 180 shops, of which 40 were then unoccupied. Animals for food and transport are kept in the neighbourhood, except camels. At that date barley, idhrah, wool, and hides were still being exported, and in the autumn a good deal of business was transacted with the Arabs in the neigh bourhood, for whom Manchester piece-goods, drugs, and groceries were imported. Inhabitants. —The population is wholly Shiah and, with the excep tion of about 70 Persians, Arab. Administration. —Rumeitheh is in the of Abu Qawarlr in the Kaza of Samaweh. SAMAWEH. On the Euphrates, 71 m. by river above Nasirlyeh, near the point where the Hindiyeh and Hilla branches reunite. Pop. 10,000 (?) P.O. T. (the line Basra—Baghdad via the Euphrates valley passed through Samaweh before the present war). Bridge of boats. d d 2 ^ -I ' Vi J \ ! i i420 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS River Routes. —For communications by the Euphrates, see Routes IV B, C. Land Routes.— (i) To Basra. (See Route 12.) (ii) To Hilla.

(See Rou 12.) General Description. —The river divides the town into two parts, of which that on the r. bank is the larger and better and contains the Government offices, but there are brick houses in both quarters, and the military barracks (in 1908 described as ruinous but occupied) for 1 battalion are on the 1. bank. There are 6 khans and 8 mosques. The town is surrounded by an old mud wall. Supplies and Commerce. —The neighbourhood of Samavveh pro duces enough wheat, barley, rice, and vegetables to enable the town to export a considerable surplus. Samaweh is a centre for the corn- trade of the neighbouring districts. The date-palms do not suffice for local consumption. Wool and lambskins are exported. All kinds of transport animals, except camels, are owned by the surrounding tribes, but the number that might be procured cannot be calculated. In 1908 the supply of boats did not suffice for the river-traffic to and from the town. The only local manufacture is a kind of woollen carpet. The imports are Manchester piece-goods, coffee, sugar, and indigo. Most of the trade before the war used to be with Basra, but some goods were imported from Baghdad, and the tribes of the neighbouring desert and of the Nejd made purchases here. There are about 250 shops. Inhabitants. —The inhabitants are almost entirely Shiah Arabs, but there are Persian and Jewish communities, a few Turks, and some Abyssinian slaves. Samaweh is much frequented by the local tribes, especially the Muntefiq. Administration and Authorities. —Samaweh is the head-quarters of a Kasa, with the ordinary officials. In peace-time the Turks main tained a small garrison here, which was usually absent collecting the revenue from the neighbouring tribes. There was a small police force. Politically Samaweh has been of importance as one of the chief points of contact between the Turkish authorities and the tribes of the Nejd. SHUSHTAR. The capital of N. Arabistan, situated on an islandSAMAWEH—SHUSHTAR—SUQ E8H-SHUYUKH 421 at the point where the Karun divides into two branches, the Ab-i- Shatait and Ab-i-Gargar. Pop. about 10,000 (so latest reports ; but estimates vary greatly). P.O. (Persian). T. (connexion with Dizful, with Ahwaz and Moham- mareh, and through Ahwaz with Indo-European line Bushire— Teheran). River Route. —The upper limit of steamer-navigation on the Karun is at Shaleili on the Ab-i-Gargar, about 7 m. below Shushtar. Land Routes.— (i) To Dizful. (See Boute 6 c.) (ii) To Isfahan via the Lynch Koad. (See • iii. 71.) (iii) To Ramuz. (See Routes in iii. 72.) (iv) To Mamatain. (See Boutes iii. 77.) (v) To Qalah Bazuft. (See Bout iii. 184.) (vi) To Deh Luran. (See Routes iii. 101.) The citadel, on a bluff overlooking the Ab-i-Shatait, used to be very strong, but is now commanded from part of the town and from the hills W. of the Ab-i-Shatait. Bridges (i) to Miyanab Island S. of the town (Pul-i-Lashkar) and (ii) over the dam to Bulaiti suburb to E. (Pul-i-Bulaiti). The Pul-i-Dizful over the Ab-i-Shatait is broken down. Supplies and forage (mostly from Miyanab I.) fair. Water-supply good and abundant. Limited mule transport. Cloth- manufactures. Seat of the Persian Governor of N. Arabistan. Two powerful groups of Mujtahids reside here. There are four quarters of the town, each under a Bais : these are constantly fighting with each other. SUQ ESH-SHUYtJKH. On the lower Euphrates at the western end of the marsh and lake country formed by the ' new channel about 63 m. by water above Kurna and 27 m. below Nasirlyeh. Pop. 12,000(?). P.O. T. (before the war connected by a branch with the main line from Basra to Baghdad Euphrates Valley). Bridge of boats. River Routes. —For communications by the Euphrates see IV A, B. Land Routes.— (i) To Basra via KhamlsTyeh. (See 13.) (ii) To Ha'il. (See under Boute 24 a.) General Description.-—The town, which is at the upper end of the Mezlaq Channel, and about 2 m. below^the upper end of the Haqiqeh422 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Channel, stands among numerous fruit gardens and date plantations, and lies mainly on the r. bank of the river. There is a quarter on the 1. bank, connected with the main town by the bridge of boats. This bridge consisted, before the present war, of about 12 pontoons, increased to 15 or 16 when the river rose. The climate is reported to be unhealthy owing to the neighbouring marshes. Supplies and Commerce. —Large supplies of fruit and live stock are said to be available here. There are about 200 shops, and trade is carried on with the neighbouring Arabs (hence the name of the town, ' Sheikhs' market'). 'Abas are manufactured here, and the Sabians who live in the l.-bank quarter are boat-builders, blacksmiths, and goldsmiths. Inhabitants. —Three-fourths of the population are Shiah Arabs. The Sabians number about 700: the religious head of their com munity lives here. There are also about 300 Jews engaged in petty trade and money-lending. Administration and Authorities. —Suq esh-Shuyukh, under the Turkish regime, was the head-quarters of a Kaza in the Nasirlyeh Sanjagi of the Vilayet of Basra. There was no garrison maintained here; but detachments of the garrison of Nasirlyeh were quartered at various posts in the neighbourhood (e. g. at Khamislyeh). TAWARIJ (Hindiyeh). On the Hindiyeh branch of the Euphrates, 12 m. below its head. Pop. about 4,000 (1908). P.O. T. (single lines to Hilla and to Kerbela). Boat-bridge (21 pontoons). River Routes. — For communications by the Euphrates see Boute IV C. Land Routes.— (i) To Kerbela. (See Boute 15.) (ii) To Hilla. (See JRoute 15.) (iii) To Nejef. (See Boute 16.) General Description. —Most of the town is on the r. bank of the Hindiyeh, and, the surrounding country being low, it is protected on the three landward sides by an embankment, which encircles it at a radius of a few minutes' walk. On this side of the river are numerous masonry buildings and all the public offices. The quarter on the 1. bank, consisting of some mud houses, a few shops, and a good khan (owned by a Baghdadi Jew), is connected by the boat- bridge with the main town. There are three other khans and mosques. Supplies and Commerce. —Tawarlj was in 1908 still a large entrepotStJQ ESH-SHUYUKH—TAWAElJ—ZOBEIE 423 for rice brought from other districts, although in the immediate vicinity half the area formerly under rice had been thrown out ot cultivation owing to the drying up of the country: the produce-tax payable on rice had fallen to about one-third of its former amount. Besides rice, Tawarlj exports barley, wheat, dates, and wool. Euttalo, cattle sheep, and goats are numerous in the neighbourhood, bhops number about 150. The Anazeh tribesmen visit the place m large numbers to make their annual purchases of food and clothing: the only considerable import is that of Manchester piece-goods from Baghdad ; there is a little trade with Basra. Camels can be had only when the Anazeh are in the neighbourhood, but a considerable number of horses and donkeys are procurable in the district. About 20 boats of the size ordinarily in use on the Hindiyeh arm are as a rule obtainable here. , , . i Inhabitants. —Nearly all are Shiah Arabs, but there are also a tew Persians, Jews, and Turks, a very few Punjabis and Afghans, and half a dozen Oriental Christians. , . Administration and Authorities. —Tawarij is the head-quarters ot a Kaza with the usual officials. ZOBEIR. In the desert, about 11m. SW. of Basra. Pop. 6,000 (1908). Routes.— (i) To Umm Qasr. (See Routes 23 a, 23 b.) (ii) To Koweit via the Mutla'ah Pass. (See 23 c.) (iii) To Ha'il. (See under Route 24 a.) General Description, —The town, which is walled, stands on a slight eminence. The ground near the town is barren on all sides except to the SE., where are the lucerne fields and melon patches of Dirhamlyeh. On the NAV.. along the first 3 m. of the Basra roa d, are the ruins of Old Basra, consisting of mounds of earth interspersed with fragments of yellow brick. Within the walls the dwelling- houses are built of brick (sun-dried or burnt). There is a large covered bazaar, mostly of masonry. The tomb of Zobeir (see p. ■'--i) is distinguished by a blue tile-work minaret about 40 ft. high, with a dangerous inclination towards the north. Climate and Hygiene, —The climate is drier than that of Basra, and for this reason many notables and landowners of the Basra neighbourhood have houses at Zobeir to which they retire in the hot weather. The better houses in the town are fitted with hudgi rs or wind-catchers and serdubs, or underground rooms, ventilated by hadglrs.424 GAZETTEER OF TOWNS Supplies and Commerce. —In normal times all necessary supplies tor caravans could be purchased at Zobeir; these, except a certain quantity of melons and lucerne, apparently came from Basra or the neighbouring villages. The supply of drinking-water seems to have come from the wells SE. of the town in the Dii-hamlyeh tract. Camels and donkeys could be collected at Zobeir from the desert Arabs : no details are available as to the numbers. Zobeir is a market for the neighbouring Bedouin, and a centre of the carrying trade of NE. Arabia. Juss is exported from Zobeir. Sandals and rude saddles are manufactured. Inhabitants. The population consists almost wholly of Sunnis (see below under History). The carrying trade probably supports a larger number of the population than any other industry. Wealthy inhabitants of Basra neighbourhood reside here in the summer (see ab , 0 J e ) and some important families of central Arabian origin are settled here. The people of Zobeir were legally exempt from militarv service in the Turkish Army. Ad ™ in '' ! f tration a ' d Authorities. —Zobeir was administered under the iurkish regime by a Mudir. Small detachments of police and so diers were maintained here. There is a hereditary Sheikh of owns a P ro P ert y and fortified dwelling-house a few miles JN W. of the town. History. Zobeir was apparently a suburb of Old Basra. Here, accoiding to tradition, was buried Zobeir, the Companion of the prophet, who was killed under the walls of Basra in battle against All, the originator of the Shiah sect. Zobeir's tomb naturally became a o y place to the Sunnis, and a Sunni settlement grew up around it.bibliographical note and list of maps The following are among the books and maps which have been most frequently consulted in preparing this volume :— (A) Official books.

The aim has been to assist the reader in their correct pronunciation, without overburdening the text with a large number of dia critical marks. It will be noted that a long accent is used to mark the length of a vowel above which it is placed (a, I, o, Q) ; the only other symbols employed are ' for the consonant Ain, and ' for the Hamzah, or cutting off of the breath which can precede or follow a vowel. Conventional spellings have been retained when sanctioned by general usage; a list of examples, with their correct equivalents, is given on p. 433.TRANSLITERATION OF ARABIC NAMES 429 V. Compound 14. The two components in a compound name (in the absence of the izafat or J1 between them) are written with a capital and without a hyphen connecting them, e.g. Da'ud. 15. When, however, the second member of the compound is a verbal root or is inseparably connected with the first, the whole has been treated as one word whether written in vernacular as one word or two, e. g. Imammdeh, Sdbzd 16. Words which have become Europeanized are left in that form, e.g. Mecca (for MaJikdh), Basra (for Medina (for al-Medmah). 17. The Arabic article J1 prefixed to names has been omitted in English, except in cases where its retention is authorized by general usage. S, .. 18. The word ibn occurring in the name of a person is written without a hyphen before or after it, e. g. II PERSIAN J. Conson 19. The same as for Arabic, plus : v = p i = z (&gt; = z j = v or w = &amp; j=zh £= ch II. 20. The same as for Arabic.430 TRANSLITERATION OF PERSIAN NAMES III. Dip 21. The same as for Arabic. IV. B 22. ' Izafat' is transliterated by i with a' hyphen before and after, e .g. Koh-i-Siydh. 23. Final he (s) is transliterated only when pronounced, e. g. shah,deh. Ill TURKISH 24. The same as for Arabic, plus: Modified vowels 6, u. 25. A few Turkish words where two vowels come together, as in Bair, are written with a Hamza, e. g. Ba'ir. 26. In Turkish a half audible sound is introduced between It and following vowel.

April May June July August September October November December444 \ APPENDIX A Note on the Summer S The main period of the summer is about 20-30 days in length, but it is usually interrupted by a few short breaks. This main period begins as a rule in the first half or middle of June, and is followed by a few short periods in July and August. In 1916 the main period began extraordinarily late (July 21st: see Notes on Weather, above). The Shamal in some degree mitigates the great summer heat, and contributes to the decrease of the floods.(%U APPENDIX B THE CONTROL OF THE TIGRIS WATER M ain C auses op P resent C onditions The main causes of the present condition of the lower Tigris may be summarized as follows :— (i) The bed of the Tigris between Samarra and Kurna is incapable of carrying the whole, or anything like the whole, of the spring flood (March, April, May). Heavy rain may in some years cause the river to touch overflow level for short periods in January or February, or even (exceptionally) in December. _ . 1 (ii) The river is subject to very sudden and violent rises in March and April, when its discharge per second at Baghdad may for short periods be 18-20 times the normal discharge per second in the months of low supply, and more than twice the average discharge per second in the high flood month of April. Sharp but less serious rises may occur irregularly in December, January, and February as the result of heavy rain over a wide area. (Local rain alone is said to have no appreciable effect.) The velocity of the river in flood is about 4 m.p.h. on an average, but may be considerably more (certainly 6 m.p.h. at Baghdad) in a high rise. . (iii) The Tigris carries a great amount of sediment, and is especially turbid in its high rises. (iv) The soil of the Tigris 'delta', which begins in the neighbour hood of Beled, some 12 m. below Samarra, is a soft alluvium. (v) From the neighbourhood of Mansuriyeh, about 40 m. by river above Baghdad, the country on either side of the river is generally below high flood level, and the transverse slope away from the liver is comparatively steep. (vi) While the ancient irrigation system of the Tigris has fallen into utter ruin, no adequate works for the improvement of naviga tion, for irrigation, or for protection against excessive floods have been constructed by the Turkish Government, and, on the other hand, the local damming and cutting, carried on sporadically by the Arabs, has not been controlled.446 APPENDIX B Thus, (a) the river has not been properly trained, so that it covers in low supply a width of bed which its water cannot scour out, and in which much silt is deposited: hence the shifting sand banks, which are especially numerous between Baghdad and Kut. (&amp;) The existing bunds are generally neither strong enough nor extensive enough to give the needed protection against flood, nor have they been kept in regular repair. (c) The existing canals, unscientifically devised^ lacking barrages and regulators to control the diversion of the water, and inadequately maintained, are often the means of drowning the areas which they were meant to benefit. C onditions from S amarba to K ut Introductory The conditions from Samarra to Diyaleh and those from Diyaleh to Kut will be dealt with separately. In each case some account will be given of the general character of the river, of the lie of the land on either side of the river, of the extent to which the land is flooded under normal conditions, and of the possibilities of causing floods by breaching or damming. It must be premised, first, with regard to 'normal' flooding, that the way in which the Tigris spills its surplus water, and the extent, depth, &amp;c., of the inundations, vary more or less from year to year, and that exact details with regard to former inundations are wanting. The information therefore on ' normal' flooding will be only very general. Secondly, there are a very great number of places on either bank of the river where inundations could be caused in flood-time by breaching the banks. In fact, it may be said that when the river is in high flood this could be done with more or less effect almost anywhere from Mansuriyeh to Kut, and, further, Euphrates water could be used for flooding the country on the right bank of the Tigris (see Appendix C). On this point, therefore, only general indications will be given. Information as to details is very in complete and might easily be misleading. A full report on the possibilities of flooding could be based only on exhaustive surveys and personal examination of the ground by a hydraulic engineer. Thirdly, while mere ftMw^-cutting could cause an effective inunda tion only if carried out during short periods when the river is in high flood, a dam even in the low-water season would cause far greater inundations than would result from a simple breaching of the banks in flood -time.CONTROL OF TIGRIS WATER 447 Fourthly, if the floods were caused merely by the destruction of banks and breaching of hunds, they could not be detrimental to the navigation of the river down-stream: they would only be obstacles to movement by land. Such floods would make no difference to the navigation of the Tigris in low supply, and would make navigation in flood-time somewhat easier. In order to prevent navigation down-stream of the diversion it would be necessary to dam the river. Fifthly, no preventive measures against a flooding of the country by an enemy could be taken by a force on the Tigris down-stream of the enemy position, and not within striking distance of the point where they chose to divert the water. All that could be done would be to pro tect limited areas by means of hunds, and under certain circumstances to provide escapes for at least part of the water into areas where it would cause less inconvenience. The only way to make sure against such flooding would be to hold the head of the Tigris delta, and also to hold the Euphrates up to Hit. Sixthly, with regard to damming the river: (1) it would not be impossible, but under the present war conditions would be exceed ingly difficult. It would need much preparation and labour. The news that it was being attempted would spread like wildfire among the natives, for the down-stream Arabs would be ruined by such a work. Early intelligence of it would, therefore, almost certainly be received. It would probably be difficult to get Arab labour for the purpose. (2) The most favourable time for the building of a dam on one of the Mesopotamian rivers would be in the months when the water is falling. The reason, of course, is that as the dam progresses and the channel available for the water decreases, it is of great advantage that the quantity of water in the channel should also decrease. (This holds good both for a stone dam and for one of earth and brushwood.) (3) No hard material (stone) is readily available below Baghdad, and the method of construction would probably be the one usually adopted in Mesopotamia, namely, with earth and brushwood ; a method well known to the Arabs. A dam of this kind is carried out from one or both banks, and its crest must be continually kept above water level. (4) It would probably be best to begin such a dam at the time when the river is beginning to subside (say, early June). Provided that sufficient preparations had been made in the previous months, a dam then begun could be closed in low-water season (say, October). (5) The difficulty of damming would, in the present circumstances, be great even in the favourable season, June-October. The difficulty448 APPENDIX B would increase if, and in proportion as, the volume of the river increased in the time just before the dam was completed. It may, therefore, be said that any damming operation would probably be successful, if at all, only on condition of falling approximately in the period June-October. From Samarra to Diyaleh For the first 12-15 m. below Samarra the Tigris flows over a bed of shingle, sand, and clay, with occasional outcrops of conglomerate forming small rapids. In the neighbourhood of Beled it breaks into two or three channels past a group of islands, and thenceforward its bed is of alluvium. Near the islands its current is very rapid in flood. At Mansuriyeh it carries in very high floods a discharge ' out of all proportion' to what can be discharged by the river-bed at Baghdad. Down-stream navigation by helelts (rafts) is easy, though sometimes^ very slow owing to contrary winds. Safinehs (large native sailing-boats) of 8 tons burden can ascend to Samarra except in high flood : in low water they might have to be got over shallow places above Kazimain by unloading their cargoes. Steamers of 4 ft. draught can apparently ascend to Samarra during the flood season, though they would not be able to make head against a very violent rise. The Country on the Right [West] Barik.—Dovm to the head of the Dujeil Canal, 9 or 10 m. below Samarra, the country on the right bank is fairly high-lying, and is above high flood level, except at a depression running away from the river at Istablat. Between the head of the Dujeil and the Nahr Tarmlyeh (opposite Mansuriyeh), there is a belt of more or less high ground, but to the south of this belt the country is below high flood level, and a certain amount of water finds its way in spring along the Dujeil and its branches. From the Nahr Tarmlyeh down to the country opposite Diyaleh, the land lying westward from the river (as far as the desert plateau north of Lake 'Aqarquf, and, farther south, to within a few miles of the Euphrates) is all below the high flood level of the Tigris with the exception of a few isolated patches, tels, embankments, &amp;c. The Euphrates, W. of Baghdad, is some 16-20 ft. higher than the Tigris, so that its flood levels here command practically all the country between the rivers south of the main desert plateau that ends north of Lake Aqarqtif. The chief exceptions are the island of high-lying desert E. of Fellujeh, and a similar patch of desert between the Latlfiyeh and Iskanderiyeh canals. A depression between the two rivers runs in a SSE. direction from the southern end of e Aqarquf. The line of its lowest levels is roughly parallel to the general courseCONTEOL OF TIGEIS WATER 449 of the Tigris, the distances between them varying here from 4 to 8 m. The r. bank of the Tigris below the Nahr Tarmlyeh is fairly well provided with bunds, and there are a number of embankments pro tecting Baghdad West (i.e. the part on the r. bank of the Tigris) on its landward side. If the Tigris bu and the dams or regulators on the heads of the Euphrates canals are kept intact the country round Baghdad is dry: if the bunds, &amp;c., break, the country will be flooded to an extent varying with the size and position of the breaches. Under normal conditions the country between Baghdad West and Lake 'Aqarquf may be flooded in spring, when access by land to Baghdad may be possible only along embankments. (On one of these embankments runs the Baghdad—Samarra railway.) To north ward this inundation may stretch many miles, southwards it usually does not go much beyond the iron bridge over the Kharr Canal. It is fed by overflows from the r. bank of the Tigris and occasionally from the Saqlawiyeh Canal from the Euphrates (see Appendix C). South of the Kharr bridge, along the Baghdad—Museyib road, there is a belt of country which is usually dry in flood-time. South of this again, at about 10 m. from Baghdad, Eoute Eeports of 1903 and 1905 mention a swampy area, under water in spring and extending for some 5 m., after which higher and drier ground is again reached. This area is marked as liable to flood on Indian Degree Map, sheet 2 C: but later information makes it doubtful whether it has ever been flooded since 1910. It must be remembered, however, that so far as the neighbourhood of Baghdad West and that quarter of the city itself have been free from flood this has been due to the maintenance of the bunds, &amp;c., by the authorities. In an abnormal flood, or if proper precautions have not been taken, the whole country and most of Baghdad West itself may be flooded (as in November-December, 1914). It follows from what has been said above that by breaching the Tigris banks and 'bunds, and also by diverting water from the Euphrates, the whole of this country lying S. of Beled between the Tigris and the desert plateau, and farther S. again between the Tigris and the Euphrates, could be so inundated in flood-time as to leave only scattered islands of dry ground. A dam or dams in this part of the Tigris might cause an inundation stretching down to the Hai. The Country on the Left [East) B —From Samarra to Sindiyeh the country on the 1. bank is on the whole beyond the reach of the Tigris floods. The swamp behind the old Qaim Canal seems to be fed by water from the hills. Between Sa'diyeh (4 m. below Sindiyeh) and Mansuriyeh the land near the Tigris sinks to below the flood mes. ii „ f450 APPENDIX B level of that river, and southwards from Mansuriyeh past Baghdad to the Diyaleh junction there runs a depression which can be flooded from the Tigris. Down to a point perhaps some 8 or 9 m. NE. of Baghdad, this depression is bounded on the E. by higher ground which is not liable to flood from the Tigris. But the whole country S. of Sindiyeh between the Tigris and the Diyaleh is commanded by the Diyaleh's flood levels, and is irrigated chiefly by a net-work of canals from that river. The angle between the last reaches of the Diyaleh and the Tigris S. of Mo'adhdham is low ground commanded by both rivers. The Tigris from Mansuriyeh downwards is fairly well bunded on its 1. bank, though spills occur at certain points, e. g. at Yehudiyeh. Baghdad, with the riverside land to N. and S. of it from Mo'adhdham down to Qarareh, is now protected by a long earth embankment, within which are smaller bunds. The protective works on the Diyaleh are much less considerable. In normal years the low-lying ground NE., E., and SE. of Baghdad is inundated chiefly from the Diyaleh, owing to the greater care bestowed on the Tigris The Diyaleh in flood-time carries a very considerable volume of water down to the Tigris, though nearly all its supply is taken for irriga tion above Baqubeh. (In order to divert the Diyaleh water into the Khalis Canal for purposes of irrigation, a dam is made every year across the Diyaleh near the head of the Khalis.) If the protecting Baghdad East are broken, as well as those on the Tigris and the Diyaleh, the greater part of the city E. of the river might be flooded, only a narrow strip along the bank being left dry. This, however, would be abnormal (it happened in November-December, 1914). If the city is flooded the water would come from the land ward side, the river-fronts in Baghdad itself being too high and solid to allow of a spill through them. It is clear that in flood-time practically all the country E. of the Tigris from Sindiyeh down to the Diyaleh junction could be inun dated from the Diyaleh, or from the Tigris, or from both rivers, if their banks and bunds were broken. From Diyaleh On this section of its course the river is very winding, so that while the distance by road from Diyaleh to Kut is 103 m., the distance by river is about 184 m. The width of the stream is about 400 yds. on an average. The velocity of the current is generally 3-|-4i| m.p.h, in flood, and about 1-1^ m.p.h. in low water. The depth is about 26 ft. in flood, but in low supply there are someCONTEOL OF TIGEIS WATEE 451 reaches where only 3 ft. of water is to be found, and navigation is much impeded by shifting sand-banks. At one of the worst reaches, in the loop S. of Ctesiphon, the Turks have made a new cut. Dredging is useless in this part of the river, as the silt banks up again immediately. The river needs training, but this, to be really effective, would require works on a very considerable scale. The banks are fairly high, being about 20-16 ft. above low-water level. The Country on the Bight BanTt. —The land on the r. bank slopes away to the depression mentioned above as running between the Tigris and the Euphrates from Lake 'Aqarquf. This depression here runs about SE. (the lowest levels being apparently found at distances of 4-18 m. from the Tigris) as far as a point about W. of Bogheileh. Thence its course seems to bear more to the S., to join the shallow valley which runs southwards from the r. bank of the Tigris immediately below Bogheileh. This valley keeps W. of the Shatt el-Hai, leading towards the Euphrates. It is to be observed that the Euphrates at Hilla is still higher than the Tigris at 'Azlziyeh or Bogheileh : but the Tigris from Bogheileh to Kut is considerably higher than the Euphrates from Samaweh to Nasiriyeh. The Hai Oanal used to carry water in the flood season from Kut to Nasiriyeh, but very little of its flood supply now reaches the Euphrates near the latter place: its main southern outlets seem to be the Nahr Beidha and the Nahr Hamzeh, which run into the Hammar Lake. The dyking on the r. bank of the Tigris in this section is insig nificant. Under normal conditions the river in the flood season forms a number of inundations as far as the depression between it and the Euphrates, and in the valley S. of Bogheileh. In high floods, for instance, a considerable spill might take place at the southern end of the loop below Ctesiphon. But most of the marshes between the rivers seem to be fed by Euphrates water coming from the higher levels above Diwaniyeh; and this water might even reach the neighbourhood of the Tigris, The marshes, if not renewed from the rivers, gradually turn salt and evaporate, having no adequate outlets. Down to Bogheileh, practically the whole country from the Tigris to the farther slope of the depression between the rivers could be flooded by a breaching of the Tigris banks. The most favourable points for breaching would usually be on the outer side of southerly bends. At one or other of these bends a dam or dams might be so placed as to turn the river water into the depression between Tigris and Euphrates. The water would force its way down this depres sion into the shallow valley S. of Bogheileh and so to the Euphrates, p f 2 fl452 APPENDIX B and would also probably flood most of the country between the rivers. Such a dam would be very likely to cause also some breaking of the 1. bank bunds. It may be noticed with regard to the flooding of the country from this part of the r. bank that the high banks of the old Melcha Canal, which below the loop S. of Ctesiphon runs roughly parallel with the river, at distances of 1-12 m. from it, are no longer an effective barrier to inundation, as they are broken in various places, the gaps being sometimes half a mile wide. Euphrates water could be used for flooding the country down to the Tigris. (See Appendix C.) As regards the r. bank below Bogheileh, Sir W. Willcocks suggests that by shutting off the Tigris at the Bogheileh bend, or at one of the two bends immediately below, or at all three, a great mass of water could be sent southward down the Bogheileh valley. This would have to force its way through the Euphrates opening below Nasirlyeh (see further p. 468), and would 'probably worry Nasirlyeh consider ably A dam in the Tigris below the head of the Shatt el-Hai would not send much water down to the Hai itself, but would pour water through an opening at the second bend below the bend at Bogheileh. The Country on the Left Bank. —Parallel with the Tigris from Diyaleh to Kut runs a depression liable to flood. To a point about 12 m. N. of 'Azlziyeh the raised bed of the old Nahrawan Canal runs along the northern side of this depression, at a somewhat higher level than the Tigris bank, and at distances of 10-16 m. from the river. North of Azlziyeh it turns in towards the Tigris. Considerable spills may take place from the left bank of the Tigris, and there are large patches of flood here in spring. In a high flood the country near the bank is reported to be so extensively inundated that it is only at three or four places that large dry areas can be counted on (Kut, Baghdadiyeh, and Ctesiphon are mentioned). The long line of marshes which, beginning near Beledruz, runs in a S. by E. direction and ends in the Khor Suweiklyeh N. and NE. of Kut, is fed almost wholly by streams from the Persian hills and by water from Diyaleh. But Tigris water from above Kut is believed to enter the Suweiklyeh in high flood, if bunds break. The depression lying along the left bank of the Tigris could be flooded both from that river and from the Diyaleh. The Nahrawan Canal, however, at least where it is above the Tigris levels, between the Diyaleh and Azlziyeh, affords ordinarily a dry road throughout the year, and would appear to be fairly safe from floods caused by breaching the Tigris or Diyaleh banks. It does not seem certainCONTROL OF TIGRIS WATER 453 that the Nahrawan would be safe from a flood caused by damming, for the water might then perhaps find its way through gaps or weak places in the high banks of the canal. The available evidence from surveys is not full enough to determine whether a dam on the Diyaleh near the head of the Beled- ruz Canal could send water along, or close to, the line of that canal, and thence into the depression of El-Merj and Suweiklyeh, so as to cause the flooding of the right bank of the Tigris near Kut. C onditions from K ut to K urna The main features of the river in this part of its course can only be very briefly sketched. From Kut to Amara the river is about 850 yds. broad with a depth of 26 ft. in flood and 5-7 ft. in low supply. The velocity of the current is generally about 3^-4^ m.p.h. in flood, and 1-1-| m.p.h. in low water. The river is navigable for steamers of 8-6 ft. draught according to the season. There are shifting sand-banks in the bed, especially between Sheikh Sa'ad and c Ali el-Gharbi. The height of the banks steadily diminishes. At Kut they are about 16 ft. above low-water levels; at Ali el-Gharbi, about 18 ft. ; at Amara, about 7 ft. In flood-time the overflow water forms marshes just beyond the immediate neigbourhood of the banks. These Mors become larger and more continuous as one goes down-stream. In a high flood there is an almost continuous line of marshes several miles wide from Sheikh Sa'ad on the right bank, and from Ali el-Gharbi to Amara on the left bank, where the Mors are also fed by streams from the hills. As the floods subside, the top of the water may filter back into the river: more water drains southward into the marshes below Amara, and much is lost by evaporation. The greater part of the marshland dries up in the course of the summer. On the right bank, 11 m. by river above Amara, is the large Biteireh Canal, which deprives the Tigris of water even in the low season, and may take perhaps rather more than a third of the river's supply. On the left bank immediately above Amara town is the common head of the Jehaleh (Chaheleh) and Musharreh canals. See further below on this canal-head. Beyond conservancy regulations to control canal-cutting, &amp;c., by the natives, there is little to be done to improve conditions on this part of the river, short of training it thoroughly by works on a con siderable scale. Merely local improvements might easily cause454 APPENDIX B worse conditions in reaches which before had presented no difficulty. Dredging is said to be useless, as in the stretch from Diyaleh to Kut (see p. 451). The marking out of the channel may improve depths, as the use of one channel by all crafts helps to prevent the silt from banking up. At least between Sheikh Sa'ad to Ali el-Gharbi the best channel is now marked out and buoyed. For the improvement of land communications, and the protection of limited areas, bunding is, of course, possible, but account must be taken of the probable effect of such work on the neighbourhood. Between Amara and Qdl'at Salih an enormous amount of water flows off into the great permanent marshes on either side of the river, so that whereas the discharge of the Tigris above Amara in h.w., 1916, was found to be 32,574 cusecs, its discharge at Qal'at Salih was only 4,003 cusecs. The Jehaleh-Musharreh head takes off not much less than half the water in the river, but a bar which has formed across it is believed to be an effective safeguard against a diversion of the river down the Jehaleh bed (which is lower than that of the Tigris). This bar acts as a natural weir, but a barrage with lock and regulators is needed for this canal. The principal canals below Amara are the Majarr el-Keblr on the right bank and the Michrlyeh on the left: these draw off water from the river even in low supply. The Majarr el-Keblr needs some kind of barrage, but in the summer of 1916 it was not considered worth while to con struct an emergency weir there immediately. The Michrlyeh was taking half the Tigris water, and it was recommended that a weir should be at once constructed at its head. For the rest, the prospects of improving the river on this stretch are apparently much the same as in the stretch from Kurna to Amara. From Qal'at Salih to Ezra'sTomh the Tigris flows through the 'Narrows', where it is reduced, by loss of water above, to a width of some 75 yds. Its depth is here about 13 ft, in high flood and about 5 ft. in low supply. Navigation is here more difficult than on any other stretch of the Lower Tigris. This difficulty is caused, not only by the narrowness of the channel, but also by the frequent sharp bends. Up to 1916 conditions had been made worse by the Arabs of the neighbourhood, who cut irrigation channels at the bends and threw -out brushwood groynes to reclaim land on a falling flood. It was recommended that these practices should be stopped, and that the narrowest channels should be dredged. The digging of new cuts across the bends would not be safe unless a careful survey had made it possible to foretell what would be the effect on the river fartherCONTKOL OF TIGRIS WATER 455 down -stream. The weir at the Michrlyeh head, if completed, may help to improve navigation below Qalat Salih, Sir William Willcocks in 1905 recommended training the river by willow mattresses and by massive blocks of fused brick. Between Ezra's Tomb and Kurna much of the water that had escaped from the Tigris above comes back into the river, which therefore broadens and deepens as Kurna is approached. Some of the Tigris water from the right bank also passes into the Hammar Lake or the Old Channel of the Euphrates, and rejoins the main stream (the Shatt el-'Arab) by one or other of the Euphrates mouths (either at Kurna or at Gurmat All). It may be observed that some of the conservancy measures mentioned above would temporarily affect the habits of the natives, who might make a grievance of this. N ote on S ir W. W illcocks' S cheme foe the C ontrol op the T igris W ater (1) For the fully developed control of the Tigris water the funda mental necessity is a system of works, including a barrage and an escape, at the head of the Tigris Delta between Samarra and Beled. The reasons for this are:— (i) In this neighbourhood the country begins to drop below the high flood level of the Tigris. At no lower point, therefore, would it be possible to insure against inundation by the Tigris floods. For such an insurance to be complete both a barrage and an escape are of course necessary. (ii) A diversion of Tigris water at this point would enable large quantities of the flood supply of the river to be stored either in the Tartar depression (SW. of Samarra), or in the depressions of Hab- baniyeh and Abu Dibs (SE. of Eamadiyeh), on the farther side of the Euphrates. Storage both of Euphrates and of Tigris flood-water on a great scale is absolutely essential to the development of the country, for Mesopotamian agriculture depends on perennial irriga tion (owing to the season at which the floods occur), and the low supply of the rivers is not nearly sufficient to support extensive cultivation both in the districts up-stream of Kut and Diwaniyeh, and farther south (the Shatt el-Arab country, &amp;c.). Another argument for such storage might be the extensive irrigation of Upper Mesopotamia, which, according to SirW. Willcocks, could conceivably deprive Irak of all the low supply of the Euphrates and a great part of the low supply of the Tigris, If Upper Mesopotamia were heavily irrigated by another Power, it would be necessary not only to store456 APPENDIX B flood-water for Irak, but also to have an agreement as to the division of the low supply between the two countries. (2) Sir William Willcocks suggests that the Tigris escape should lead from Istablat, about opposite the head of the old Qaim Canal, to the Tartar depression. If this depression, which has not yet been surveyed, should prove sufficiently large, a reservoir might be estab lished here which would support the irrigation of the country between the rivers from Baghdad to Babylon. If it is not large enough to store all the Tigris water available, the escape could be carried on to the Euphrates reservoir at Lake Habbaniyeh, with which would then be connected, for the purpose of storing the addi tional water from the Tigris, the much larger depression of Abu Dibs (S. of Habbaniyeh). It is to be observed that the Abu Dibs has its outlet at its south-eastern corner, towards Kerbela: it would probably, however, be possible to get enough water for the higher levels by an outlet from the north-eastern end of Habbaniyeh, and by arrange ments for raising the level of the water discharged from the south eastern end of Abu Dibs. An outlet from the north-eastern end of Habbaniyeh, though not originally planned by Sir W. Willcocks, was designed before the war, and approved by the Turkish Govern ment. By means of some such reservoirs. Sir W. Willcocks calculates that 18 milliards of cubic metres of water from the Tigris and Euphrates could be stored, of which 12 milliards could be used for irrigation (the rest would probably be lost by evaporation). He calculates the cost of a Tigris escape to Habbaniyeh, and of the new reservoirs in connexion with it, at £22,000,000. If the Tartar depiession should prove large enough to take the whole of the water from the Tigris, the cost would fall, he considers, to £12,000,000. It would seem difficult, however, to calculate what would be the cost of such works in the new conditions which will have been produced by the war. ( 3 ) T h e works in connexion with the Tigris, proposed by Sir vv . Willcocks in 1911, are enumerated below : but it must be borne in mind that they were planned on the assumption that the Tigris escape and reservoirs would be beyond the resources of the Turkish Government. They are, therefore, as Sir W. Willcocks himself says, only makeshifts. (i) The Beled Barrage, with the restoration of the Dujeil Canal system, irrigating the country between Beled and Baghdad. (ii) An embankment on the r. bank of the Tigris from opposite Mansuriyeh to Kazimain, and an escape at Moadhdham into the depression E. of Baghdad, with an outlet into the Tigris below/&lt; CONTROL OF TIGRIS WATER 457 Baghdad. In this way the Baghdad inundations, which without the Istablat escape and Tigris reservoirs would still continue, were to be limited. (iii) The disposal of the Diyaleh water. It is not necessary here to describe Sir W. Willcocks' alternative schemes for the Diyaleh. The principal difficulty in any such scheme appears to be that if Diyaleh water were to be used to irrigate another tract of country besides that which it at present supports through the Nahr Khalis (at present the best irrigated land in Mesopotamia), there would probably not be enough water for both areas in low supply. The main point, how ever, for present purposes is that in order to control the Diyaleh water it is necessary to hold the point where it breaks through the Hamrln hills. (iv) The country on the r. bank of the Tigris down to Kut to be irrigated by Euphrates water in the Right Tigris Canal: the banks of this canal to act as a dyke on this side of the Tigris : the surplus water to escape on the 1. bank (this provision again presupposes no escape at the head of the delta). (v) The Hai Canal to be restored and to be fed with Tigris water diverted by a barrage at Kut. (vi) The river in the marshes to be trained, and its chief canals regulated as already described. It is to be remembered that the developed irrigation of the country would mean the abandonment of navigation on the Tigris, as on the Euphrates. G- eneral C onclusions S ummarized The following main conclusions may be briefly recapitulated :— (i) To make sure, under the present circumstances, against the artificial flooding from the Tigris of the country on both sides of that river, it would be necessary to hold the head of the delta between Beled and Samarra. (ii) To make sure against the artificial flooding from the Euphrates of the country on the r. bank of the Tigris down to Kut, it would be necessary to hold the head of the Euphrates delta at Hit. (See further Appendix C.) (iii) To make sure against the artificial flooding from the Diyaleh of the country on both sides of that river, it would be necessary to go to the point where it leaves the Hamrln Hills. (iv) Apart from holding the rivers up to their deltas, the only counter measures to artificial flooding would be the protection of limited areas by hunds, and, if the levels made it possible, the pro-458 APPENDIX B vision of escapes for at least part of the water into areas where it would cause least harm. (v) Artificial flooding by the breaching of banks and would be easy almost anywhere when the river was in high flood. Dam ming could cause much more serious floods even in the low season, and could further ruin navigation down-stream, but it is on the whole' unlikely, though not impossible, that a work on a sufficient scale to produce such results could be carried out under war conditions. (vi) Little can be done at present for the improvement of the river. Palliative measures are most effective in the Narrows. For the thorough training of the river considerable works are necessary. (vii) For the full control of the Tigris water by a developed system of works such as a Power permanently occupying Irak could carry out, it would be necessary to hold the head of the Tigris delta between Beled and Samarra, and the Tartar depression. For the full control of the Diyaleh it would be necessary to hold its course up to a point where it issues from the Hamrln Hills and if it were found advisable to control the Adheim (not yet surveyed), it would be necessary, presumably, to hold the Band-iAdheim in the Hamrln Hills. (Local irrigation schemes, planned without reference to a general scheme for the country and based on partial surveys, are inadvisable. Compare p. 470 below.) (viii) The possession of the Euphrates up to Hit would be essential for the development of the country between the river from Felluieh to Kut (Appendix C).APPENDIX C THE CONTROL OF THE EUPHRATES WATER I ntroductory The main causes of the present condition of the lower Euphrates are, on the whole, similar to those which determine the condition of the lower Tigris (see p. 445). They may be summarized as follows (i) Insufficiency of the main bed (or beds) to hold the flood season discharge. (ii) Heavy floods, including sudden and violent rises m March, April, and May. (The river begins to rise in November, and con tinues to increase gradually up to February or March. Local rainfall has little effect on the Euphrates.) (iii) The presence of a great quantity of sediment in the stream, especially in flood-time. (iv) The nature of the soil of the delta : a soft alluvium. (v) The long neglect of adequate measures for irrigation and con servancy displayed by the Turkish Government in the past, and the primitive and ill-ordered methods of local irrigation practised by the Arabs. The following points may be noticed :— (a) The Euphrates floods are generally about a week later than those on the Tigris. (b) The flood discharge of the Euphrates is less than that of the Tigris. At Baghdad the Tigris at its highest may discharge for short periods 7,000 cubic metres per second. The highest discharge of the Euphrates at Hit is apparently about 4,500 cubic metres per second (or 4,000 cubic metres at Hindiyeh). The low supply of the Euphrates is greater than that of the Tigris. In the months of low water the discharge of the Tigris at Baghdad may amount to about three-quarters of the discharge of the Euphrates at Hit. (c) As a waterway the Euphrates is decidedly inferior to the Tigris. In the low season, under the best conditions at present possible, there can be no through steamer-traffic between the Hindiyeh Barrage and the Shatt el-Arab, nor even navigation by native craft of the larger kinds, unless they are very lightly loaded, and are ported in places.460 APPENDIX C The reasons for this inferiority of the Euphrates are:— (i) There is more dispersion of water in branch channels and marshes on the lower Euphrates than on the lower Tigris. (ii) The New Hindiyeh Barrage affects navigation down stream of it, and it and the Hilla Regulator can be used to interfere very seriously with navigation. Details are given below. It may be noticed here that the old Hindiyeh Barrage near the head of the Hindiyeh Branch effectively blocks navigation, while the locks on the New Barrage and the Hilla Regulator are not wide enough for the larger classes of river-steamer. (d) The remarks on the damming of the Tigris on pp. 447-448 are, in general, applicable to the Euphrates. But the following differences may be noticed :— (i) The Hindiyeh Barrage is a ready-made dam which can at any time be used for the diversion of water from the Euphrates up stream of it. (ii) The damming of the Hilla Branch would be easy at any season, as the water could always be shut off during the construction of the dam by the closing of the Hilla Regulator. (e) The ground-levels along the Euphrates fall from 40 to 19 metres above sea-level between Fellujeh and Diwaniyeh, while those on the Tigris fall from 34 to 17 metres between Baghdad and Kut. Between Diwaniyeh and Nasirlyeh the levels fall from 19 to about 3 metres at Nasirlyeh, and they range from about 3 to 2 metres between Nasiriyeh and the Shatt el- c Arab : whereas between Kut and Ezra's Tomb the Tigris levels range from 17 to 4 metres. An enormous amount of water leaves the right bank of the Tigris between Kut and Ezra's Tomb, and much of it finds its way into the Euphrates between Nasirlyeh and the Shatt el- e Arab. This inflow from the Tigris is one of the principal causes which have produced the great expanse of marsh and open water between Nasirlyeh and Gurmat c Ali. C onditions feom H it to the H indiyeh B akrage The river enters its delta at Hit, and thenceforward flows over a bed almost wholly of alluvium, though at first there are a few outcrops of rock in it. The width of the stream varies from 500 to 150 yds. The current at Hit is about 5 m.p.h. in high flood, and about 1/| m.p.h.^ in low water. This stretch of the Euphrates is navigable for river-steamers throughout the year, though until steamer-traffic had helped to clear the channel, navigation on some parts of it might be difficult in the low season. The Country on the Right Bank, —From Hit to the neighbourhoodCONTROL OF EUPHRATES WATER 461 of Museyib, the high ground of the Syrian desert runs not far from ''''ill the river. In places it is quite close to the bank, and it is never more than 5-6 miles away. The strip of country between the desert i aI1( j river is mostly below high flood level, and there are two ^ openings in the desert plateau down which in flood-time Euphrates water may make its way. These two openings are(i) that at lit, Ramadiyeh, leading to the Habbaniyeh Lake. This gap is about % 7-8 miles broad : its mouth contains two isolated patches of high ; ?j ground, the one behind, the other below, Ramadiyeh village. The opening affords a line for the Habbaniyeh Escape, which has its head immediately below Ramadiyeh, between the two patches of high iHn ground. The escape canal runs into the Habbaniyeh depression, a salt lake about 12 miles distant and about 11x7 miles in area, it» which has been fed from Euphrates overflows in the past, and is now 51; designed to serve as a storage reservoir. Up to the outbreak of the war no water had been let into the escape canal, as the outlet from tai the Habbaniyeh (on its NE. side) had not yet been cut; but some nil trouble was necessary to prevent the flood-water of the river from entering the canal, (ii) The second opening in the desert plateau 111 lies opposite the head of the Latlflyeh Canal, about 20 miles by river li above Museyib. It is about 5 miles broad at its mouth, and leads S. U to the Abu Dibs depression, about 25 miles distant. Overflows take fc place down this opening. ib A few miles north of Museyib the edge of the desert plateau turns il away from the Euphrates, running WSW., while the general direc- ii tion of the river is southerly. Below this point the plain of Kerbela 11 stretches from the right bank of the river for about 20 miles westwaid, iti to where the desert begins again behind Kerbela. ^ The central part I of this plain is watered mainly by the Nahr Huseiniyeh, which ^ e i aY i es ril the Euphrates a short distance below Museyib, and runs to Kerbela, 1 whence one of its branches passes by a gap in the high desert to the Abu Dibs Lake, while the other turns S. into the marshes known as the Khor Huseiniyeh. All the plain of Kerbela is below the high flood level of the Euphrates. . When the river is in high flood, the low ground adjoining its right bank between Hit and the Hindiyeh Barrage could be put under water at practically any point by a breaching of the bank or of the hunds. In the low season, the closing of the Hindiyeh Barrage, accompanied by a cutting of the bank up-stream, could flood the plain of Kerbela. Tlie Country on the Left Banlt. —From Hit to the head of the Saqla- wiyeh Canal there is a narrow but gradually widening strip of low ground between the left bank of the river and the edge of the )462 APPENDIX C Jtril Jezlreh desert, which is above flood level. East of Saqlawiyeh head is the southern end of the desert plateau of the Jezlreh, and down- stream of this, the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris is : for the most part below the high flood level of the Euphrates, which at Fellujeh is about 20 ft. higher than the Tigris at Baghdad. There V y, are, however, two considerable isolated patches of high-lying desert, ; . one W, of Fellujeh, between the Saqlawiyeh and the Abu G-horeib canals, the other just below the Latlfiyeh Canal opposite the second opening in the desert plateau on the right bank (see above, p. 461). The country between the Euphrates and the Tigris is watered by a number of large canals from the former. Of these the most . northerly is the Saqlawiyeh, already mentioned, the head of which is (or was before the war) blocked by an earthen dam. When this dam broke, as it sometimes did in the flood season, water entered the Saqlawiyeh and added to the flood area W. of Baghdad. It has been reported that in 1916 the Turks were using the canal as a waterway. A recent report states that the Saqlawiyeh is dammed only in very high flood. Before the war this was not the case : the fact may be that the Turks have now a regulator at its head. The most important of the other canals between the rivers are the Abu Ghoreib, the Eidhwanlyeh, the Mahmudiyeh, the Latlfiyeh, the Iskanderiyeh, and the Museyib. The first four of these extend to within a few miles of the Tigris between Baghdad and the loop south of Ctesiphon. Part of their water may actually reach the Tigris, as is reported of the Mahmudiyeh. All cross the Baghdad—Musevib road. J In normal high-water seasons there are floods along the left bank of the Euphrates (e.g. according to I.D. Sheet 2 C, between the i Ridhwanlyeh and the Mahmudiyeh), but the areas of inundation have been restricted by the damming of the Saqlawiyeh, by the . ■ placing of regulators at the heads of some of the larger canals (for example, the Abu Ghoreib and the Mahmudiyeh), and by the strengthening of the Euphrates bank at certain points by means of bunds (as between Fellujeh and Khan Maqdam, and at the very dangerous curve at Museyib, a flood from which would have serious consequences). The cutting of the left bank of the Euphrates could in high flood put under water almost the whole of the country between the rivers, from the southern edge of the main desert plateau southwards : the chief exceptions would be the isolated patches of high desert mentioned above. The opening of the head regulators on the larger canals in the flood season could also cause inundations. The closing of the Hindiyeh Barrage in the if ^CONTROL OF EUPHRATES WATER 463 accompanied by a breaching of the river bank above, would cause extensive floods in this region, but probably not such as would reach so far N. as Baghdad. The floods would probably extend to the Tigris about opposite Ctesiphon, and thence downwards. The closing of the Hindiyeh Barrage in the flood would cause such an alteration in conditions that it is impossible to say to what distance the results would make themselves felt. So large a volume of water would be diverted that it might quickly make itself a new river-bed, or beds, and thereby lessen the areas liable to flood. (The new bed, or beds, would probably discharge into the present Hilla Branch.) However, in any case, it is safe to say that the closing ot the barrage in the flood season would cause very widespread flooding: and it is fairly safe to predict that it would make a large belt of country between the Euphrates and the Tigris impracticable to a land-force operating between the two rivers above Kut. For the purpose of causing a flood to impede movement, the closing of the barrage in the high-water season would probably be an unnecessarily violent measure. It would be easier to direct water through particular breaches to particular areas by the quantity passing through the barrage. C onditions from the H indiyeh B aerage to S amaweh The Hindiyeh Barrage and the Hilla the Hindiyeh Barrage the Euphrates bifurcates into two great branches (the Hindiyeh and the Hilla), which meet again 2-8 miles above Samaweh. It appears that from very early times some such division of the Euphrates has existed, the mam volume of water having passed at some periods down the western, at others down the eastern branch. Some forty years ago the Hilla Branch carried by far the greater supply and was known as the Euphrates , while the Hindiyeh was only a 'canal'. Then the Hindiyeh head gradually widened (partly as the consequence of the closing ot the Saqlawiyeh), till it took the larger portion of the river water. This process continued, until the Hilla Branch was left dry m the low season. The Turkish Government constructed a weir (the Old Barrage'), about f mile below the site of the New Barrage. But this weir burst in 1903, and failed to check the drying of the Hilla Branch, though it continued to be (and probably still is) an obstacle to navigation. The New Barrage, completed in 1913, lies about 6 miles below Museyib. The old head of the Hilla, situated about464 APPENDIX C 600 yds. below the New Barrage, has been blocked by an earthen dam, and a new head, with a regulator, has been made about i mile above the New Barrage. The old bed of the Hilla, behind the new dam, contained water in 1914 It joins the new bed about 2± below the regulator. The Old Hindiyeh Barrage is a weir of stone rubble which in 1914 had a narrow breach near the centre and another near the 1. bank. No craft could pass it up-stream except in flood, when empty native boats of 20—30 tons could be hauled over at some risk. In low water 1914 the difference of water-level above and below the weir was 3-4 ft. The current through the breaches was then too strong to allow craft to be hauled up with any safety. In high water so long as there was 4-5 ft, of water over the weir loaded craft of 20—30 tons could with some risk be floated over it down-stream. In low water the passage down-stream was too dangerous for any but the smallest craft/ The New Hindiyeh Barrage is a straight dam 275 yds, long, provided with 36 gates or openings, 9 ft. 10 in. wide, so that the height of the water held up can be controlled. At the east side is a lock 26 ft. 3 in. wide, 180 ft, long, and spanned by a lift bridge. The barrage was built wholly on the left bank of the Euphrates, which was then diverted to the present channel, the old channel being stopped with an earthen dam at the end of the barrage. This new barrage forms a bridge suitable for fairly heavy artillery. The builders used to run 10-15 ton locomotives over it. The Hilla Regulator, which is about 140 ft. long, forms a similar bridge over the new head of the Hilla Branch, At the W, end of the regulator is a navigable opening 26 ft. 3 in, wide, spanned by a lift bridge. Navigation on the Hindiyeh and Hilla Branches. —It will have been noticed that the Old Barrage (as it was in 1914, and probably still is) would practically stop navigation into or out of the Hindiyeh Branch. Even if this were destroyed no river steamers of broad beam could pass through the navigation lock on the New Barrage. Already before the war the normal regulation of water at the New Hindiyeh Barrage had affected the navigation of the river as far down as the Hammar Lake, where depths were sensibly decreased. The New Hindiyeh Barrage when fully open has a capacity of about 4,000 cubic metres per second, the Hilla Regulator a capacity of 150 cubic metres at most. In the low-water season the Hilla Branch could be made to take about two-fifths of the Euphrates discharge by closing as far as possible the Hindiyeh Barrage and keeping the regulator open to its full capacity. In the flood season,CONTROL OF EUPHRATES WATER 465 on the other hand, the Hilla Branch could not take off any ap preciable quantity of the Euphrates discharge. The results for navigation are:— (i) On the Hindiyeh Branch. The Hindiyeh Barrage being open, the Hindiyeh Branch would be practicable during most of the high -w season for craft drawing 3-34 ft., but there is a short period after the flood begins to go down when navigation is stopped owing to the silt in the channels of the Bahr -i-Shinafiyeh, which two or three weeks later are scoured out again. In low water the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh would be impracticable for any vessels of greater draught than small or large hellams laden to one-third of their capacity. The closing of the Hilla Regulator in low water would improve navigation on the Hindiyeh: in the flood season the closing of the regulator would make no appreciable difference to the Hindiyeh. By the closing of the Hindiyeh Barrage the Hindiyeh Branch can be deprived of water to a sufficient degree to prevent navigation on certain stretches. This could be done by closing the barrage to its safe limit (i. e. so as not to endanger the country up-stream) and opening the Hilla Regulator to its full capacity. In the flood season the Hindiyeh Barrage could not be closed so as to stop navigation without causing a disastrous flood. (ii) On the Hilla Branch. The Hilla Branch can be deprived of water, and all navigation on it can be stopped, by the closing of the Hilla Regulator, both in flood-time and in low water. When in the low-water season the Hilla Regulator is fully open and the Hindiyeh Barrage is closed to its safe limit, navigation on the Hilla Branch would be possible from its head to Samaweh. Any steamers that could pass through the lock of the Hilla Regulator could get from there to Biwaniyeh: whether they could navigate below Diwaniyeh is not known. If the Hilla Regulator were fully open in the flood season, the Hilla Branch would be navigable, but if there was an exceptional rise, the country fed by the Hilla Branch would probably be flooded. The Hindiyeh Branch as far as Kifl is about 200 yds. broad. It bifurcates below Kifl into the Kufeh and Shamiyeh channels, which both discharge into the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh. ^ The Shamiyeh Channel (to east) is the better for navigation. It is about 150 yds. wide except where islands reduce its breadth to 50 yds. ^ Navigation is hampered here and there by native dams. The Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh is a great reedy lake, which has for years been steadily silting up, and takes a large part of the Euphrates sediment. In the low season MES. II G g466 APPENDIX C li it is diy in sonio parts and V6ry shallow elsewhere. At its southern outlet near Shinafiyeh is a bar. Below the lake ? about 12 miles down-stream of Shinafiyeh, the navigation channel leaves the old main arm of the Hindiyeh Branch, and makes a detour to N., passing through marshes by the Shatt Khansar, a difficult and tortuous channel 80-100 yds. wide. The Shatt Khansar leads back to the river about 5 miles above Samaweh. The Hilla Branch has a better defined bed, but one very liable to silt up quickly, as the current is slow. As explained above, the main stream of the Euphrates used to pass this way, and has left a broad river-bed, at least as far down as Diwaniyeh : but the present channel of the Hilla Branch, within the old bed, is narrow. It is only 90—95 yds. wide near Diwaniyeh, and only 40-45 yds. wide between Imam Hamzeh and Samaweh. The GouutTy yVsst of the Hiftdiych JBTdftch, —From the barrage to about 5 miles above Kufeh the right bank of the Hindiyeh Branch (or Kufeh Channel below Kifi) is bordered by a belt of plain, at first about 20 miles broad, but narrowing to about 6-7 miles in the neighbourhood of Tawarlj (Hindiyeh) and below. On the W., the plain is bounded by the desert. It is well watered, and in parts is liable to be flooded, by some large canals from the Euphrates, and probably most of it is below high flood level. From about 5 miles above Kufeh to a point about 10 miles below that town the right bank of the Kufeh Channel is bordered by a long wedge of desert plateau, on which Nejef stands. On the farther side of this promontory of desert is the depression known as the Bahr-i-Nejef. Below the southern end of the promontory the right bank of the Kufeh Channel sinks again, and water in flood-time passes from it into the Bahr-i-Nejef to NW. About 18 miles south of Kufeh lies the northern end of the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh. On the western side of the hahr, near the oases of Eahbeh, Ain Biyar, and c Ain Ederi, the ground seems to be fairly low, but it is not known how far a high flood might reach. SW. of ihelahr the adjoining ground seems to be higher. Below the Bahr-i-Shinafiyeh the desert plateau is not far from the old main arm of the Hindiyeh, which, as explained above, lies south of the present navigation channel, divided from it by marshes. . The Countfy between the Branches. —This country is a plain which is apparently commanded almost everywhere by the flood levels of the Hilla and the Hindiyeh. As far down as Shamiyeh and Diwaniyeh, the two branches are on about the same levels (both diopping from 81—32 metres to 18—19 metres): and the interveningCONTROL OF EUPHRATES WATER 467 country forms a slight depression between them. No levels have been surveyed below Shatniyeh and Diwaniyeh. . ... Bv far the greater part of the flood-area in this region is to be found along the Hindiyeh, the banks of whose channels (e. g. the Shamiyeh and Khansar) are generally low and marshy, and wll ? re not cultivated are often much overgrown with reeds. The_ succession of swamps along the Hindiyeh, beginning with the Khor Bainyeh between Tawarlj. and Kifl, and ending with the Khors Uwameh and Allah near Samaweh, would seem to present such serious obstacles that any movement by land between, or immediately W. ot, tne channels through which this branch flows, would be m some parts and seasons quite impossible, in others very difficult: but the whole of this country is very imperfectly known. The banks of the Hilla are generally fairly high. The supply in this branch is comparatively small, and much of it normaily passes down large canals from the left bank. It is probable that the country alongside the right bank of the Hilla could not be floode , except in quite small areas, unless both the stream itself and some of the large canals on the left bank had first been dammed, it has been explained above that it would be easy to dam the Hilla at any 'hid season, .. j . ^ ^ The Country E. of the Hilla Branch— normal years water finds its way through a number of large canals from the right bank of the TTillfl. (e.g. the Dighareh and the Yusufiyeh or Shatt el-Khar) and forms large marshes in the interior of the plain (e.g. the Knor Afei fed by the Dighareh, and the Khor Huseimyeh or Butnijeh, N. of Nasirlyeh, fed by the Khar). By damming the Hilla and turning its supply down any of its canals, fioods might e cause m the plain as far as the Tigris and the Shatt el-Hai. See further pp. 451-452. Samaweh—N asi riyeh The Euphrates here flows in one stream. Its width between Samaweh and Duraji is said to vary from 50 to 120 yds.: below Duraji it is said to widen out to 300 yds. at Nasirlyeh. (So Lorimer, 1908: a Report of 1912-13 gives the width between Nasmyeh and Samaweh as 150-200 yds.) Navigation is easy. _ (After the capture of Nasirlyeh, in the late summer of 1915, a British gunboat went up to Samaweh: no details of the journey were available lor this Report.) The banks from Samaweh to Duraji are said to be about /-i4 it. above low-water level: down-stream of Duraji they are appaien y lower. a g 2468 APPENDIX C (0 . 9 n the right bank there is a narrow strip of land which is irrigated from the river, but the higher ground of the desert is nowhere more than a few miles away. The low ground is apparently in general liable to flood. (The country between the river and Tel Mughaiyir (Ur) S. of Nasirlyeh is certainly liable to inundation: no definite information is available for other parts.) On the left bank down to Duraji the neighbouring country could probably be inundated from the river or the Hilla Branch, but no levels have been surveyed. Below Duraji the country N. of the river appears to be normally more marshy. The neighbourhood of Nasirlyeh is flooded in high water partly from the adjoining reaches of the Euphrates, but also from the Hilla Branch (the water ot which flows into the Khor Huseiniyeh), and from the Tigris. Tigiis water comes down to the neighbourhood of Nasirlyeh not only from Kut (see following section) but also from the marshes in the Amara district. The breaching of the right bank of the Tigris above Kut would probably in the flood season send a certain amount of water into the Euphrates above Nasirlyeh, through the Huseiniyeh (Butnijeh): but see below, p. 469. Sir W. Willcocks re commends that to meet this every trace of a bank S. of the Euphrates should be removed, channels should be opened, and as much water as possible allowed to escape in flood. He considers that Nasirlyeh could not be drowned out by sending water in excess down the Hai, as the latter is a poor carrying channel and very high-lying. The excess water would probably flow out of the Hai. ' Eeasonable pro tective banks ' at Nasirlyeh could settle every difficulty. On the complicated and variable conditions on this part of the Euphrates, satisfactory information cannot at present be given. (ct) Ndsinyeli NcigJiboutiwod of S uq —On this stretch the river is J 50-200 yds. wide. The current is 2|-3i m. p. h. Depths are ample at all seasons. On the right bank there are extensive marshes, and in flood-time the water may find its way far into the desert between Nasirlyeh and Khamlslyeh. Across the area which is liable to flood the railway from Basra runs on an embankment. On the left bank, behind a fringe of .swcM-protected date groves iiere coiuu prooaoiy oe artmcially increased not only from the Nasietyeh—KubnaCONTROL OF EUPHRATES WATER 469 Euphrates, but also from the Tigris above Kut (see pp. 452, 468). A breach in the Tigris bank above Kut would probably send water in the flood season W. of the Shatt el-Hai to the neighbourhood of Shatret el-Muntefiq, below which the greater part of it would probably follow the direction of the water from the Shatt el-Hai, i. e. SE. and SSE. towards the Euphrates below Nasirlyeh. [b] Neighbourhood of S iuj csh-Shuyulth — —In the neighbourhood of Suq esh-Shuyukh the river-water is dispersed in a maze of channels. The ground along and near their banks is often comparatively high and capable of cultivation, while in the middle of an area between channels there is generally a swampy reed-grown depression. Where the channel-banks are not cultivated they are generally fringed with reed-beds. The flood water of the river forms large Miors in the country to N. (where, as explained above, it is joined by water from the Shatt el-Hai and the Amara marshes), while to S. the floods spread out into the country N. and E. of Khamlslyeh. The distribution of the water between Suq esh-Shuyukh and the Hammar has been continually changing as the result of floods, Arab irrigation, and silting. The best navigation channel to the Hammar was until recently the Grurmat Safheh (the ' Haqiqeh' Channel, now closed), the head of which is about 2 miles up-stream of Suq esh-Shuyukh. Of the other principal channels, the Ma Sha'lreh (or Mujaihishlyeh) and Rufadlyeh, to N. of the Gurmat es-Safha, are apparently fit only for motor- boats or light bellams even in high water. The Mezlaq leading from Suq esh-Shuyukh was only fit for m (or large in high water. There was a very bad bar at its mouth (E. end). The work of opening it for navigation was undertaken towards the end of 1916, and it was intended to be ready for traffic in January 3917. The Haqiqeh Dam was situated on the Haqiqeh Channel about 5 miles above the entrance to the Hammar Lake. The dam was destroyed by the British in 1915 in order to open a waterway to Nasirlyeh. A navigation-channel 75 ft. wide was thus formed at the site of the dam. In high water the current flowed through this opening with great force, and upgoing steamers and boats had to be hauled up with ropes. The sharp turns at this point increased the difficulty of navigation. The Haqiqeh Dam held up sufficient water for the irrigation of the neighbouring country (where rice is the principal crop), and its destruction has resulted in a restriction of the area capable of cultivation on both sides of the channel. To remedy this damage these proposals have been made :—470 APPENDIX C (i) To construct a canal parallel with the Haqiqeh Channel, which would feed the distributaries which the Haqiqeh now cannot adequately supply. This would affect the land on one bank only of the Haqiqeh, for a length, it is believed, of not more than 4 miles. On the other hand, the cost would be considerable, as the new canal would cross five large distributary cuts, at each of which masonry regulators would be needed. This scheme has therefore been dropped. (ii) To reconstruct the Haqiqeh Dam and open out the Mezlaq Channel for navigation. This plan seems to have been adopted, as the Haqiqeh Channel is reported closed (Jan. 1917). (iii) To reconstruct the Haqiqeh Dam and build a navigation lock in it. This was thought to be of doubtful expediency, as it would certainly impede navigation, and the channel would tend to silt up above the dam. It is not included in a list of river-works begun, or about to be begun, in October 1916. It may be observed with regard to irrigation that in a country which, like Mesopotamia, is to depend on a irrigation scheme, it is unwise to begin with a purely operation, based on the survey of a particular district. Such an operation may adversely affect conditions elsewhere, and may interfere with, or be rendered useless by, the general scheme subsequently adopted. (c) The Hammar Lake. —Some 10 miles (in a direct line) ENE. of Suq esh-Shuyukh is the Hammar Lake, extending about 12 miles from W. to E., and about 4-5 miles between the rows of island-villages in date groves on its N. and S. sides. Beyond these island-villages is marsh-land (open water and reed beds) to N., and the great Ichor of the 'New Channel' of the Euphrates to S. The depths of the Hammar Lake have been affected by the building of the New Hindiyeh Barrage. At present its depths vary from about 7 ft. in high water to 1 ft. 6 in. at lowest water (see Table below, p. 472). It is proposed to dredge the lake (see below, under The Hammar Lake is fed partly by the Euphrates water, which enters it by various channels on the W., partly from the Shatt el- Hai, by the Nahr Beidhaand Nahr Hamzeh, on the NW., and partly from the Tigris to NE. So much water enters it on its N. side that the general direction of its current is from N. to S. (d) From the Hammar Lake toKurna Gurmat 'Ali. —The Hammar discharges its water partly eastwards, but mainly south- eastwards and southwards. While some of the water follows the ' Old Channel' past Chubeish and Medineh to Kurna, by far the greater part flows through channels between the islands on the S. side of the lake into the great open of the ' New Channel' thatCONTKOL OF EUPHRATES WATER 471 extends S. to the edge of the high ground of the desert, and south- eastwards to Gurmat Ali. 't i i -i I The Old Channel is fed not only from the Hammar, but also to some extent from the Tigris marshes to N. It is practicable for steamers of 5 ft. draught. At Chubeish is a bar on which depths m August 1916 sank to 2 ft., and in October, with a to as low as 1 ft. 3 in. In November 1916 the depth on this bar was brought up to 7 ft. by dredging. There is cultivation along a great part of both banks, but behind a narrow cultivated fringe are great stretches of reedy marsh land. , , , „ . The Ehor of the New Channel. —This is a great sheet ot open water fed principally from the Hammar Lake, but partly also, it would seem, from the marshes to W. of it that lie N. of Khamlsiyeh, and partly by cuts from the Old Channel. In the flood season steamers can cross this Tihor from its mouth at Gurmat Ali to the Hammar Lake. Maheilehs and heliums can reach to Mezlaq Channel from it by the Umm Naklah cut. The Moris practicable for small craft (e.g. lellams and motor-boats) throughout the year. On its southern side towards the desert its edges are, on the whole,^ shallow and often reed-grown, but there are places where in flood-time boats can come close inshore. The main outlet of the Mor is at Gurmat 'All, where its water passes into the Shatt el-Arab, but in past flood-seasons it has spilt much water into the depression between Basra and Zobeir. This spill is now held up by the new Sha'aibeh Ijund. (The floods W. of Basra were also fed by water coming from the Shatt el- c Arab below Basra: the Zobeir bund, when completed, will act as a barrier against this inundation.) # _ , , {e) As regards improvements on the river between JNasiriyen and Kurna, little seems possible beyond dredging, the marking of channels, and ordinary conservancy regulations against unauthorized canal-cutting and damming by the Arabs. Dredging here can be fairly effective, as, though of course silting goes on, the amount deposited is much less than higher up the river, a great quantity of sediment having been taken off higher up (e.g. in the Bahr-i- Shinafiyeh). It appears that the most difficult reaches on this stretch are being, or are about to be, thoroughly surveyed.472 APPENDIX C Water-Levels. Aug.-Dec. 1916. Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov.

The rise on that date was said to be curious, as there was no corresponding rise in the gauge readings at Nasiriyeh, though between Oct. 27 and Nov. 4 there had been a rise of 2| in. at Nasiriyeh. (The rise in the Hammar on Nov. 7 may have been due to Tigris water.) After Nov. 20 the Euphrates had begun to rise slowly. S ir W illiam W illcocks ' S cheme for the C ontrol of the E uphrates W ater The full control of the Euphrates, both for prevention of excessive floods and for irrigation, must depend on a system of barrage and escape near the head of its delta. Provision has further to be made for the water diverted by the escape. The storage of flood-water is necessary for the development of Irak, as water is needed for the crops in the summer months of low supply, when the amount actually in the rivers is not nearly enough for the thorough irrigation of the country. The heavy irri gation of Upper Mesopotamia would increase the need of Irak for great quantities of stored water. If another Power held and irrigated Upper Mesopotamia an agreement would be necessary as to the division of the low supply : for the whole of the low supply of the Euphrates, and much of that of the Tigris, could be cut off from Irak by irrigation works farther N. In 1911 Sir William Willcocks mentioned a point below Fellujeh, near the head of the Abu Ghoreib Canal, as a suitable site for aCONTEOL OF EUPHRATES WATER 473 barrage. But in 1916 he expressed a preference for a point near the Saqlawiyeh dam, up-stream of Fellujeh there is^ here an out crop of limestone in the stream-bed, which gives a solid foundation. The Habbaniyeh Escape would take off water above the barrage into the Habbaniyeh depression. (For the Euphrates water alone the Habbaniyeh Keservoir miglit be sufficient. On the possibility of using both it and the Abu Dibs depression for the storage of the combined excess water of the Euphrates and the Tigris, see p. 456.) The other works which Sir W. Willcocks proposed tor the Euphrates in 1911 might, he now considers, 4 be carried out as designed, remembering that everything was designed for a really poor countryBut it appears that the storage of Tigris water either in the Tartar depression or in reservoirs at Habbaniyeh and Abu Dibs may make it necessary to remodel the scheme for Euphrates irrigation. The works which he suggested may be summarized as follows (i) The Saqlawiyeh Canal to be restored and to be used as a feeder for a canal-system along the r. bank of the Tigris down to Kut. (ii) A canal along the 1. bank of the Euphrates from above the new barrage to the head of the Iskanderiyeh, feeding canals (Abu Ghoreib, Eidhwanlyeh, Upper Melcha, Latlfiyeh) running westwards to the depression between the Tigris and the Euphrates, which would serve as a drain. (iii) The Kutha Canal taking off SSE. from the Latlfiyeh, to water the interior of the country between the upper part of the Hilla Branch and the Tigris, towards the Shatt en-Nil. From the Kutha, a western branch (the Babylon Canal) leading towards Hilla. (iv) Canals along the r. and 1. banks of the upper part of the Hindiyeh Branch, for the irrigation of the Tawarlj district. (v) The use of the present M iot above Gurmat Ali for the irriga tion of the Basra district. For this purpose the water in the Tdior must be held up in low supply by a barrage at Gurmat Ali. In order to prevent the increased amount of water behind the barrage from spreading over so wide an area that its evaporation would nullify the effect of the barrage, the Euphrates water, according to this scheme, would be shut off from the Hammar Lake and the Old Channel by a dam at Suq esh-Shuyukh, and its water would all pass down to Gurmat c Ali, being confined on the N. by a bank from Suq esh-Shuyukh to Kurna. This bank would run to the Hammar Lake, along the S. side of the lake (presumably along the present line of islands), and thence along the S. bank of the Old Channel. Thus the Hammar Lake and the Old Channel would be fed with Tigris water only, while the Euphrates water would be concentrated in the (g) &gt;474 APPENDIX C area to the S., in the present Ichor of the New Channel, and when held up by the Gurmat 'Ali barrage would not be able to spread r northwards into the Tigris marshes. G eneral C onclusions S ummarized (i) For the thorough control of the lower Euphrates, both in order to prevent excessive floods and to use its water for extensive irrigation, it is necessary to hold it up to the head of its delta at Hit. (ii) Local irrigation schemes, planned without reference to a general scheme for the country and based on partial surveys, are inadvisable. (iii) Nearly all the country between the Tigris and the Euphrates from Baghdad to the Shatt el-Hai can be inundated in the flood season from the Euphrates above Diwaniyeh, The Hindiyeh Barrage could be used in the low-water season as a dam m order to flood the country through a breach up-stream of it. The Hilla Branch could be easily dammed at any season. (iv) The Euphrates and its neighbourhood from above Nasirlyeh to Kurna is liable to be flooded from the Tigris. Water from the Tigris above Kut can be sent down to the neighbourhood of Nasirlyeh. (v) The lower Euphrates is on the whole ill-suited to navigation, chiefly owing to the great dispersion of its waters, and consequent shallowness in parts, so that steamers and fully laden native craft of the larger kinds cannot ascend to the Hindiyeh Barrage in low water. Further, the Old Hindiyeh Barrage blocks navigation, while the New Barrage and the Hilla Regulator are impassable for the larger class of river steamers. Thirdly, the New Barrage and Kegulator can so be used, without flooding the country up-stream of them, as to make either the Hindiyeh Branch or the Hilla Branch quite unnavigable in the low season, and the Hilla Branch un- navigable m the flood season. The Hindiyeh Branch could be made unnavigable in the flood season only at the cost of a most disastrous inundation. (vi) The river between Nasiriyeh and Kurna, parts of which have peen found to be very shallow in the low-water season, can be improved for navigation by dredging. 3 ^9 m) CONTROL OF EUPHRATES WATER 475 N ote on N ative C raft on E uphrates The following information is from a Report of 1916, Maheikhs. None used on Euphrates. (It this is true, the craft called maheilehs in other reports on the lower Euphrates are probably large bellams.) Large bellams, 9-18 tons, 270. Large hetlams, 18-60 tons, 230. ^ . . , AAA Dandks (large bitumen-covered canoes, 9-11 tons), 5, UUU. ShaMdurs. Large numbers can be built at Jeraulus (or liinji j. Down-stream of Museyib nearly all the native craft are in Arab hands The 5,000 danaks are fully worked, and it would be difficult for an enemy to get hold of any considerable number of these shallow-draught craft, which .could and would be got away by the Arabs into inaccessible marshes. Moreover, they are very slow and unsuitable for supply work. . ... The wood for building a further supply of large hellams is not locally available, but the existing tonnage of this class is fairly considerable, amounting to about 12,500 tons. However, the Turks do not appear to have collected these bellams, and collection on a large scale would probably lead to a good deal of fighting with the inhabitants. Maheilehs and large hellams are built at Basra and Mohammareh. Only dandks are built at Suq esh-ShuyQkh, Samaweh, Shmafiyeh, Umm el-Ba'rur, and Hindiyeh.APPENDIX D THE OIL-FIELDS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE PEKSIAN FRONTIEK P osition and P rospects of P etkolifeeous A reas , ^ 1 ' &lt; ? m r i lie - P ® rsla . n to Kirkuk there extends, among the hills of the Turco-Persian borderlands, a belt of country which is in some parts certainly, in others probably, petroliferous. At present oil is worked on this belt, (a) in the Shushtar district, where the Maidan-i-Naftun wells of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company produce on a considerable scale, and (b) comparatively slightly in the Kirkuk Qasr-i-Shlrln—Mandali area. Much of Luristan, lying between these two worked areas, is probably petroliferous, and oil is actually found on the surface in a tew places. It is to be noticed that at its southern end the belt is continued by the oil-bearing region which lies N. of the Persian Gulf. (2) The Tigris valley between the Hamrln Hills and Mosul is petroliferous. The deposits in this area may be connected (along the mu i } Wlth the Kirku k—Qasr-i-Shinn oil-district. (d) ihe Euphrates valley from Hit up to the neighbourhood of eir-ez-Zor is petroliferous. Oil also occurs in the desert S. of Nasinyeh (Tel Mughaiyir), and may be present elsewhere in the country E. and S. of the Lower Euphrates. Lastly, it is to be noticed that the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf is in parts petroliferous {e.g. at Koweit and at Bahrein). ,, ^ -Redwood in his work on Petroleum (3rd edition, 1913) describes the oil-bearing belt of Mesopotamia as running from Hit to Deir th^V f K t0 1 , f ? ar ^ 01 N - of Zakho, 'and eastward (?) from this hue to beyond the Persian frontier'. (The last phrase seems t0 ^ Kirkuk -Qasr-i-ShlrIn-Mandali tnnkraf f • the 0ll - bearin g country reaches from the Euphrates to the Tigris across the Jezlreh (in the neighbourhood it would seem of the Sinjar hills) appears to rest on the fact that the fw fl! condlfclons ^fke the presence of oil not improbable, and hat the usual concomitants of oil, salt and sulphurous waters, areOIL-FIELDS 477 found in this part of the Jezlreh. On the other hand, no record has been found of an actual appearance of oil or bitumen, and at any rate it would seem that such appearances are slight, as most authorities do not notice them. Professor J. W. Gregory in a Keport on the Geology of Mesopotamia does not describe the oil-bearing country as stretching from Euphrates to Tigris: indeed Redwood's own map of the oil-fields of the world does not mark petroliferous deposits across the JezTreh (it is true that it also omits the Tigris area). (5) Oil is an uncertain quantity. Geological examination of the ground can indeed tell whether the conditions are favourable to its presence, but even when such conditions exist, if oil has not appeared on the surface or been struck by testing, it cannot be told how large the supply may be. Again, where crude oil is known to exist the economic value of its quality cannot be told without expert inspection and analysis. And lastly, when a well, or group of wells, is actually working and producing abundant oil, it is impossible to say how long the supply will last. In Mesopotamia and the adjoining Persian borderland there are very large areas where the presence of oil is known or suspected. But the examination of it is very incomplete. Thorough examination and testing is being carried out in the Shushtar district, and the country round Qasr-i-Shlrln seems to have been fairly carefully inspected. So far as such examination goes, the prospects here seem to be on the whole encouraging. Elsewhere, thorough examina tion has taken place only at a very few, scattered points: for the most part there is only a presumption from the general geological structure of the country and from indications of oil on the surface. There is indeed a good chance that, in such a large region that is certainly or probably petroliferous, more or less valuable oil-fields will be discovered at one point or another: but where they will appear, it seems impossible to say. T he S hushtak A rea General The oil-producing area round Shushtar is of course only a small section of the great belt of more or less petroliferous country which extends from S. of Mosul to the Persian Gulf. It is, however, the only part of this belt in which successful exploitation by modern European methods has as yet taken place on a considerable scale. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's producing field is at Maidan- i-Xuftun, a plain among low gypsum hills, some 26-30 miles SSE. of478 APPENDIX D Shushtar. The oil-wells here are connected by a pipe-line, 150 miles long, running down the left side of the Karun past Wais and Ahwaz, with the refinery at 'Abbadan, situated on Abbadan Island, upon the left bank of the Shatt el- Arab, some 35 miles above its mouth. The Company has also sunk wells at Ahwaz and Neft-i-Safid ('White Oil Springs', some 36-40 miles SSE. of Shushtar). The Company's geologists are examining other fields, and the reports are said to be promising. It is not known where these experiments have been conducted, but it seems very probable that there is much oil throughout the gypsum and sandstone country, the ranges of which run NW.-SE. between the plains of Arabistan and the high Bakhtiyari mountains. Oil and bitumen are collected by the natives at various springs: e. g. at Mesjid-i-Suleiman, 4 miles NE. of Maidan-i-Naftun, and at Shardin, 8 miles E. of Ramuz (Ram Hormuz). Commercial The Anglo-Persian Oil Company holds a concession giving it the exclusive right to bore for oil in Persia, except in the northern provinces of Azarbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Astarabad, and Khorasan. In view of the importance of establishing a Government-controlled oil-field for supplying the needs of the Royal Navy, &amp;c., the British Government has invested heavily in the Company, and in consi deration of this financial support conditions have been made in order to give the Government a voice in the direction of the Com pany's general policy, and in the supervision of the further develop ment of the concession. Apart from small operations in the Qasr-i-Shlrin district intended merely to supply the local market (see p. 482, below), the Company's production has been limited entirely or almost entirely to the Maidan-i-Naftun field. Borings have taken place elsewhere, e .g. at Ahwaz and at Neft-i-Safid, but it appears that production for export has not yet been attempted at these places. At Maidan-i-Naftun an area of about 6-| square miles has been proved , and it is hoped that eventually 350—400 wells may be drilled there. The difficulty so far has been that the few wells already tapped have yielded much more oil than could be carried by the pipe-line or stored at the refinery: so that, great quantities of oil had to be burnt. In 1914 two wells alone, though shut downOIL-FIELDS 479 as far as possible, produced almost all the oil exported. Drilling operations during the last few years have therefore been restricted. This drawback will be lessened by the increase in the size of the pipe-line, and by the extension at the c Abbadan refinery, and at the end of 1916 it was reported that active drilling for reserve production had been resumed. The directors then stated that the wells from which supplies are being drawn continue to give most satisfactory yields, and are more than maintaining their former production. There is a pumping-station on the Tembih river some 2^ miles SW. of the wells. The pipe-line in 1914 was 6 in. in diameter as far as Wais, and Sin. thence onwards, and had an estimated capacity of 1,000 tons daily. (One well alone was then producing more than that on an average.) A 10-in. line was completed in August 1916 as far as Wais, and is to be continued to 4 Abbadan. Delay in the construction of the line was due to the damage done by Persian tribesmen in 1915 (which led to the closing of the line refinery for 4^ months), and to the scarcity of labour and transport. However, at the end of December 1916 it was expected that the whole length of the 10-in. line down to the refinery would be working 6 within a few weeks . The old pipe-line had gate-valves 10 miles apart, and stations at intervals of 20 miles for keeping an hourly record of pressure, in order to detect leakage. It is not known what arrangements of this kind are to be found on the new line. The refinery at 'Abbadan has storage capable of holding at least 60,000 tons of crude oil and 50,000 tons of refined oil. Probably the storage capacity is considerably greater, as extensions have recently been completed, and further extensions were in progress at the end of last year (1916). e Abbadan has a wireless station, and is connected by telephone with Maidan-i-Naftun. The oil and bitumen springs exploited by natives are worked (if they are still worked at all) by primitive methods, and the amount and the quality of their production are insignificant. Thus in 1913 it was reported that at the three principal springs of Mesjid-i- Suleiman, near Maidan-i-Naftun, not more than 30 gallons daily of a dark green oil were collected by the Seyyids of Shushtar, and the oil was used mainly for anointing camels against the mange. The crude material was said to contain 27 per cent, of illuminating oil and 45 per cent, lubricating oil. At Shardin, near Ramuz, are ten springs of dark oil, the three principal springs yielding 25 gallons daily.480 APPENDIX D liifetfl Communications The Maidan-i-Naftun oil-wells, and the surrounding petroliferous area, are surrounded by alluvial desert and marsh (on the S. and W.) and by mountains (on the N, and E.). Q1 ^ pluvial desert on the S. is traversed by the Karun and the 1 att el- Arab, and by far the easiest approach is from the Persian iS'k 11 . by these waterways. The Shatt el-'Arab is navigable for ocean- ■ going steamers, and can be further opened up (see Route I A in this volume), and the Karun is navigable for river steamers up to and above the Ahwaz rapids [Route II A). . The 1 ® 1 nd routes across the plains are all more or less difficult or • impassable after rain or in the flood season. Away from the rivers Isee water is very scarce in summer and autumn. Supplies are almost ■ i unobtainable except along the Shatt el-Arab in the Fellahlyeh and . Hindiyan districts, round Eam Hormuz and Behbehan, and in the plam ot Shushtar and Dizful. For land routes along the lines of the on att el- Arab, Karun, and Karun tributaries, see 1, 3, 6 a d in this volume. For routes in the plain E. of the Karun see Boutestn Persia, vol. iii, 53, 57, 61 (stages 1-3), 62, 65, 66 ; . ... tions to Boutes m Persia, vol. Hi, 72. To N. and NW. the hills of Luristan and the Pusht-i-Kuh rise in successive ranges running NW.-SE. to the high Persian plateau (the Khurramabad plain is about 3,500-4,000 ft. above Dizful). The lower ranges on the S. side of this mountain belt are chiefly sand stone and gypsum: the high ranges are separated by broad valleys or depressions filled with low sandstone and gypsum hills. The lower hills north of Shushtar and Dizful are petroliferous, and indications of oil are found here and there in the lower valleys of the Pusht-i-Kuh and in the gypsum and sandstone country between he higher ranges towards Khurramabad. The country is on the whole well watered, though in parts the supply may be poor in quality and scanty in summer. Grazing is generally good : fuel is scarce in the southern hills. Practically no supplies are obtainable. Ihe inhabitants migrate regularly between summer and winter pastures. Luristan has long been in a condition of complete anarchy, ihe easiest routes between Dizful and Khurramabad make a detour to W. None is at present suitable for wheels. See 11 a, b, c m this volume. Before the war a railway from Mohammareh to Khurramabad had been projected. It is not known whether a line across the hills had been chosen for it. A route which gives fairly easy going, and might apparently be made passable for wheels with-OIL-FIELDS Wf) 481 out difficulty, runs from Dizful to Deh Luran and Bedrah along the foot -hills of the Pusht-i-Kuh. See 10 a and b. To NE. is fche very difficult Bakhtiyari country, in which military movement on any considerable scale seems to be impossible. The main lines to Isfahan are (i) the Lynch Road vol. iii, 69, and Corrections to Boutes vol. iii (1914), 69 a): (ii) the line Shushtar—Qal'ah Bazuft—Ardal—Isfahan, shorter and possibly easier than the Lynch Road [Eoutes vol. iii, 84,82,69: Corrections, 69 a): (iii) the line Ahwaz—Ramuz—Dishmuk—Bard-i- Kirm—Lurdagan—Isfahan, through the northern part of the Kuh- galu country, believed to be easier than the Lynch Road to Gazetteer of Persia, vol. iii (1913), pp. 51-62). To E. the little-known Kuhgalu country separates the Karun plain from Shiraz (see Boutes in Persia, vol. iii, 61, and Gazetteer, vol. iii (1913), p. 51): only mule-tracks exist here. The Bushire coast-road is very hot in summer, and liable to be flooded in winter (see Boutes in Persia, vol. iii, 54, 57)._ The gypsum country in the immediate neighbourhood of Maidan-i- Naftun is rough, and becomes slippery after rain. Good water is scarce. See Eoutes in Persia, vol. iii, 74, and (1914), 71,72. The naturally fertile plain of Dizful and Shushtar, with improved irrigation and efficient government, might become a good centre for the collection of supplies. The same seems to be true of the Earn Hormuz district. The Karun country between Band-i-Qir and Mohammereh could also be restored by means of irrigation works. On mules obtainable at Dizful, Shushtar, and Ahwaz, see Appendix E. Kirkuk—Qase-i-ShIein—Mandali General This section of the oil-belt may prove very important, but it has hardly been examined as yet except in the neighbourhood of Qasr-i-Shlrln, and it is impossible to define the limits within which production on a large scale may take place. It can only be said (i) that oil is known to exist on the Turkish side of the frontier in or close to the hills near Kirkuk, Tuz Khurmatli, Kufri (Salahiyeh), and N. of Mandali: (ii) that oil is known to exist on the Persian side of the frontier in the area between-the Turkish frontier on the AV., the Mahldesht neighbourhood on the E., the Upper Sirvan (Diyaleh) on the N., and the border of Luristan on the S. In the Persian area MBS. u h h482 APPENDIX D crude oil and bitumen are found in numerous places among the lower hill ranges. Up to the outbreak of the war testing operations by Europeans had taken place in the Bajlan country (N. of Qasr-i-Shlrm) and near Qasr-i-Shlrln itself. Oil-springs are ap parently _ worked by natives in the Sharafbaiani country (N. of Bajlan), in Bajlan and round Qasr-i-Shlrln, S. of Qasr-i-Shlrln in the ranges E. of Khanikin, and elsewhere. Commercial m ^ ^ eas t up to the outbreak of war, the oil-wells on the Turkish side had not been exploited by modern methods The springs are owned, it seems, for the most part by the Turkish Government (Sultan s Civil List) and leased to contractors. The Kirkuk oil-wells were said in 1910 to be the property of Salih Pasha ot Constantinople. The oil is collected from pits in skins and carried by donkey to the refineries. There are stills at Kirkuk, 1 • an&lt; ^ ■^ anc ' a ^&gt; possibly at Kufri and Khanikin. The yield obtained in this way has been very small: thus the Kirkuk wells in 1910 were producing only about 180 gallons a day, and the prmcipal group of springs near Tuz Khurmatli (Abu Sarkhal in mu I 1^ ' Were P roducin g only about 150 gallons a day. ine refined oil seems to have been used according to its quality for illumination, lubrication, or for anointing camels against mange. In September 1916 it was reported that three stills were working at Mandali, producing a dark oil of poor quality. (6) On the Persian side, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had wells i ^ (about 14 m. NE. of Qasr-i-Shlrln), but owing to the difficulties of transport, operations on a large scale were not attempted and production was limited to the needs of the local market. The reason for keeping up this limited production was that much was hoped ot the country as a future oil-field, and it was expected that the building of the Baghdad railway and of the branch line to Khanikin would in not very many years, allow the field to be more adequately exploited : and it was judged expedient to maintain a footing here. Other springs are worked in a primitive manner by the Kurds in Sharafbaiani (e. g. Hurin), in Bajlan (at points near the Quretu), rou 1 nd Qasr-i-Shlnn, in the hills E. of Khanikin, and at Gahwarreh and Shian. (^) .may be noticed that though the economic future of this oil-area is uncertain, some experts are inclined to think that it may in the end prove more productive than the Shushtar area.OIL-FIELDS 483 Communications || It will be observed that this oil-area stretches right across the easiest line of approach from the Persian plateau to Mesopotamia. In the neighbourhood of Qasr-i-Shlrln and Zohab there is a depression in the mountain system which separates Mesopotamia from Persia. The mountains here sink to low hill-ranges and rolling plains. Through this depression runs the Baghdad—Kirmanshah road, which is already passable for wheels (see vol. iii of this Handbook, Boute 28 a: for Baghdad—Mandali, see 28 b). The northern end of the oil-area (Kirkuk—Kufri) lies along a road from Mosul, which runs under the foot of the hills, and would be fairly easy if the Great Zab were bridged, and a new bridge constructed on the Lesser Zab at Altun KOprtl: besides these bridges, only small im provements would be needed for wheels. (See vol. iii of this Handbook, Boute 25 a.) Except from Baghdad on the SW. and from Mosul on the NW., the approaches to the oil-area from the Mesopotamian side are difficult owing to lack of water and supplies. The important approaches from Persia all converge on the plain of Kirmanshah. Routes to Kirmanshah lead from Khuiramabad and Burujird {Routes 11 e and g in this volume); from Teheran and Hamadan {Routes in Persia, vol. ii, 53,71): from Bijar {Routes vol. ii, 81): from Senna {Boutes i vol. ii, 78). The country traversed by these routes is crossed from NW. to SE. by mountain ranges, between which are fertile, well-watered plains. From all the above-mentioned places roads can be found to Kirmanshah which either are already passable for wheels or could be made so without difficulty. Snow may lie on the passes in winter. Only a difficult track runs from Senna to Zohab by Juanrud, avoiding Kirmanshah. To the S. of the country between Qasr-i-Shlrln and Kirmanshah lies the difficult Pusht-i-Kuh country (see this volume, Boute 9). On the N. tracks lead to Suleimaniyeh from Qasr-i-Shlrln (see vol. iii of this Handbook, Appendix), from Kiifri (ibid., 34 a, b), and from Kirkuk (ibid.. R 37): the last-mentioned route, is just passable for wheels. The oil-bearing country itself is well-watered, has good grazing and in parts is fertile and fairly well-cultivated. The tribes of the Kirmanshah province breed mules and horses, but there seems to be no important local market. The country is fairly easy, or could be made easy, for jnovement. The chief obstacles are the larger streams (Diyaleh, Alvand, Quretu), some stony passes through the hills, and ravines in the plains. The soil of the plains becomes very sticky after rain. The main routes running through the area are the484 APPENDIX D Baghdad—Kirmanshah and Baghdad—Mosul roads mentioned above. For connexions between Mandali and Khanikin, Khanikin and Kufri, Qasr-i Shlrln and Chlah Surkh, and Qasr-i-Shlrln and Kufri, see vol. iii of this Handbook, Routes 29 32 a-b, 33, and (iii) on p. 397. T he T igris A rea General This area lies along the Tigris between the Fet-hah Gorge in the Hamrin hills, on the S., and Mosul in the N., a distance of about 100 miles as the crow flies. The places where oil is at present known to occur are all on or near the Tigris, with the exception of El-Hadhr which is near the Wadi Tartar, some 30 miles away from the river, WNW. of Qal'ah Sherghat. At present the oil in this area is worked only at Kaiyara, about 50 miles by river and 40 miles by road below Mosul. N. of Kaiyara there are oil oozings in the warm springs of Hammam Ali (15 miles S. of Mosul): to the SW. there is an oil-spring at El-Hadhr ; and at the Fet-hah Gorge, in the rocks on the left bank of the river, there are oil oozings and bitumen. It is possible that the line of the Hamrin hills to NW. and SE. of this gorge is also petroliferous. Commercial It is obvious that the economic prospects of the Tigris oil-field are quite uncertain, but a favourable opinion has been passed by one observer (Colonel Maunsell, in 1897) on the possibilities of the Fet-hah Gorge. At Kaiyara, in 1910, the bitumen was collected soft and removed in skins. The oil refinery had a primitive plant, yielding 40-50 tons of oil daily. From 20 tins of bitumen, 10 tins of oil in three qualities were obtained. In every 10 tins, two were of the first quality (colour less, but smelling strongly of some impurity, with an odour resembling that of benzine): two of the second quality (yellow): six of the third quality (black, needing to be distilled again before it would be of use for anj'thing but anointing camels against the mange). The fuel used for distillation is crude bitumen. In 1910 there was found to be about 200 tons of refined oil in store, of which over half was of the first quality. A French expert was brought from Constanti nople in Abdul Hamid's time, and some experiments (possibly borings) were made, but the yield of the springs was not increased. The springs are Government property, and are leased for exploita-OIL-FIELDS 0 485 tion. In 1908 a European firm was among the competitors for the contract, but apparently did not obtain it. In 1910 the contractor was said to be paying an annual rent of &lt;£T500 (about £450): but it was thought unlikely that the springs were yielding enough oil to give him a margin of profit, and he may have made his profit on the sale of crude bitumen. Communications There are two main approaches to this area from Baghdad : (i) By the right bank of the Tigris: the road is passable for wheels throughout, but rough in some places, and liable to be very heavy after rain: the river is best suited for JceleJcs (down-stream). Native sailing craft do not navigate above Samarra, and cannot get even so far in high flood ; steamers can navigate this part of the river only in high water, and would probably find difficulty above Samarra owing to rocks and rapids: railway from Baghdad to Samarra. (Vol. iii of this Handbook, III D, III E, 25 b. Appendix, p. 395 : the distance by river from Baghdad to Sherei- miyeh near the Fet-hah Gorge is probably about 180 m., not 150| as in Boutes III D, III E.) Practically no supplies above Samarra : good grazing in spring, fuel scarce, water from the river except on the road between Shereimiyeh and Qal'ah Sherghat. (ii) By Kufri (Salahlyeh), Kirkuk, and Altun Kopru. The road, though on the whole easy, would need improvement in places for wheels, the Great Zab would need bridging, and a new bridge over the Lesser Zab would probably have to be constructed at Altun KSprli. The route is well-watered. See vol. iii. Route 25 a. The only easy approach from Persia would be by Kirmanshah, Qasr-i-Shlrln, and Kirkuk. N. of this route there are no easy passes over the mountains. The least difficult line would perhaps be from Suj Bulaq to Rowanduz or Eaniyeh over the Garrau Shinkeh pass. (See vol. iv of this Handbook, 61 d.) For routes between Eowanduz or Eaniyeh and Urmia see vol. iv, 60 a-61 c. The route Mosul—Erbil—Altun Koprii—Eaniyeh is passable for wheels, or could easily be made so, and there is said to be now a carriage road from Eowanduz to Harir near the Great Zab (vol. iii, Route 40 and p. 278 : but later information makes this doubt ful). There is down stream Jcelek traffic on the Lesser Zab from Taktak. From the N. only difficult tracks lead through the Hakkiari country to Amadiyeh or Zakho (vol. iv of this Handbook, 62 b and following): an easier line, but one apparently not at present passable throughout for guns, is that from Bitlis to Jezlret-ibn-'Omar (vol. iv, Route 85).486 APPENDIX D From Diarbekr or the northern JezTreh, Mosul is easy of access through Nisibin, near which place meet routes from Diarbekr through Mardln, and from Ras el- c Ain on the Baghdad railway. The winter and spring route from Nisibin to Mosul leads direct across the JezTreh : in summer and autumn, owing to lack of water, a detour has to be made by JezTret-ibn- Omar and the country E. of the Tigris. The first route is passable for wheels: the second, if not so already, could easily be improved. See vol. iv, Routes 90 a—OS b. There is down-stream Ttelelt traffic on the Tigris from Diarbekr; see vol. iv, Boute III G. For communications with the Euphrates across the Jezlreh S. of the Sin jar see below, p. 488. In the oil-area itself the country on both sides of the river is open and fairly easy for movement, but on the left bank are the obstacles of the Great and Lesser Zabs, which are especially serious in the spring. There is good grazing in spring. Grain might be collected from the fertile and fairly well cultivated country between Erbil and Mosul. Water is scarce in summer away from the Tigris and its larger tributaries. In spring it is apparently to be found in numerous wadis in the JezTreh. There is water throughout the year in the Wadi Tartar, W. of Qal'ah Sherghat. T he E uphrates A rea General This petroliferous area extends along the Euphrates from a few miles S. of Hit to an undetermined point above Deir ez-Zor : there is an indication of oil on the right bank near Lubtar Island, 12 miles above Deir. (There are bitumen wells at Tel Mughaiyir south of Nasiriyeh, and near Koweit: and it has therefore been suggested that there is a continuous oil-line along the right side of the lower Euphrates valley, joining the Hit—Deir area with the petroliferous region on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. This seems to be mere conjecture.) It must be observed that the economic value of the Euphrates oil-area as a whole is quite unknown. The neighbourhood of Hit within a radius of a few miles appears to be very rich in oil and bitumen. The indications are numerous and striking, and the bitumen springs have been worked for thousands of years. On the other hand, it does not seem to be known whether the field is likely to be particularly rich in oil suitable for fuel: and it must also be remenx-OIL-FIELDS 487 bered that the continued working of the bitumen-wells for so many centuries may have exhausted a large proportion of the supply. Above Hit, the indications of oil are confined to small bituminous springs here and there (e. g. near Jibbeh, near Alus below Hadlseh, near Anah, near Lubtar Island): and in the appearance of bituminous rocks in parts of the valley (e. g. in a stretch below Meyyadln). It is quite uncertain what amount of oil may be thus indicated. Commercial E Before the war the only important exploitation of this area was to be found in the bitumen industry at Hit. There were five bitumen springs, or groups of springs, in the neighbourhood of the town; four of these were on the right bank, and one on the left. In 1909 four of them were being worked and were said to be capable of yielding between them over 2,000 donkey-loads a day: much less was actually collected. The methods of collection and preparation were primitive. The bitumen was used for pitching boats (there is a boat building industry at Hit), bridges, floors, &amp;c. Lack of transport confined the sale of bitumen to the local Mesopotamian market. The springs appear to have been the property of the Government and to have been let on lease. It has been reported that there is now (1916) a petroleum store at Hit. If this be true, it may indicate that an oil refinery has been established here. Bitumen for local consumption may have been collected near Jibbeh and Anah ? but the evidence on this point is unsatisfactory. At any rate the industry elsewhere than at Hit was quite un important. Communications The Euphrates valley obviously affords the one line of communica tion running through the area, and by reason of the deserts to E. and W. the main approaches to the area are limited to that valley. The area may be entered at its NW. or SE. end either by the river itself or by the Baghdad—Aleppo road along the right bank. The Middle Euphrates, like the Middle Tigris, is a better line of communication down-stream than up-stream. Above Hit the river can be navigated up-stream only by steamers and motor launches, and by such craft only in high water. Even then the journey would be slow and difficult in places. The Germans claim to have improved188 APPENDIX D the channel, but how far they have done so, and whether their measures are likely to benefit up-stream navigation, is not known. According to one report their improvements consist mainly in the destruction of some naurs. There is shakhtur traffic down-stream. Navigation by steamers down-stream would, under the conditions existing before the war, have been dangerous in mean water, and practically impossible in low water. The Germans besides improving the channel have established a river-port at Jerablus, and have used the river in an increasing degree for stores, munitions, and in 1916 for troops (vol. iii of this Handbook, JRoutes IV E-H). The Baghdad—Aleppo road joins the Euphrates at Fellujeh and leaves it at Meskeneh. Before the war the road was passable for wheels throughout, though unmetalled except in the stretch near Beii, and therefore rough in parts. It may have been improved since the war. There are bridges at Fellujeh and Deir and a railway- bridge above Meskeneh at Jerablus (vol. iii, for the left bank, see JRoute 47 ; for the railway-bridge, vol. iv, p. 416). On the N., the Euphrates valley can be approached from the line of the Baghdad railway by the line of the Belikh and the Khabur, which have water throughout the year. The ground in the neighbour hood of the streams, though marshy here and there, is generally open and easy (vol. iii, Boute 49 c (part), and vol. iv, 125, 132 a ? b). On the S. there is a desert route to Hit from Kerbela by the oases of Shifatheh and Eahallyeh (see Route 17 in this volume, and vol. iii, Boute 51), and another from Baghdad to Anah, very poorly supplied with water, but affording fairly good going : it has been traversed by a motor-car (vol. iii, Boute 48). N. of the line Baghdad—Pellujeh the country between the Tigris and the Euphrates is very arid, until the neighbourhood of the Sin jar hills is approached. There are also desert routes (apparently with little or no good water) between the Tigris at Samarra and Teknt and the Euphrates at Hit and Anah. Hardly anything is known of them. Farther north a number of wadis carrying water in winter and spring run down from the Sinjar into the plains. Thus the easiest line between the rivers N. of the Baghdad Fel lujeh road is that from Deir to Mosul, passing under or not far from the Sinjar hills: but this line is probably not well enough watered to be practicable for infantry in summer, and is obstructed by the obstacle of the Khabur. (See vol. iii. 49 a-d, 50.) As regards approaches from the W., the best-watered routes across the desert from Syria come in at Deir (or at Meyyadln not far below). HOIL-FIELDS 489 An ordinary caravan route before the war was Damascus—Tadmor— Deir. (See vol. iii of this Handbook, 54.) S. of this there seem to have been no routes in ordinary use in recent years, though of course lines more or less practicable exist (e. g. Abu Kemal— Tadmor: vol. iii. Route 53). The old Hit—Damascus post-route (not now in regular use) can only be traversed at speed, preferably by riding-camel, owing to lack of water (vol. iii, 52). In the petroliferous area itself there is a narrow strip of cultivation along the river-banks from Hit to Nahiyeh above Deir: little or no grain is here produced for export. From Nahiyeh to Abu Kemal both banks are almost uninhabited, and either bare or covered with tamarisk scrub. Between Abu Kemal and Deir there is almost continuous cultivation along both banks, but it extends for not more than ^ mile from the river. At present, therefore, not much in the way of supplies would be obtainable in the petroliferous country, though there is good grazing here in spring. Whether camels and horses could be obtained would depend on the attitude of the nomad tribes. fAPPENDIX E NOTE ON MULES Persian mules, as a whole, are good, though they are commonly underfed and overworked. The average load carried is 300 lb. in addition to saddle and line gear, and the average daily marching distance for ordinary caravans is 30 m. Mules are worked from the age of three or even 2| years, and do not live long ; it is rare to see a mule over fourteen years old. They should be bought at ages from three to eight years. Those of three years are the best. These mules may be divided, roughly, into four classes. (1) The Arab mule, bred from Arab mares and donkeys, is pro curable in the deserts south of the hills. This is a useful pack animal, with good girth and bone and short back; there are practically no draught animals in this class. „ (2) The pure Persian mule, bred from Persian mares and donkeys, and usually known as the Isfahan mule, is procurable north of the hills. This class is the best to be had in large numbers, and includes draught and pack animals in about equal proportions. The animals are brought across the passes as soon as routes are clear of snow, and can be purchased in normal years at Shushtar and Dizful from about March 15 onward : Shushtar would probably yield three times as many of this class as Dizful. If carrying rates from Ahwaz and Shushtar to Isfahan are high, owing to the late opening of routes and the accumulation of goods for transit, mule teers will not sell their animals readily. Ahwaz is useless as a purchasing centre, as muleteers arriving there can always get contracts for return journeys. Isfahan is the best purchasing centre, and animals should be obtainable at all times except during the ploughing and reaping seasons, December and January, April and May. (3) The Bakhtiyari mule is bred from cross-bred mares of poor type, usually half Arab, and inferior donkeys. This mule is thus a small and inferior pack animal, though usually having good bone. Animals of this type are procurable at all seasons at Dizful, and in lesser numbers at Shushtar.NOTE ON MULES 491 (4) The Pusht-i-Knh mules, commonly so called, are big-boned draught animals, of fine type, which are brought unbroken and wild to Dizful from the NW. by their Sagwand, Lur, and Kurdish breeders. They are sold to Dizful muleteers at ages from one to three years, and are prematurely broken down by overwork. These mules frequently stand 14-2 and 14-3 hands, and an animal of about 16 hands has been seen. Good arrangements for sale and purchase of these mules exist at Dizful and Shushtar, although in 191b a local boycott by certain sects caused difficulties which would not arise in normal years.PLATES I.
