Memorandum. ^ Reference your letter No.c/516-13/7, dated the 30th November 1936. 2. Your paragraph 2. It can certainly be assumed that 'aerodromes’* cover flying boat anchorages. This being so it appears to be immaterial how many aircraft alight on land and how many on water, and, as you point out, the payment of ,£150 a year for each additional service will be paid irrespective on sea of whether aircraft alight^or land. In the same way the alternative of an inclusive rental of £1000 a year covers the same contingencies. Please inform the Adviser accordingly. 3. Your paragraph 3. I concur in your views, but at this stage tSais point need not be taken up with the Adviser. 4. Your paragraph 4. The £150 is only paid for services which alight at Bahrain. This seems o^ v i° us but there is no harm in your pointing it out to the Bahrain Government. 5. With reference to paragraph 2 of Mr. Belgrave’s X , / letter enclosed by you.

I have received several reminders from the Mesopo tamia Persia Corporation, Limited, Bahrain, asking for a settlement of the matter. 2. The contentions of the Bahrain Government are:- (a) Though petrol and oil was used by Imperial Airways, it was not imported by them but was purchased locally from the firm of Yusuf Kanoo. (b) The Imperial Airways Company should not prefer a claim for a refund of imports which were imported before the Agreement was signed. 3.

As the Secretary of State for India is aware,^ steps are being taken to define the area of “ohe Civil Aerodrome at Muharraq. A map showing, in detail, the boundaries of the aerodrome will be furnished as soon as it is available. 3. In the meantime, it seems desirable that the formal consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein should be obtained to the operation of Imperial Airways’ contemplated flying- boat services via Bahrein vi/ith landings on the water near Manama. In this connection, I am to enclose a map indicating the location of the proposed flying-boat base and alighting area. 4. The use of an alighting area on the water near Manama will entail a revision of the H Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft for the Territory of Bahrein, and Conditions governing the use of the Aerodrome at Muharraq approved by His Excellency the Sheikh Hamad bin ’Isa A1 Khalifah, C.S.I., Ruler of Bahrein 5 ’ which permit of landings by aircraft at Muharraq only. The amendments necessary would seem to be as follows.- (a) Section I .- The Air Navigation Regulations for Civi l. Aircraft . (i) Paragraph 4. Delete the words ’’Aerodrome at Muharraq” and substitute the words ’’the land aerodrome at Muharraq, or the water aerodrome at Manama. 55 (ii) Paragraph 11. Delete the words 'Muharraq. Aerodrome' and substitute the words 'the Aerodromes at Mubarraq and Manama. (b) Section II - Conditions governing the us e of the. Aerodrome at Muharraq . (i) Cross heading - Delete the words ’’Aerodrome at Muharraq” and substitute the words ’’Aerodrome at Muharraq and Manama.” (ii) Paragraph 1. Delete the words ’’Muharraq Aerodrome” and substitute the words ’’The Aerodromes at Muharraq and Manama.” (c) Appendix. ’’Form of Special Authorisation for aircraft to land in Muharraq and fly over Bahrein.” (i)/ Under-Secretary of State, India Office, London, S.¥.l.(i) Cross heading - After the word 'Muharraq” insert the words u or Manama. 1 ’ (ii) Paragraph 2 (ii) - After the word ’’Muharraq” insert the words M in the case of landplanes, or the aerodrome at Manama in the case of seaplanes.' 5. I am now to ask that, subject to the concurrence of the Marquess of Zetland, the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf may be instructed to approach the Sheikh with a view to obtaining his formal consent to the operation of Imperial Airways’ flying-boat services via Bahrein, and approval of the amendment of the local Air Navigation Regulations. 6. Lord Swinton would suggest that the Marquess of Zetland may also wish to consider whether any approach to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman is desirable with reference to the proposed operation of flying-boat services over his territories with landings at Gwadar. ho amendment of^the local air navigation regulations seems to be required ii the term ’’Gwadar Aerodrome” can be interpreted as including flying boat bases as well as the land aerodrome. 7. Lord Swinton would propose that the detailed arrangements for facilities for the flying boat services at Manama and Gwadar should be left for settlement locally. He is given to understand that Imperial Airways have already made the necessary arrangements there in respect of the preliminary survey flights. I am , etc. , (Sd.)

Portions of the foreshore in that neighbourhood as well as areas in the sea adjacent to the shore are owned by private individuals. There are also fish traps in the neighbourhood which are owned by the public. If the area is (tefined and the site of the building is within it the Bahrain Government will waive the rent.

Dear Belgrave, Accommodation - BAHREIN You probably have been consulted by our representative regarding the erection of shelter which comprises Lounge, Dining Room, Lavatories, Kitchen, etd., for our passengers when they arrive and depart with the Empire Flying Boats. Would you let me know if you have approved the erection o^ this shelter, and under what conditions? We would, of course, (as has no doubt been explained to you) be prepared to lease the land, but I would appreciate it if I could have some assurance from you that we could hold it for fifteen years, say with the option of terminating the lease at the end of seven years and with the additional option of extending it for three further periods of five years. I am prepared to authorise our Persian Gulf Manager to go ahead with the erection of this structure, but I must have something authoritative from you that the lease of the necessary land can be satisfactorily negotiated.

I have discussed this matter with the Air Offi cer Gommandingj British Forces in Iraq, and later with yourself. It Is, I understand, unusual to define sea alighting areas for flying boats and no particular ob ject would be served since there can be no question of obtaining exclusive rights over a portion of the Khor Khaliyah. Moreover, were such an area to be defined it would of necessity comprise the whole sea (outside the one fathom line) b stive on Manamah and Muharraq from the Causeway between the two islands to a line running roughly north east from the Juf&amp;ir Naval Base. It is conceivable that in certain circumstances aircraft would not be able to land even in this area. Nor would such a definition serve to relieve Imperial Airways of the purely nominal rent of Rs. 25/- per annum which they propose to pay to the Bahrain Government for the site of their passenger shelter. If on the other hand it were/-) A iniiiii hKiwm-ttiiii i-yr-n • 2 - were decided to include in the sea alighting area or 'aerodrome' any part of the shallow water, it would then become necessary to buy out private rights, since existing private rights extend into the sea : and con sequently endless complications ensue, 3. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government informs me that he is no longer desirous of any definition of the sea alighting area* So far as the Royal Air Force afe concerned they own property ashore which is appa rently adequate for their needs; and as for Imperial Airways they pay merely a nominal rent of Rs* 25/— per annum for the site of a passenger shelter* In the cir cumstances, therefore, I suggest that no further action is either requisite or desirable, and that it is neces sary merely to take note of the existence oi an agree ment between the Imperial Airways and the Bahrain Admi nistration in respect of the site for the passenger shelter* U Political Agent, Bahrain.Gi3 Hon, Polli in the TheOOMTIOSHTIAL.

The Royal Air Force aerodrome is re clan :ular and approximately 1*200 yards by 1,000 yards. There is therefore no difficulty in obtaining the runs mentioned in para. 2 of your letter. The civil landing ground* however* la too small to admit of the lengths re-paired and it is doubtful ohether it would be possible to obtain the necessary extensions without a considerable amount of cutting and filling. Further* in my opinion, it would be somewhat undesirable to have two aerodromes in such close proximity.

Page.2, that Imperial Airways should pay no more for their supplies of fuel and oil than the price quoted to them, exclusive of duties,taxes and charges, by the fuel and oil suppliers, and for this reason they are of the opinion that their claim for recovery of Import Yard charges on oil is justified. A second and pertinent point to note is that the whole of the charges levied in connection with the supply of petrol are already recovered. If these taxes are levied and recovered in the one'case, they are surely equally recoverable &amp;n the other - namely In the case of oil. The Bahrain Customs have given two main reasons in support of their theory that the import Yard Bues levied by them are justified. They state first that the amount of refund allowed to Imperial Airways is calculated upon the amount of customs Duty actually suffered by the commodity at the time of its import here, which duty is calculate,, upon the value declared by the importer in support of which Is produced an official invoice of the anglo iranian Oil Co.Ltd. The second contention is that upon all imports into Bahrain there are collected, in addition to Customs Duty, certain fees known as Import Yard charges, which are roughiy equivalent to Port Trust Charges. These comprise a rental .or the packages occupying space on the Customs premises; a por erage -e removing, stowing and sorting imported packages; A pier fees, a collection for upkeep and maintenance of Customs premises. In the opinion of the Customs authorities these charges not ' Customs or other.duties and do not therefore within the scope of refund. On the other band when the agreement between His MaiestY’s Government and the Shaikh of Bahrain was originally”concluded, the clause providing for the recovery of Imoort Duty was, of course, intended to cover all duties, attendant upo? the’Import, no matter what its mature and the ultimate price to be paid oy Imperial ^ways was fixed at the quotation given them by the Oil company, had it P.T.O. are come 11Had it iDeen realised at the out-set that this Tax was to he regarded as of separate identity, and as such, irrecoverable under the terra u Import and other Duties - provision for its separate recovery might have been made in the agreement. Elsewhere Import Duty where it is recoverable, is mutually accepted as including Local Taxes of this description.

Dear Sir, I refer to our conversation of Thursday morning on the subject of the claim by the Bahrain Customs that Customs duty or at any r«te a deposit equal to this duty should be paid by Imperial Airways in respect of the two motor launches imported into Bahrain by them* To assist you to become au fait with this question I attach copies of certain letters concerning this matter of the exemption from Customs duty of equipment essential to the safe operation of Flying Boat services. I should furthermore add that on August 24 I obtained Mr.Belgrsve 1 s personal and verbal agreement that neither a duty nor a deposit should be collected by the Bahrain Customs, pending a final decision with regard to this question of the exemption from duty of all equipment essential to the safe operation of Flying Boat services. I attach also a copy of the Qustoms Director’s letter dated January 27, In which he now demands payment of duty on the two Launches. In view of the ruling of the Adviser to the B*hrain Government, it is obviously not in order, that I should pay this duty or even a deposit.

As suggested by you, I had a chat first with Mr .Tomlinson, hut he felt,,this question was now outside his province, and advised me to discuss the matter directly with Mr.Belgrave. I had an interview with Mr.Belgrave this morning, and as a result of our talk I am very glad to advise, that he is now considerably more sympathetically disposed towards our request, that a clause may he inserted in the New Civil Air Agreement which will exempt us from duty on items such as J- Inboard and outboard motor-launches and craft and their spares and accessories, mooring equipment, night landing aids (i.e. flares and electrical equipment for illuminating and dfcmarkating the alighting areas.) I think Mr.Blegrave is slowly coming round to the view r that such items as moorings and launches are after all 'essential 7 aids to the safe operation of flying Boat Services. Night landing aids he already agreed should be exempted from duty. MrBelgrave has now asked for a more detailed list of the types of equipment we may wish to import, and I should be grateful, if you could let me have this as soon as possible. Station Officer.

Copy to 5- Ground Service Manager. LondonD.O.No.C/91-13/7. The 31st January 1938. My dear Belgrave, I enclose a copy of a letter from the director of Customs to the Station Superintendent Imperial Airways, dated the 27th January 1938, claiming customs duty on two motor launches imported by Imperial Airways in connection with their flying boat service* Broad brought this letter to me as I had informed him some time ago that, in accord ance with the Civil Air Agreement, he should refer to me any differences between himself and the Customs Department. 2. I do not think that the demand is quite correct as in your letter No. 923/29 dated the 1st September informed the Political Agent that the Bahrain Government would exempt from customs duty equipment necessary for the working of flying boats* Launches are actually included in Clause 15 of the Revised Civil Air Agreement, which is supposed to be taking It retrospective effect from T &amp;nuary 1935. The Revised Agreement has, of course, not yet been signed, the delay being mainly due to the quite minor ques tion of Imperial Airways' passenger shed by the Royal Air Force pier, but I expect to hear almost any day that every one is satisfied that that question is of no importance and need not delay the signing of the Revised Agreement. When it is signed any customs duties paid by Imperial Airways on motor launches will, of course, be refunable, and there does not seem to be much object in maintaining the present demand for a duty on the two launches so far imported. 3. If you agree with this, would you kindly instruct Be Grenier accordingly and inform me?

To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. - Sir, y' 1 13 3 I have lour to refer to your printed letter No. c/78-13/7 dated 26tn January 1938 enclosing copy of a letter No. SB/2-2173 dated | 22nd January 1938 from the Station Superintendent, Imperial Airways Limited and to make the following remarks on the letter. 2. The Customs department can only refund duty which has been suffered by the commodity here and is not concerned with such price as is charged to Imperial Airways by the Anglo Iranian Gil Com- pany Limited. 3. The Bahrain Government’s interpretation of the agreement is that oil and petrol imported for use of Imperial Airways are not liable for customs duties, i.e., import duty or export duty but that they are liable to certain charges which are collected by the Customs department such as hamali (porterage), Khanchieh (storage). The statement that the whole of the charges levied -- 2 - levied in connection with supply of petrol are already recovered is not correct, I enclose a statement of the amounts claimed and paid. 4. The Bahrain Government does not have to produce 'theories* 1 in order to**justify' col lection of customs dues, the collection of duties and charges is legal and needs no justification. 5. There is no basis for assumption in the Agreement regarding exemption from duty 'was, of course, intended' to cover porterage, storage, etc.' V|A- r -wo As the new Civil Air Agreement has not yet been signed I suggest that the clause regarding exemption from customs duty should be revised and worded more clearly. It should indicate without any doubt that the exemption is on ac count of customs duties, the duty levied upon goods imported into Bahrain or exported from Bah rain, and that it does not refer to the isost of porterage or storage. Regarding the claim for refund upon Oil, I enquire whether Imperial Airways Company can explain how the Imperial Airways figure of Rs 0.103 per gallon is arrived at? There is a tU difference in the amount of about 40)6. k I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant.

Aa I have unofficial icnowledge of the views of the Bahrain Government in regard to exemption from customs and other duties, it seems desirable to refer certain points for consideration before making an official approach to Hie Highness the Shaikh in regard to a new revised draft of Jo Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement. The references below are to paragraph 3 of the Air Ministry letter of 7th March 1938 enclosed with your Express Letter under reference* n 3. Paragraph 3(b){ij* The Bahrain Government do not themselves draw a distinction between 'accessories and equipment 11 and *spare Parts' and no difficulty need be anticipated over this point* (/Signature) y ar tt c r h 3 j b) j i 1)/ S. 44. MFP—1048 S&amp;P—(M-2042)—17-12-37—20,000. (Designation)Paragraph 3(b)(ii) # The Bahrain Government, not unreasonably, draw a clear distinction between duties and taxes. They have already ex empted from customs and other duties petrol and oil etc., but they hold that under the existing Agreement they are entitled to collect the usual taxes on all articles imported into Bah- A o o rain. The revised draft Agreement, as it stands at present, contains no reference to naxes*, and since it is a commercial agreement by which Hia Majesty’s Government or their agents obtain certain facilities in exchange for a certain payment, it may be difficult to induce the Bahrain Government to add to the facilities, though not to the payment, unless adequate reasons can be suggested for so doing. The actual taxes are:- ( i) Than chi eh, 1. e. ground rent for space occupied, (ii) Porterage and (iii) pier Pees, which include a municipal tax. The rates applicable ares 12 gallon casKa of lubri cating oil . Rs. 0-4-0 Rs. 0-9-0 Rst.O — 1—6 respectively, though porterage is not at present charged on petrol and oil. A further point which causes some concern to the Bahrain Government is that petrol and oil for Imperial Airways 1 aircraft are not in fact imported by Imperial Airways or by His Majesty’s Government, but by the Anglo-Ir&amp;ni&amp;n Oil Company Limited through their local agent as a part of general con signments. Indeed some of the oil is imported from Germany and extensive Vitiations between the customs duties paid and sub 4 gallon tins of petrol ( i} Rs. 0 — 0 — 6 f ( ii) Rs. 0-0-9 I ( iii) Rs. 0 - 0 - 9 ? sequent claims received from Imperial Airways appear to indicate *hat the contract price for the oil and the value declared for cast ams/customs purposes are not the same. Difficulties of this nature are liable to impede negotiations for additional fa6ilities. Oil used in the launches is also likely to lead to diff iculty. There is undoubtedly a feeling in Bahrain that exemptions become cumulative. They begin with fuel for aircraft, extend later to fuel for launches and may in due course go on to fuel for any land transport used by Imper ial Airways, materials for buildings, supplies for personnel and so on. There is moreover the feeling that since petrol is produced in Bahrain itself it might at least be used in the launches as soon as the expiry of existing contracts permits this. unofficial views of the Bahrain Government seem to me to be not entirely unreasonable and I request instructions if the official gspgproach is to be modified in any particular.

With, regard, however, to Jihanchieh surely this is demurrage ? The ordinary practice all over the world, so far as i am aware, is for no demurrage to be charged if goods are removed immediately or within a certain prescribed period from the Customs precincts. 4. Please ascertain from belgrave if Ahanchieh is demurrage, and if not, what it is for. *ou should do this informally for the moment as the question may have wider repercussions other than merely exemption for Airways.

There is one question raised in the letter, however, which we thought might well be explored in the meantime, i.e. the use of locally produced petrol for the launches, which are the property of the Air Ministry. e have accordingly taken the matter up with Imperial Airways v/ho operate them on our behalf. According to the Company the locally produced petrol is sold in Bahrein at the same price as the motor transport petrol which comes from the Anglo Iranian Oil Company^ refinery at Ahadan; but is slightly inferior in quality. The quality of the local brand may improve as time goes on; but for the present we should prefer that it should not be used in the launches unless the suggestion is pressed on political grounds.

Area Manager, Baghdad, came to see me this morning. He said that N.A.C.S. had one or two planes at a loose end and that he has been thinking about locating one of them in Bahrain for possible services or trips between Bahrain and both Qatar and Hasa. He asked if there would be any difficulties. 2. I told Mr. Marais that so far as Qatar was concerned the only immediate prospect was for Petroleum Development (Qatar) limited to charter the machine, which could them be flown to Qatar as the Company’s own machine under the terms of their concession. For h.A.C.S* to operate a service to Qatar would involve negotiating with the Shaikh - and probably large mone tary demands from him. Mr. Marais admitted that the matter was scarcely worth pursuing at the moment since development in Qatar has been arrested by the • • •• i &gt; and that Oil Company operations there with 12 British and American personnel and one derrick offered no scope for air transport. g. As for Hasa f reminded Mr. Marais that any idea of B.A.C.S. operating a service would involve an approach to Ibn Baud through the Foreign Office. I thought that the Foreign Office would be extremely reluctant to make such an approach and that Ibn Saua would not regard it favourably. I said however that this was a matter outside my province.

Dear Joimston, II' you will be good enough to refer to the Dalnein ^ivil Aii - Agreejnent you V\?ill see that paragraph 16 provides lor the payment to the Sheihh in respect' of the lease oi the aerodrome etc# of an annual rental of £500 and a sum of £150 per annum to the Bahrein Government in respect of each additional service undertaken by Imperial Airways Ltd. In April last we made a payment for the period ending 31st December 1939 and in the absence of specific provision we calculated payment for the additional services passing through Bahrein by reference to the number of months up to that date during which the additional services were to be operated. On the outbreak of war three of the additional services were suspended but two have since been re-instated with effect from 18th October and 4thn November 1939 respectively. We are now proposing to make payment in respect of 1940, amounting to £950 on the basis of three additional services, and normally we should take steps to recover from that total a sum of approximately £75 in respect of the period during 1939 in which the additional services were suspended. We hesitate to do so, however, without being assured that at the present time there would be no undesirable political reactions. We have particularly in mind the Press reports of the generosity of the Sheikh in the way of a contribution towards the expenses of the war. Yours sincerely, (Sd. ) Y.H. Baby. H.

Colonel Fowl© and I discussed with the Medical Adviser this morning the question of quarantine in the Persian Gulf with particular reference to Sharjah. The position was explained to the Medical Adviser who agreed that provided the Government of India pass on to the Paris Office the Epidemiological Reports received by them from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and if a Resident Medical Officer is provided for Sharjah the position should be quite satisfactory. I promised that the political Department would communicate y/ith the Foreign Department of the Government of India in regard to the first point; in regard to the second point a proposal for a Resident Medical Officer at Sharjah was already under the active consideration of His Majesty^ Government. It was agreed that it would probably be a good thing to get hold of Dr.Morgan on his return from Geneva and explain the whole position informally to him in order that he might be able to pass on any necessary information informally to the Director of the Paris Office or any other member that might raise the subject. It was felt that there was no necessity for any official pronouncement on the matter.IFNOTE BY MEDICAL ADVISER, INDIA OFFICE, DATED 18th SEPTEMBER 1936. Please see attached letter from Dr.Morgan. The matter is one of considerable importance and I find myself unable to give a satisfactory reply to the letter. These towns on the Persian Gulf which till recently were remote from civilization have suddenly found themselves on a main line of air-travel. A quarantine organization suited to the new conditions is needed and I think there need be no difficulty in making a proper arrangement.. The weak point in the present scheme is Sharjah which seems to have no medical officer at all. The best means of dealing with the problem would be to ask Government of India to consult their P.H.C. as to the organization of proper quarantine supervision over the whole of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf where the working of the scheme should be placed under the supervision of the P.H.C. I do not know who is to pay for the quarantine, but the cost should be very small. India is keenly interested in these aerodromes from the point of view of the possible introduction of yellow fever by air traffic, and as the medical officers at present employed are recruited from India, there are obvious advantages in giving control to the Indian Government, I do not think we are justified in pressing Dr.Morgan to give an assurance to the Office International on the lines of the Foreign Office letter of 23rd July, 1936. Perhaps an informal conference would clear the air*L COPY OP LETTER PROM DR. MORGAN TO SIR JOHN MEGAW, DATED 14th SEPTEMBER 1936. A short time ago I got a letter (copy enclosed) from Burkett, of the Air Ministry, in reply to one I wrote to him as long ago as January 29th, in which I referred to the sanitary administration of the aerodromes situated along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf and further east, along the northern shore of Baluchistan. You will note in his letter that he took the matter up with the India Office and received from Hood, of that office, certain information regarding the posting of medical officers at the various aerodromes concerned. You will also note that as regards the establishment of an epidemiological service, the view of the India Office is that the present arrangements are working satisfactorily and that there is no necessity for international action in this respect. In this connection I would like to refer you to a letter from the Foreign Office (annexed) dated the 23rd July, 1936, addressed to this Department, in which you / will see that it is suggested, as an outcome of correspondence between the Foreign Office and the Secretary of State for India, that the Ministry of Health should give to the International Health Office the assurances referred to in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter of the 29th February, and inform the Office that the channel for communication to them of any information relating to medical conditions in the Arab States will be through the Government of India. 1/7 2'b I confess quite frankly that I am rather uneasy about the whole matter and feel personally disinclined to take tte responsibility of giving the assurances referred to above on the strength of the information that is at present in my hands. In the circumstances I should be grateful for your opinion on the matter in general and, in particular, whether on these assurances it would be possible to establish some machinery in the near future by which regular periodic communications could be made to the Paris Office concerning the epidemiological conditions in and around the aerodromes concerned, and urgent communications whenever circumstances called for them* As you know, the Paris Office meets on October 19th and this would ordinarily be the first availaole opportunity for imparting to the Office the information referred to in the Foreign Office letter of the 23rd July*!» Letter from W. Birkett* Esq.^ Air Ministry, to Dr. M.T. Morgan dated 0Oth July* 1936. Dear Morgan* As long ago as 29th January you wrote to me about the responsibility for Sanitary Administration along the Arab side ox the Persian Gulf* your enquiry being prompted by your conversation with Dr. Abt of the Office International d’Hygiene publique concerning an outbreak of smallpox at Sharjah. I took the matter up with the India Office who pursu©d it with the Political Resident at Bushire and I have now received from Hood of the India Office the following- information. ’’The sanitary administration along the Southern- shore of the Persian Gulf is supervised by officers appointed by the Government of India. The chief quarantine medical officer is the Residency Surgeon at Bushire* who has under his control an Assistant Surgeon at Bushire and Assistant Surgeons at Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat. The necessary medical and quarantine supervision at the Bahrein and. Koweit aerodromes is carried out by their respective Assistant Surgeons. At Sharjah it is carried out at present either by the Imperial Airways Station Superintendent or by the Assistant Surgeon at Bahrein. The aerodrome at Gwadur is at present under the control of the Assistant Surgeon at Muscat. The aerodromes at Sharjah and Gwadur are situated some distance from the town and they can therefore be easily isolated so that there is little danger of infection from without 11 . As regards the establishment of an Epidemiological Service/Service, the view of the India Office is that the present there i arrangements are working satisfactorily and that no necessity for international action in this respecth FOREIGN OFFICE ?

I am accordingly to suggest that the assurances in question should be communicated by the Ministry of Health to t,he International Health Office and that the latter should be informed that the channel for communication to them of any information relating to medical conditions in the Arab States will be through the Government of India.

Before leaving London I pointed out this fact to the officials of the Imperial Airways Company and they agreed that the aerodrome should be defined and shown on a map as was done in the case of the old aerodrome behind the palace in Manamah which was leased to the Royal Air Force. 3. With regard to the two proposals described in your letter, I understand that from next summer&amp; - 2 - summer the Company proposes to introduce large flying boats on the Empire Air route• These machines will alight on the water and presum ably will not use the aerodrome. Would it be possible to ascertain what services will still be carried out by land machines as this point is an important factor in deci of the two proposed methods of payment are most advantageous to the State of Bahrain/ 5 4. I am sorry that your letter has remained so long unansv\rered but it was received by me very shortly before I left England and I considered it advisable to postpone the reply until I returned. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. dSd^which Adviser to the Government.0 /3 No•C/516-13/7. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 30th November 1936.

CIVIL AIR AGRKEMEMI P BAHRiJM . UH ' I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No.873/29 dated the 3th November 1336 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, in which he enquires how many of the aircraft in the proposed services will alight on the land and how many on the water. 2. At present, there is no agreement with the Bahrain Government to allow civil flying boats to use the Khor Qalai 1 yah anchorage and I would suggest either that an addition to the proposed new civil Air Agreement is made providing for this or that it be assumed that the word aerodromes covers flying boat anchorages. The payment of £•150 a year for each additional service would then be paid irrespective of whether the aircraft alight on sea or land* 3. If Imperial Airways require facilities in addition to the right to alight at Khor Qalai 1 yah, for example sites for buildings or piers, such proposals would require consideration on their merits, and it is also possible that these large flying boats which require considerable space in which to manoeuvre2 © '4 manoeuvre may cause damage to fish trap rights, in which case compensation may have to be paid* 4» In the future It may happen that some of the services may pass over Bahrain but not alight there* In such cases ' i * * I presume that the extra £.150 a service would not be paid, but the position should, I think, in fairness be made clear (so far as it may be possible to foresee it ) to the Bahrain Government to help them in making their choice of the form of payment i*e* a lump sum of £.1,000 or £.500 plus £.150 for each service* I have the honour to be.
