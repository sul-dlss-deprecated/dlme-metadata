It v/ill be seen from memo. 'o. 223 dated 6th February 1919, from the 1st assistant He si dent, Bushire, to the Political ..gent, Bahrain (extract enclosed) that this exchange com pensation allowance has been sanctioned at the rate of 75 per c«nt on salary with effect from 1st October 1918 a 1 ^ is hpi'pg r^n^wod every 3 months. The Postmaster- gon^ral, Bombay, to whom the matter was referred by the Assistant Director, Postal Services, Bushire, recommends that a dollar exchange compensation allowance should be granted to the oostal staff at Bahrain on the same grounds upon which it was sanctioned by Government for all officials of other Departments at that place. ..he Accountant-General, Posts and Telegraphs, who was con sulted in the matter un-officially is, however, of opinion (cony enclosed) that the specific sanction of the Government of india to the grant of this allowance to postal officials should be Obtained. i beg accordingly that Government may be pleased to admit the postal establishment at Bahrain to the &gt;nefits of the Dollar exchange connensation lov/ance itlwitn effect from thn 1st Cctober 1018 n o pi °^itions as those applicable to in civil employ at that station. on the same rate other officials I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

Sir, We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with our despatch No. 43 (Establishment), dated the 14th May 1919, regarding the grant of exchange concessions for Government employes at Bahrain. 2. We now enclose a copy of a letter from the Deputy Political Resident, Bushire, recommending that the concession sanctioned may have effect, if not from the 15th February 1918, at least from the 1st April 1918. We would explain, in this connection, that our reason for suggesting the 1st October 1918. as the date from which the concessions in question should be sanctioned was that it was only then that the question came before us. We agree, however, with Mr. Bill that existing orders place Government servants at Bahrain at a disadvantage as compared with establishments at Maskat, and we therefore now propose that the exchange compensation should be granted for Bahrain with effect from the 1st April 1918. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, ^ —r-rv^- J\ Ct- 3l JULigjgNo. 030, dated Bushire, the 19th April 1919. 3ist Elt^'mr i\w‘£ £Z5T‘£!oTZf°„?■ a ‘ M Bahrain I was approached by the Government 0 i! n i„ - ^ on a . recent Vls *t to ful petition that the orders tLreb conveved mFi^ K ^ 16 -^* a , res P ect - from which effect was to be given to them antedated if notTo Sbr^rtVsth 1918 as recommended in my telegram No. 1727 of 18th December 1918 at least to the beginning of the last financial year.

The present orders inflict upon them a great hardship compared to the holdere of similar posts in Muscat. In view of the great difficulty of recruiting clerks for the Gulf a subject upon which I hope to address you as soon as the future status of Mesopotamia is finally decided, I feel sure that Government would be well advised to grant this small concession.1919.
