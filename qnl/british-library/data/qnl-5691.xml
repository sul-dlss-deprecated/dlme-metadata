IN continuation of our letter, dated the 28th October, 1875, we have the honour to forward copy of letters, relative to the jurisdiction which may be exercised by British authorities in Persia. 2. We are clearly of opinion that in a suit between two British subjects either Mr. Taylour Thomson or Lieutenant-Colonel Ross would have been justified in asserting his jurisdiction ; the former under Article IX of the Treaty of Paris which gives us the same privileges as the Russians enjoy under Article VII of the Commercial Treaty of Turkomauchai; and the latter under the usage which prevails on the littoral of the Persian Gulf, and which we are prepared to maintain for the reasons given in paragraph 7 of our despatch of the 24th January, 1873.* We have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. W. NORMAN. ARTHUR HOBHOUSB. E. C. BAYLEY. W. MUIR. A. J. ARBUTflNOT. A. CLARKE. Inclosure 2 in No. 5. Mr. Thomson to the Earl of Derby. Gulahelc, August 26, 1875, IN the spring of 1873 I was informed by Her Majesty's Resident at Bushire that a British Hindoo merchant, named Moolchund, residing at Bunder Abbass, in the Persian Gulf, had complained to him that his partner, another British Hindoo merchant, named Morwarud, residing at &gt; Kennan, had turned Mohamedan, with the intention of appropriating a large sum of mone}', being the value of goods which had been entrusted to the plaintiff for sale by a British Hindoo merchant at Shikarpoor. I brought the matter to the notice of the ex-Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and on the 23rd of June of the same year informed Colonel Ross that his Excellency had instructed the Governor of Kerman to investigate the claims of British Indian subjects against Morwarud and to bring them to a settlement. Those instructions were not, however, satisfactorily attended to. It appears that by means of douceurs which he gave to the Kerman authorities, and having, moreover, secured the sympathy of the Mohamedan inhabitants of Kerman, through his conversion, the defaulter has hitherto succeeded in evading the attempts which have been made to bring him to justice. Fresh applications were from time to time addressed to me by the injured parties; fresh representations made by me to the Persian Government, and fresh instructions sent by them to the Governor of Kerman, but without any satisfactory result. Morwarud was several months ago ordered to come to Teheran ; but as the matter could not be investigated here, I suggested that he should be sent back to Kerman, where the necessary witnesses and accounts could be examined, no interpreter or person competent to read the character in which those accounts were kept being available here. A meeting of Hindoo and Mohamedan merchants was subsequently held at Kerman, and a decision, sealed by Mohamedans only, however, was given to the effect that Morwarud was liable for a small portion of the claim against him. One of the plaintiffs partners arrived here lately, and requested that I would cause the defaulter to proceed to Bunder Abbass, and that their accounts should be formally examined there and brought to a settlement. I again communicated with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject, and his Highness on the 19th instant addressed an instruction to the Governor of Kerman, which has been sent to me for transmission. According to this letter the Governor of Kerman is directed to send Morwarud, now known by the Mohamedan name of Alee Akbar, to Bunder Abbass, to undergo an * See previous papers, page I. [399] Bexamination of his accounts at a meeting to be held by Hindoo residents there and others* with the knowledge of the Persian Agent for Foreign Affairs. The matter should then be brought to a final settlement and reported to the Persian Government. If' Morwarud was a Persian subject, this mode of procedure would seem to be perfectly regular. But he is a British subject accused of defrauding other British subjects. According to the \ Ilth Article of ttys Commercial Treaty of Turkomanchai between Russia and Persia, and to the Treaty of Paris between England and Persia, which latter confers on us the privileges of the most favoured nation, the investigation and settlement of a case of this nature would be entirely confined to the Representative or Consul of Her Majesty the Queen, and decided according to British law. But Her Majesty's Minister and Consuls in Persia are not invested with judicial power; and if the exercise of such power by Persian authorities over British subjects were once recognized, it might later be cited as a precedent, if not interpreted as a surrender by us of an important Treaty right. This argument might be overcome with reference to Kerman on the ground that, as no British Consul or Agent resides there, the local authorities acted under a special request, of the British Mission; but Bunder Abbass lies within the so-called jurisdiction of Her Majesty's Resident at Bushire. It would, therefore, appear to be very objectionable to permit a suit such as the present one to be adjudicated in that quarter excepting by a British authority. It struck me that the Resident at Bushire might possibly be invested with judicial power by the Government of India, in which case I should have called upon the Persian Government to send Morwarud to Bunder Abbass, to be there tried by the Resident or his representative. 1 accordingly asked Colonel Ross, by telegraph, whether he possessed the requisite legal authority • but he sent me the reply, ' I have not leeallv jurisdiction.' I now feel convinced that any further investigation of this case by the local authorities of Kerman would be unadvisable, and that my best course would be to suspend further action in the matter pending the receipt of your Lordship's instruc tions. I shall, therefore, inform the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is my intention to withhold his letter to the Governor of Kerman until 1 receive your Lordship's instructions. Inclosure 3 in No. 5. Mr. Henvey to Lieutenant-Colonel Ross. Fort William, November 29, 1875. I AM directed to forward copy of a letter from Her Majesty's Minister in Persia to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs dated the 26th August, 1875, relative to a claim preferred by a British Hindoo merchant, residing at Bunder Abbass, against another British Hindoo merchant, residing at Kerman, who was supposed to have adopted the Mohamedan religion with the view of defrauding his creditors. 2. With reference to your telegraphic intimation to Mr. Taylour Thomson that you had not ' legally jurisdiction,' I am directed to inquire whether the course taken by v T ou rests on the ground formally assigned by Colonel Pelly in his letters marginally noted* for doubting the legality of his jurisdiction. If so, 1 am directed to refer you to this Office letter dated the 20th September, 1873, in which you were informed that, as there was reason to believe Colonel Pelly was mistaken in his views as to the irregularity of the present practice referred to, no change whatever should be made pending further instruc tions.' Although these orders were issued principally with the view of providing for claims and disputes arising between British and Persian subjects, it is obvious that they apply with still greater force to cases in which both parties are British subjects. 3. I am also to request that you will furnish the Government of India at your earliest convenience with a tabulated statement showing the number, description, and value of all cases, civil and criminal, adjudicated by you and your Assistants during the three years ending 31st December, 1875, discriminating between the various jurisdictions in the manner shown by Colonel Pelly in his letter of the 22nd October, 1870. • To Bombay Governraent, October 22, 1870. To Bombay Government, September 19, 1872.Inclosure 4 in No. 5. The Governor^General of India in Council to the Marquis of Salisbury. My Lord Marquis, Simla, October 28, 1^75. WE have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's despatch dated the 18th February, 1875, transmitting copy of correspondence which has passed between the Indian and Foreign Departments of Her Majesty's Government on the subject of Mr Reilly's recommendations with respect to the passing of an Order in Council to apply the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to Persia, and requesting that the views of the Government of India may be communicated on Mr. Reilly's Memorandum. 'J. Hie following is a summary of the chief recommendations submitted bv Mr. Reilly:— (1). That a uniform system or combined systems of judicature for the whole of Persia shouui be established by Order in Council, with adaptation to the different circumstances of the interior and the littoral: (2). That the officers exercising the jurisdiction should not necessarily be Consuls : (3). That in purely British suits there should be an appeal in Persia: (4). 1 hat in purely British suits there should be a final appeal (in proper cases) to the High Court of Bombay: (5). That in mixed suits, with Persian plaintiffs and British defendants, the British Court should have exclusive jurisdiction in the first instance : ((i). That in mixed suits, with British plaintiffs and Persian defendants, mixed Courts should have jurisdiction in the first instance, but with liberty for a Persian defendant to submit to a British Court: (7). That for both these classes of mixed suits there should be a mixed Court of Appeal in Persia: (8). That British Indian law, civil and criminal, should be applied throughout: (9). That any Order in Council should, as regards Persia, be based on a separate and express Convention: (10). That like provisions, with proper variations, should be applied to the Arab States by Order in Council on the basis of sufferance and usage. 3. We have carefully considered these proposals and generally assent to them, subject to some modifications in detail as suggested below. 4. The first question w 7 hich would appear to call for settlement is whether the proposed Order in Council should be based on our present Treaty with Persia, and the present usage which prevails in that country, or whether it should be preceded by the conclusion of a new Convention in which our jurisdiction shall be clearly set forth, and provision made for the establishment of mixed tribunals. On this question we think that a new Convention would be advantageous, if a proper one can be obtained. 5. In our despatch dated the 10th January, 1873, we strongly urged the conclusion of a Commercial Treaty with Persia. We are of opinion that due provisions for establishing our jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters on a sound basis and for the establishment of of mixed tribunals might conveniently form a part of it. It would of course be necessary that in opening negotiations great caution should be exercised in order to prevent the possibility of any doubt being thrown upon the usage under which we now enjoy jurisdic tion on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf. 6. With regard to the particular privileges to be stipulated for in the proposed Con vention, we think there is little to be added to the suggestions contained in paragraphs 31 and 42 of Mr. Reilly's Memorandum. But there is one point of some importance which should, in our opinion, be provided for in framing the Convention. We think that there should be an express provision for placing the subjects of Princes and States of India in alliance with Her Majesty, and other persons who are entitled to British protection, on exactly the same footing, with respect to their privileges and their liabilities, as the natural-born subjects of Her Majesty. We do not anticipate that any difficulty will be made in conceding this principle, as by usage we have for many years past exercised jurisdiction over this class of persons in the Persian Gulf. A separate instrument has lately been executed at Muscat by which the Sultan has acknowledged our rights in this respect. It would be convenient to establish some machinery by which persons of this class could be identified as belonging to the class, and the Convention might, provide that the fact of an Indians name (whether he is a subject of the British Crown or of a Native Prince or State) being inserted in the registered lists, which should be kept by the Persian Authorities, as well as at the British Consulate, shall be taken to be sufficient evidence of the man's legal position, and shall be binding on all parties. It might also be consideredwhether a division into two clases would not be desirable in Persia as in Fur key. * 1 should also be noticed that at present our Authorities exercise jurisdiction in cases where the plaintiffis British and the defendant neither British nor Persian, if the deiendant con sents. This is a class of suit not specifically mentioned in Mr. Reilly's classification. It would doubtless fall under his head No. 6, if that were agreed on. 7. Should Her Majesty's Government deem it inadvisable to open negotiations for a Convention, or to give an opening for the usage on which we now exercise our jurisdiction to be called in question, we think, with great deference to the opinions which have been expressed to the contrary, that there is ground for resting the proposed Order in Cotmcil on the existing Treaty and on usage as suggested by us in our letter datea the 24tli January, 1873. 8. Our reasons for thinking we are justified in basing our claims to jurisdiction upon usage will be found in a Minute drawn up at our request by our honourable colleague Mr. Hobhouse, and herewith forwarded. It is to be observed that the question is of con siderable importance as regards both the legality ot past proceedings and Uie instructions to be given to our officers pending the interval, which may be a long one, between the present moment and the settlement of a new Convention. In our letter ot / th January, 1873, paragraph 7, we stated our opinion that the present course of practice should be continued ; and we purpose to continue it unless we receive orders to the contrary. 9. The proposed Order in Council will comprehend the provisions necessary for the establishment of a system of law and ot judicial tribunals in cases where omy initish subjects are Concerned, in which they are defendants, or in which foreigners (not Persians) who consent to our jurisdiction are defendants. We so far concur with Mr, Reilly as to think that the substantive civil and criminal law to be administered in these cases should as a rule be the civil and criminal law in force for the time being in British India. But as regards criminal law, an absolute provision to that effect seems to us undesirable. We should prefer to invest the principal Judge with the power ot making regulations, as advised by paragraph 13 of our letter of the 24th January, 1873.t These regulations should not have legal effect until they had received the confirmation of the (Government of India, which should be the principal controlling authority under the Order in C ouncil in judicial matters. 10. Should an appellate tribunal be established, it should be considered to what extent the jurisdiction should be enlarged. Clearly many criminal cases ought to be decided locally which it is now necessary to send to Bombay, fhe dillicuUy ot ptoducmg the requisite evidence at the right time renders the original criminal jurisdictioii ot the Bombay Court very liable to failure, as some recent cases have taught us. In civil cases we are of opinion that the right of second appeal should be carefully guarded both by a limit of value and also by the provision that the question involved should not be one of fact only, at all events when the lower Courts are agreed. It is difticuit at present lo say what the limit of value should be: it must necessarily depend on the value to which suits commonly range—a point on which we are not yet informed. ^ ith respect to the locality of the first Appellate Court, it might be directed to sit at Bushire, or any other convenient place in Persia. The Order in Council might leave a discretion on this point to the Government of India. 11. We think that the British Courts should have power to remit to the tribunals ol the country the cognizance of criminal cases when they think justice will be better done thereby. • , , ... „ 12. We do not think it necessary to enter on the question that has been incidentally raised regarding Bassidore and Angaum {Henjam). These are Persian territory, and there is no need to mention these specially in the Order in Council more than any other portion of Persian territory. 13. Should the Convention be concluded, it is clear that the original suggestion that there should be one system for the whole of the Persian Gulf must be modified. A separate system already exists for Turkish Arabia, and the jurisdiction ot the Consular Officers is defined and regulated by the Ottoman Order in Council of the 12th Decemberj 1873. If a local Appellate Court were eventually established for Persia, it might probably be convenient to alter the system now in force in Turkish Arabia, and to bring it into conformity with the system to be established in Persia and with an appeal to the same local Appellate Court'and to Bombay. But at present any discussion of this question would be premature. . 14. It would also be impracticable to include Muscat in the Order in Council to be framed for Persia under the Convention, and a separate Order in Council would be neces- ♦ See our despatch dated October 28, 1875. t See previous papers, page 3.sary. The arrangements made under the new Order in Council for Muscat would however, be substantially the same as in the Order applicable to Persia, and the .Muscat Order would further provide for the Vice-Admiralty Jurisdiction of the Consul at Muscat (which has lately been extended by the ie East African Courts Act, 187'3 '). 15. The Order in Council for the petty Arab States on the shores of the Persian Gulf should, as Mr. Reilly points out, be based on usage and sufferance. It would probably be practicable to couch this Order in a simpler form, and to leave greater latitude to the Judicial or Consular Officers in administering it, but the main principles should be the same as those which would govern the proposed Order in Council for Persia. 16. x\s regards the form to be adopted in framing these Orders, we concur with Mr. Reilly in thinking that the Ottoman Order of the 12th December, 1873, should, as far as the varying circumstances of the case admit, be taken as the model. We trust that before the Draft Convention is submitted to the Persian Government we may be favoured with an opportunity of seeing it, and that a copy of the Dralt Order in Council may also be forwarded to us before it is issued. We have, &amp;c. (Signed) H. W. NORMAN. NAPIER OF MAGDALA. A. HOBHOUSE. W. MUIR. A. J. ARBUTHNOT. A. CLARKE. Inclosure 5 in No. 5. Minute by Mr. Mohhouse on the Civil Jurisdiction exercised by the British Government on the Persian Seaboard. 1. IT is of considerable importance to know the actual basis on which this jurisdic tion rests. As regards the past we might, perhaps, be content with the probability that Acts once accomplished will not be called in question, and ii a new C onvention were concluded, or were on the eve of conclusion, the true foundation of our jurisdiction would be matter rather of speculative than practical interest. But nobody can tell whether any new Convention will be brought about, or when it will be settled, or what shape it will assume. In the meantime our officers must discharge the duties which their position throws upon them. They cannot disclaim the jurisdiction hitherto exeici^ed, nor is it desirable that their hands should be enteebled by doubts ot its validity. Moreover, we have to negotiate with the Persians, and we may weaken our position if we abandon a piece of firm standing ground. ? 2. The cases in which jurisdiction is exercised, and has been so tor a long while, are stated in the 6th paragraph of our despatch of 24th January, 1873.* A substantial deduction from the practical value of the jurisdiction to the parties concerned must be made on consideration of the circumstances stated in Colonel PeUy's report ot 22nd December, 1870, and in Mr. Taylour Thomson's despatch of 31st December, 1873.t The latter document is, of course, new to the Government of India, and the former appears not to have been in our hands when the despatch of 24th January, 18/3, was penned. Indeed, it has only now been procured from Bombay, because finding it mentioned in one of the papers, I thought it might throw light on the point referred tor my con sideration. . , T&gt; ■ 1 | « 3. From Colonel Pelly's Report I collect that, although the British authority may make a decree, yet inasmuch as that decree must be executed by Persian authorities, the defendant may raise difficulties, and then the case becomes the subject o( negotiation between British and Persian Ministers. From Mr. Taylour Thomson's despatch it appears that, in spite of the Treaty of Turkomanchai, disputes between Persians and Russians are, according to present practice, settled in much the same way as disputes between I ersian and British subjects have been for a great many years. I do not collect from either document whether the disputes which arise after decree arise equally in all cases, or mainly in those cases in which Persians are defendants. . 4 I am afraid that in all countries there is a practical difierence between getting a decree and getting the fruits of it. There is such even in England ; there is much more in India, and probably more still in Persia, at least where the dispute is between a toreign jilaintiff and a native defendant. That is a reason why we should endeavour to make some • See previous papers, page 2. t Ibid,, page 80. [399] U8 arrangement with the Persians binding their authorities to give effect to the decrees made in the cases decided by British authorities; but it hardly affects the abstract question of jurisdiction. I do not find it anywhere slated that a Persian can, or ever does, sue a British subject before the Hakim, as he can clearly sue a Russian subject according to the Treaty of Turkomanchai. On the contrary, he sues before the British judge, and the decree then obtained is either obeyed, or at least forms the basis of negotiation between the authorities of the two countries. 5. It seems clear, then, that we have a privilege, as to the substantial value of which every one who speaks of it is agreed, viz., that our subjects shall be sued before our authorities, and not before a Persian tribunal. This privilege is, as I think, contravened by no Treaty whatever. The Russians also appear practically to use the same privilege, but it is in the teeth of their Treaty. On the advantages of the former position I need not dilate. 6. In one or two of his letters Colonel Pelly intimates an opinion that, since the Persian war, the practice of our officers has been and is now unauthorized and irregular. We, on the other hand, bold that the practice is legal, and should be continued until altered by Order in Council. We have expressed that opinion in our despatch of the 24th January, 1873, and have directed our officers accordingly. It now appears that our opinion is at variance with some opinions given to the Foreign Office in England. 1 venture, however, to think that it is a sound one for the reasons i am about to assign. 7. In paragraph 2 of th_eir joint report Sir Philip Francis and Sir Arnold Kemball, without discussing the question, lay down that, ' so far as Treaties are concerned, Articles IX and XII of the I reaty ot Paris limit Her Majesty's powers of jurisdiction in Persia to the extent to which they may be accorded to the most favoured nation, and these are to be found specially defined by Articles VII and VIII of the Treaty of Turkomanchai.' From paragraph 3 of the same Report, and from the subsequent letter of Sir A. Kemball, dated the 16th March, 1874, 1 collect that these gentlemen consider that, besides what is secured by Treaty, there may be jurisdiction resting on sufferance and usage, and that they attach importance to the point. r .l he opinion of Mr. Thomson, expressed in his letter of 31st December, 1873, is to much the same effect, only that he states less positively and more accurately the relation which the Treaty of Turkomanchai bears to the Treaty of Paris. 8. So far the opinions given are consistent with the only position we care particular!} to defend, and other points of difference might be left unnoticed. But Mr. Reiilv's opinion cuts much deeper. His two main propositions are: 1st, that Article IX of the Treaty of Paris (the nxost-favoured-nation clause) abrogates ail our rights which rest on sufferance and usage; V^ndly, that the same Article, by its own force and without any further act, ascertains the jurisdiction of British Consuls and the legal status of British subjects. See for the first proposition paragraph 4, and for the second paragraphs 23 eC seo. of his Memorandum. 9. The reason assigned by Mr. Reilly is that our arrangements with the Persians were interrupted by a war; that the war was terminated by a Treaty; that the Treaty contains a specific stipulation on the subject under consideration ; and that, therefore, it is at least not safe to take anything but the Treaty as the foundation of our jurisdiction. He speaks with due cautions and qualifications as becomes a prudent lawyer. He calls attention to the circumstance that he had not seen our despatch; from which I presume he had not seen the papers we transmitted, which show how long we have exercised definite kinds of jurisdiction without intermission. And his only absolute conclusion is that, 'for the present purpose at any rate, the Treaty may be taken as the foundation of the jurisdiction, or at least as supplying the only, or the best available, test of its nature and scope.' Of course, the point of most immediate importance to us—the position of our officers was not under discussion, and was no part of Mr. Reiily's present purpose.' But negotiation with the Persians was a part of that purpose; and even as regards that, it seems to me that we place ourselves in a distinctly inferior position if we allow that we can claim nothing except through the sides of another party and because that other has got it, instead of standing on what we actually do, and have done before the Russian or German Treaties existed. 10. 1 take Mr. Reiily's second proposition, which is the fair and legitimate sequence of his first one, and ask what are its practical consequences. If it prevails, no Consular Court could ever know what its jurisdiction is, and no suitor could ever be certain of his rights. Let us assume that Russia is the most favoured nation, as Mr. Thomson says he conceives that it is ' at present ' Then we are to read into the Treaty of Paris the provi sions of the Treaty of Turkomanchai, and thus to make the Treaty of Paris say that British Consuls and subjects are to be in the same legal position as Russian Consuls andsubjects are under the Treaty of Turkomanchai. On this footing, an Englishman institutes a suit and prosecutes it before the British Consul. Pending the suit, war breaks out between the Russians and the Persians. War abrogates all Treaties; and so away flies the Treaty of Turkomanchai, and with it the basis on which our Consul and the suitors of his Court have been proceeding. 11. But, in truth, the assumption that the Russians are the most favoured nation is by no means a safe one. Or, if it could be upheld now, it may not be tenable next year. A Treaty may be made with some other nation which would clearly place it in the position of the most favoured nation, and which yet may lay down the lines of Consular jurisdiction in a way very different from, and very embarrassing to, all our existing arrangements. Or a Treaty may be made with another nation which would place it as regards some provisions in a more favourable position, and, as regards others, in a less favourable position, than the Russians; and this, it would seem is actually the case with the German Treaty. Or there may be provisions in the German Treaty which the Germans consider more favourable to them than corresponding provisions in a Russian Treaty, while the opinion of the Russians is just the reverse. Or a Treaty with Germans may, as regards the kind of jurisdiction conceded, be more favourable than the Russian Treaty is to them ; but the former may be, as the German Treaty is, determinable on notice, or limited to a short term of years, and the latter permanent. W hich, then, is the most favoured nation, and by what standard shall the jurisdiction of our Consular Courts be regulated? 12. According to Mr. Reilly's view, any or every of the questions here suggested may have to be decided in our Consular Courts and by Persian authorities too, before the Consular jurisdiction can be ascertained ; every year may bring with it some new question, and every suit may undergo unforseen vicissitudes. It would be perfectly competent for a person sued before our Consul, on the ground that he has the same jurisdiction as the Russian Consul, to deny his jurisdiction and to say that he has only the same jurisdiction with the German or the French Consuls. Upon which our Consul would have to compare and weigh the rival Treaties one against the other, to look at each from its own national point of view, and to determine which of them taken as a whole confers the greatest amount of political advantage on the nation which holds it. Supposing this hopeful question to be decided in favour of our Consul's jurisdiction and a decree to be passed, that decree has to be enforced in Persia; and then it is open to the Persian authorities to say that our Consul was entirely mistaken as to the nation which is most favoured, and that he had not the jurisdiction he supposed. It seems to me that on such principles the proverbially glorious uncertainty of law will reach a pitch of glory hitherto unexampled. 13. I could pursue the difficulties arising from the construction placed upon the Treaty of Paris into further ramification of detail. But it is sufficient here to give the broad outlines of them. If they are not sufficient to instil doubts about the correctness of the construction, neither will greater fulness of detail do so. 14. But 1 ask what rational people could ever have intended to place themselves in such a position. Is it possible that either we or the Persians could have intended to base important arrangements on such a shifting and treacherous quicksand? Is ibpossible that any one can have intended that arrangements involving the legal rights of a considerable class of persons should be varied or nullified without our knowledge or even against our will, by the accident of war, or by the conclusion of a Treaty with some one else who is looking to his own interests and not to ours ? Such conclusions could only be forced upon us by the clearest, most stringent, and most intractable expressions. It would be justifiable to put even a great strain upon the ordinary meaning of language in order to escape from them. 15. To my understanding no strain whatever is required to bring a perfectly sensible and rational construction out of the Treaty. On the contrary, I think that it is straining the language, and straining it much, to say that by its own force and without more it imports into the Treaty of Paris the provisions of the Treaty of Turkomanchai or of any other Treaty whatever. The plain and simple meaning of the words seem to me to be this : that in the specified particulars of the right to be placed on the footing of the most favoured nation is reserved to us ; or in other words, if another nation receives a privilege which we have not, we shall have a right to claim it. 16. The statements in the joint report and in Mr. Thomson's letter which speak of the limit imposed by Treaty upon the jurisdiction are correct in the sense, which seems to be the sense intended, that, looking to Treaties alone, no other jurisdiction is conferred. But the Treaty of Paris does not purport to impose any positive limit on what may have an independent existence. There is nothing in Article IX to support such a convention. The language of Article XII is destructive of it There 'The British Government requires, and the Persian Government engages, that the same privileges shall inPersia be conferred upon . . British . . subjects ... as are conferred upon . . . the most -favoured foreign Government, its servants and its subjects ' Fhis is not language adapted to impose a limit on the claims of Great Britain. Nor is it intended to thrust down our throats something which others may consider a privilege but which we do not value. It is clearly addressed to the enlargement of our privileges whenever we find that another nation has got what we have not got, and what we may wish to have. 1 think that the reasonable and natural construction of Article IX is the same. 17. I do not mean to say that if we were to find the Russian or German Consuls clearly exercising a jurisdiction which we desired to have, it would be necessary to make a formal arrangement with the Persians before we could do so. In such a case it would probably be sufficient to assume the jurisdiction, and in case of objection to point to the acts ol the other nation as our justification. What I am contending is that the terms of the Treaty of Paris do not force upon us what we may not want, or deprive us of our right to claim privileges under another title. 18. Then, is it reasonable to set up sufferance and usage as the title by which we claim civil jurisdiction on the Persian seaboard ? Now, that usage has prevailed for fully half a century up to the present time. It may indeed be said that the sulferance of that usage by the Persians was broken during the war. But seeing that the usage since the war has been precisely the same as the usage prior to the war, it must be taken that the suffer ance of it was revived on the conclusion of peace, and that we were thereby replaced in our old position. If indeed there were, as Mr. Reilly suggests, a specific stipulation in the Treaty of Paris on this subject, it might be that the usage could not prevail against it. But 1 have already referred to the terms of the Treaty. Anything more vague and unspecific than the stipulation can hardly be imagined. It refers to no document, to no arrangement, and to no persons, as a standard the examination of which will show what are the rights of British subjects in Persia. It does not say what nation is the most favoured, but leaves that to be ascertained by inquiry and comparison. In truth, the moment we try to make it specific it launches us, as above shown, on a sea of troubles. Such a stipulation as this cannot be set up against usage that began before it, and con tinued through its generation and after its birth. In such a case as this, usage is the solid, substantial and specific thing, and the Treaty a mere generality, affording ground tor claiming some privilege in future, but actually operating nothing till followed up by overt acts. 19. Suppose that all the Treaties of the Persians with other nations were abrogated by war or otherwise. Should we allow' the contention that our Consul s jurisdiction was abrogated too, and that the privileges of our subjects were gone until it pleased the Persians to make a new Treaty w 7 ith us ? 1 conceive that we should insist on exercising the rights we had been accustomed to exercise, and that we should take one of two views. Either we should say that terms of so extremely vague a nature must be interpreted by the acts of the parties, and that even a very short period oi recognized usage was suflicient to show w T hat was understood by them. Or we should say that such a Treaty merely gives to one party the right of claiming from the other concessions made to another nation. J. he latter is the true view, I think. 20. The foregoing are the main reasons why I think that we may rightfully insist and ought to insist upon existing sufferance and usage both in negotiations with the Persian Government, and in the conduct of business, till such negotiations are completed.

BEFORE replying to your despatch No, 132 of the 26th of August last, in which you refjuested instructions respecting a suit between two British subjects named Mool- chund and Morwarud, residing respectively at Bunder Abbass and Kerman, I thought it right to consult Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India in Council, especially with reference to that part of your despatch in which you report that the British Resident at Bushire had informed you that he ' had not legally jurisdiction' in a case of this nature. A reply to my communication having been received from the India Office, 1 have now11 to state to you that the Governmeut of India, to whom the matter was referred, are of opunoii that in a suit between two British subjects, either you or the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, would have been justified in asserting your jurisdiction; that you were entitled to do so under Article IX of the Treaty of Paris which gives to Great Britain the same privileges as are granted to Russia under Article VII of the Commercial Treaty of i urkomanchi, and Colonel Ross under the usage which prevails on the littoral of the Persian Gulf, Taking, however, into consideration the difficulty of dealing with this case at Tehran, as reported by you, and having regard to the fact that Bunder Abbass lies within the jurisdiction of Her Majesty's Resident at Bushire, it would appear that that officer is the proper authority to hear and decide the present suit. I have, therefore, to request that you will refer the matter to Colonel Ross, to whom t.ie '•vernment of India have addressed a despatch, copy of which is transmitted herewith tor your information.* I am, &amp;c.

I HA\ E the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Under-Secretary to the Government's letter, dated 29th November, 1875, forwarding a copy of a letter dated 26th August, 1875, from Her Majesty's Minister in Persia to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and inquiring whether my reply to his Excellency to the effect that I had not legal jurisdiction rested on the ground assigned by Colonel Pelly in his letters to the Government of Bombay, of 22nd October, 1870, and of 19th September, 1872, for doubting the legality of his jurisdiction, and if so directing my attention to your letter of 20th September, 1873, in which I was informed that, as there was 'reason to believe * Inclosure 3 in No. 5 [399| f Inclosure I in No. 5. DColonel Pelly was mistaken in his views as to the irregularity of the present practice referred to, no change whatever should be made pending further instructions. 2. I respectfully beg to explain that my reply to Her Majesty's Minister's telegram was made, not on the ground of Colonel Felly's letters referred to, but because from study of the whole correspondence on record here, I was under a fixed impression that no other reply was possible, and if I have fallen into an error it has not been from any inattention to the instructions conveyed in your letter of the 20th September, 1873, but that, possibly from a misapprehension on my part, I bad not considered that despatch as intended to deal with the general question of legal jurisdiction, but as applying merely to a proposed change in the established ' practice ' in vogue—a practice of adjudicating, as I believed, in the absence of legal authority. 3. I understood the term ' legal' in this case in the sense of a formally conveyed authority based on legislative enactment or special order of the Crown or Government, where the powers are defined and limited, appeals provided for, and provision made for the enforcement of decisions. 4. Successive Residents in the Persian Gulf have brought to notice what they considered the absence of such legal powers. In 1844 Colonel Hcnnell, the Resident, represented that Consular power was required to enable him to enforce decisions on British subjects. It was at that time replied that the conferring of Consular power would be inconsistent with Treaty arrangements with Persia. In 1855 Captain Jones, then Resident, represented that as Act of Parliament, cap. 42, did not include Residents and Political Agents, it was requisite that formal powers should be specially conferred to render awards binding. The previous ruling was pointed out in reply. Colonel Pelly subsequently moved actively in the matter, and I was under the full impression that the question of a remedy to be applied being still under consideration pending final decision, the situation was as previously understood, that is, the absence of ' legal' powers in Persia. 5. In a Resolution of the Government of Bombay, dated 3rd August, 1872, I read as follows (paragraph 3):—'The answer to the second question, whether the existing practice has been found to be attended with any actual ill results, appears to have been in the negative. Nevertheless, the jurisdiction exercised by the Political Resident in the Persian ports is obviously of an unsatisfactory character, and ought to be put on a legal basis.' From this it would be inferred that the existing practice was to adjudicate without legal authority. 6. In a letter dated 14th December, 1871, Colonel Pelly reported to the Govern ment of Bombay—' I have been instructed by Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran that the question of Consular jurisdiction is under consideration, and therefore, and pending the introduction of such jurisdiction, any judicial inquiries which may be instituted by British authority in Persia must be liable to the inconvenience attending decisions given without jurisdiction.' 7. I did not therefore understand Colonel Pelly's letter of 19th September, 1872, as intended to raise the question of the legality of his jurisdiction, which would seem to have been decided in the negative by the Government of Bombay and by Her Majesty's Minister in Persia, but I conceived the point raised in that letter was relative to the existing practice which Colonel Pelly proposed to alter, because of the assumed absence of legal powers in view of relieving ' the Residency from an anxious and irregular responsibility.' The existing practice up to that time being understood to be exercising jurisdiction in absence of the 'legal' sanction. 8. When I had been officiating for some months as Resident during Colonel Pelly's absence on special duty, it struck me that it was necessary to draw the attention of Government to the proposed change of system, as I felt at some loss how to act. This I did in my letter dated 23rd July, 1873; and in reply was informed in your Office of 20th September, 1873, that ' as the question is under the consideration of the Home Government, and as there is reason to believe that Colonel Pelly was mistaken in his views as to the irregularity of the present practice referred to, no change whatever should be made pending further instructions.' This instruction, as I had understood it, was implicitly acted on by me, and the previous system of dealing with all cases has been since adhered to. The sense in which I had understood it I have mentioned in paragraph 2. 9. On receiving a Confidential telegram from Her Majesty's Minister inquiring if I had legal authority in Persia, it did not occur to me to doubt the reply \ should make, and I unhesitatingly stated that I had not legal jurisdiction. I regret now that the doubt did not arise in my mind, as I would then have referred the question to Government. 1 attach copies of Mr. Thomson's telegram and my reply. No other correspondence has passedbetween his Excellency and myself on this subject before or since, and 1 was not aware at the time that the question was put with reference to any particular pending case. 10. As I do not yet feel sure that I fully understand the views of Government on this question, I respectfully solicit such further instructions as His Excellency the Viceroy in Council may deem necessary and convenient to issue for my future guidance. At the Same time I venture to ask consideration of a few further remarks which I think it my duty to offer. 11. It is, I think, undoubtedly the case that hitherto the duty of adjudicating cases, when necessary, has been executed by successive Residents and their Assistants under a belief that the jurisdiction thus exercised rested on no legal basis, and that their authority was liable to be questioned at any moment, and that if so questioned thev were not in a position to enforce their decisions. That instances of such a kind have, if not wholly evaded, at least been very rare and unimportant, is due, 1 think, in a treat measure— 1st. To the great caution, prudence, and tact exercised by the Political Officers under the impression of the delicate nature of the subject. 2nd. That few cases have presented themselves for adjudication involving very large pecuniary interests. 3rd. That most of the British subjects residing within the limits of the jurisdiction are natives of India, who from natural temperament and other reasons are indisposed to raise such a question. 12. If cases of magnitude happened to occur, I think it extremely probable that the parties against whom awards should be made would, especially, if Englishmen, question the validity of such award. In cases of a refusal to abide by it, there seems to be no means of enforcing such judgment locally. 13. The above remarks apply to the relations between authority in the Gulf and the subjects of the British Government; but as regards Persian territory, I would beg attention to the fact that Her Majesty's Minister states that neither the Minister nor the Consuls in Persia are invested with judicial power. Would it not be considered anomalous if, under these circumstances, the Resident, unless under special order, were to claim such power ? 14. I am not myself of opinion that the system hitherto observed has as yet failed in a degree to necessitate further legislation, nor do I presume that a practice sanctioned by Government and acquiesced in by all interested is necessarily irregular, but 1 think that unless it were decided to introduce a thoroughly new system, it were better to have the strict legality of the present practice unaffirmed further than as regards the prescriptive right acquired from usage, as I consider it probable that the distinct affirmation of legal power might lead to issues being raised. It seems to me sufficient that Government should, as already done, intimate their wish that the practice should continue. If under such orders occasions arise for reference, the Political Officers concerned know thev can fully rely on the necessary support being accorded, and will at the same time continue to exercise caution to avoid the necessity for invoking such support. 16. The returns called for in paragraph 3 of the letter under reply will be prepared and forwarded. Inclosure 3 in No, 7. Mr. Taylour Thomson, C.B., to Lieutenant-Colonel Ross. Please inform me if you possess legal authority to adjudicate either personalis or by your representative at Bunder Abbass claims of British Indian subjects against another British Indian subject. Inclosure 4 in No. 7. Lieutenant-Colonel Ross to Mr. Taylour Thomson. 1 HAVE not legal jurisdiction.Inclosure 5 in No. 7. Mr, Thornton to Lieutenant-Colonel Ross. I AM directed to acknowlege the receipt of your letter, dated 31st December, 1875, relative to the jurisdiction exercised by the Resident in the Persian Oulf. 2. In reply, I am directed to acquaint you that this Office letter, dated 20th September, 1873, referred not to the procedure followed by the Resident in the investigation and settlement of claims and disputes arising between British and Persian subjects, but to the jurisdiction exercised by the Resident in such matters, and was intended to set at rest some doubts which had been raised by Colonel Pelly regarding the legality of that jurisdiction. In the opinion of the Government of India the undisputed usage of many years forms a legal and sufficient basis for the jurisdiction enjoyed by the Resident in the Persian ports, and you should continue to exercise that jurisdiction, and follow the accustomed procedure, until you receive orders to the contrary. 3. These considerations apply of course with greater force to disputes in which only British subjects are concerned; and I am directed to forward for your information copy of my letter of this date to Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, in reference to the letter dated 26th August, 1875, addressed by his Excellency to the Earl of Derby. Mr. Taylour Thomson has been informed that if he considers it expedient to adopt the course indicated in that letter, namely, to call ' upon the Persian Government to send Mouwareed to Bunder Abbass to be there tried by the Resident or his representative,' there is no reason why this should not be done. Should this course be adopted by Mr. Thomson, you will either proceed yourself, or depute one oi your assistants, to Bunder Abbass, to try the case in question. 4. The Governor-General in Council fully appreciates the caution, prudence, and tact which have been displayed by successive Residents in the Persian Gulf in the conduct of judicial matters ; and his Excellency in Council feels no doubt that the exercise of these qualities will prevent any difficulty from arising with the Persian authorities, in the event of your right to adjudicate in a case between British subjects within the limits ot a jurisdiction claimed by the Government of India, being questioned by them. Inclosure 6 in No. 7. Mr, Thornton to Mr. Taylour Thomson. WITH reference to your Excellency's despatch to the address oi Her Majesty 's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated August 26th, 1875, I am directed to forward copy of a correspondence* relative to the jurisdiction enjoyed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. Your Excellency will observe from this correspondence that the Government of India dissents from the statement telegraphed to you by the Political Residents in the Persian Gulf that he had not 'legally jurisdiction to adjudicate upon cases between British subjects on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf. The Governor-General in Counci maintains, on the contrary, that the Political Resident has such jurisdiction, based on usage and prescription. If, therefore, your Excellency considers it expedient to adopt the course indicated in your letter to the Earl of Derby, namely, to call upon 14 the Persian Government to send Mouwareed to Bunder Abbass to be there tried by the Resident or his representative,' his Excellency in Council is not aware of any reason why this should not be done; and in the event of your adopting this course. Colonel Ross has been instructed to proceed himself, or to depute one of his Assistants to Bunder Abbass xor the purpose of trying the case in question. 3. In the opinion of his Excellency in Council it is of importance that the Persian Government should not be led by silence on our part, to suppose that we could entertain their proposal that a case between British subjects should be investigated by Persian authorities within the limits of a jurisdiction claimed by the Government of India. ♦ To Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, November 29, 1875 ; From Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, December 31, 1875 ; To Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, February 23, 18'6.&lt;fe ,&gt;7'- ; - : ^^^ r -?v ;■/■/'' 'Ac-^'.-^'&amp;'-'p : '-.rZ ' &amp;$ -IK •::' •;.■ -.'•{■ -.-■J**. .„.• /■ '■ ■.■-j,'. &gt; , ' . / • /■,-. No. 8. Mr. Reilly to the Earl of Derby,—(Received May 8.) My Lord, 21, Delahay Street, Westminster, May 6, 1876. 1 RECEIVED Lord Tenterden's letter of 12th April, 1876, transmitting to me mrther papers on the subject of British Consular jurisdiction in Persia, and requesting for your Lordship any observations 1 might have to offer thereon, in accordance with the wish ot the Marquis of Salisbury, expressed in the India Office letter of 15th March, 1876 ; and i have accordingly prepared a further memorandum, which is inclosed, and which 1 submit to your Lordship. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) FRANS. S. REILLY. Inclosure in No. 8. Further Memorandum on British Extra-territorial Jurisdiction in Persia and in the Arab States on or near the Persian Gulf. I HE letter of the Government of India to the India Office comments on my memo- randum ol 4th November, 1874, with general assent, but with the indication of some differences of view, and the proposal of some additional arrangements. 2. Paragraph 6 of the letter suggests that ( he Convention might provide that the fact of an Indian's name (whether he is a subject of the British Crown or of a native Prince or State) being inserted in the registered lists, which should be kept by the Persian authorities, as well as at the British Consulate, shall be taken to be sufficient evidence of the man's legal position, and shall be binding on all parties.' 3. It will be important to confine the Convention, as far as may be, to general provisions. A provision making necessary the keeping of registers in any particular mode would almost certainly become embarrassing at some time. There would be great delay and trouble in getting an amendment made. 4. it would not, I should think, be too much to ask Persia to agree that a register kept by the British authorities in their own way should be conclusive. A provision might be admitted tor the communication from time to time of a copy of the register to the Persian authorities. It might also be stipulated, in the interest of Persia (and indeed of both parties) that any representation of the Persian authorities respecting the register should be taken into consideration by the British authorities. 5. In the same paragraph it is observed that it might also be considered whether a division into two classes would not be desirable in Persia as in Turkey. I am not informed what proposed arrangement this relates to. 6. The paragraph concludes with this observation :— *' It should also be noticed that at present our authorities exercise jurisdiction incases where the piaintift is British and the defendant neither British nor Persian, if the defendant consents. This is a class of suit not specifically mentioned in Mr. Reilly's classification. It would doubtless fall under this head No 6, if that were agreed on.' 7. I did not think it necessary to refer to this class of cases in the concluding summary of my former memorandum. I had adverted to them in the body of the memo randum (paragraph 31, section 4), with the observation that Persia was not concerned, and that, in relation to them, no further Convention with her would be needed, as by the German Treaty she waives jurisdiction over all foreigners, as among themselves. 8. It is, however, desirable to have a repetition of this waiver in the proposed Convention. 9. Paragraphs 9, 10.—The observations respecting criminal procedure and the extent oi appellate jurisdiction, criminal and civil, will have to be kept in view when the Order in Council comes to be settled. 10. Paragraph 10.—The right to have criminal and civil cases carried away out of Persia by appeal should be clearly secured by the Convention in general terms. This is one of the points on which the Russian and German Treaties will have to be supple mented. 11. Paragraph 11 suggests:— 'That tne British Courts should have power to remit to the Tribunals of the country the cognisance of criminal cases, when they think justice will be better done therebv.' [399] ^ ■rr ■■-■f-.wj.yr )12. Most probably experience in some class of cases has suggested this arrangement to the Government of India. It is, I think, new in connection with extra-territorial jurisdiction. It involves a partial abandonment of principle, li adopted, it should be carefully guarded. I think the Government of India might be asked to state in what circumstances, and with what safeguards, they contemplate that the proposed power should be exercised. 13. The letter of the Government of India incloses and adopts (paragraph 8) a minute by Mr. Hobhouse, in which he examines into the basis of the civil jurisdiction exercised by the British Government on t^e Persian seaboard. 14. The plan of obtaining a new Convention, as a foundation for the Order in Council which it is intended I should draw, having been approved by the Government of India (in the letter under consideration, paragraph 4), and by the Secretary of State for India (in the letter of Sir L. Mallet to Lord Tenterden of 27th January, 1875), it does not concern me to now discuss on what foundation the jurisdiction has hitherto rested, or will rest until the new Convention is obtained. This question has now become, even more than before, merely incidental, and, as such, I think I sufficiently adverted to it in my former memorandum, 15. I have, however, considered with care and deference Mr. Hobhouse^s minute ; but I am not induced to change the view indicated in my former memorandum. I think it may well be contended that the usage which existed before the war ceased in and by the war; that it was not necessarily restored on and by the peace ; and that the Treaty set up a new system. I do not see how it cQuld be maintained that the British nation may itself be, under the Treaty, the most favoured nation, so as to obtain the benefit of the antecedent usage, having immediately before the Treaty been in the state of extreme disfavour, namely, the state of war. The British nation had no favour of its own to carry on from the time before the Treaty to the time after it. The measure of its subsequent favour, as prescribed by the Treaty of Peace, is the favour to be from time to time shown to other nations. 16. Mr. Hobhouse (paragraph 9) puts this case :— 'Suppose that all the Treaties of the Persians with other nations were abrogated by war or otherwise, should we allow the contention that our Consuls' jurisdiction was abrogated too, and that the privileges of our subjects were gone uutil it pleased the Persians to make a new Treaty with us ? ' 17. An answer to this question is, that the supposition is too violent for practical consideration. Such a state of things cannot be contemplated as at all probable. But, if such a contention was set up by the Persians, and persisted in by them, it could only be disposed of by the ultimate argument of war. 18. It seems to me that the matter is now ripe for the negotiation of a Convention. Whether it is expedient that the negotiation of a Commercial Convention should be combined with it, is a question for Her Majesty's Government. 19. Colonel Pelly's Report of 22nd October, 1870, appears to be a document that should be in the hands of the British negotiators (especially with reference to Mr. Hob- house's view). It should also be accessible in this country when the Order in Council comes to be drawn. (Signed) FRANS. S. REILLY. Westminstery May 6, 1876.17 No. 9. Mr. Tay lour Thomson to the Eorl of Derby.—{Received June 5.) (No. 51.) My Lord, Tehran, May 1, 1876. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith, for your Lordship's consideration, copy of a despatch which I have received from the Officiating Secretary to the Government of India giving cover to a correspondence which has passed between the Government ot India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, relative to the jurisdiction legally possessed by that officer in this country. The circumstances under which the correspondence arose were the following:— A British Indian subject, a Hindoo named Marwareed. residing at Kerman, having became a Mahomedan with the object of defrauding other British Indian subjects trading in this country who had pecuniary claims against him, the matter was referred to Her Majesty's Legation. All the parties concerned beinii British subjects, it was impossible to admit jurisdiction by the Persian authorities in the adjustment of the question, and having no jurisdiction myself. I telegraphed to the British Resident at Bushire, to know if he had judicial powers in Persia, and he replied that he had not legal jurisdiction. Your Lordship will perceive from the above despatch that the Government of India dissents from the statement telegraphed to me by the Political Resident, that he had not legally jurisdiction to adjudicate upon cases between British subjects on the seaboard ot the Persian Gulf, the Governor-General in Council maintaining, on the contrary, that the Political Resident has such jurisdiction based on usage and prescription, and his Excellency has therefore intimated to me, in the event of my acting upon this view of the case, and calling upon the Persian Government to cause Marwareed to be sent to Bunder Abbass, that the Resident had been instructed to proceed there himself or to depute one of his assistants for the purpose of trying the case in questioi. It is very desirable that, on the one hand, British Indian subjects should not be allowed in seemingly fraudulent cases, similar to the present, to entertain the idea that they may set at defiance British authority ; and, on the other, that the Persian Govern ment should not be led to conclude that we are powerless to deal with cases in this country which are exclusively reserved for our decision by Treaty, but I have considered it more prudent undt r the circumstances to await your Lordship's instructions before taking steps to have Marwareed s case investigated and adjudicated upon at Bunder Abbass by the British Resident or his Representative. In the last paragraph of the despatch from the Government of India to the Resident at Bushire, dateM Februaiy 23, 1876 (inclosed in the despatch ol the Indian Government to me above referred to), the Governor-General alludes to difficulties which it may be anticipated might arise with the Persian authorities in the event ot the Resident's riiiht to adjudicate in a case between British subjects within tlie limits of a jurisdiction claimed by the Government of India beinir questioned by them. But by the first clause of the Vllth Article of the Treaty of Toorkomanchai, which in virtue of our most-favoured nation clause in the Treaty of Paris of 1857, is applicable to us, it is stipulated that, 'tous les proc&amp;s et toutes affaires litigieuses entre les sujets Russes seront soumis exclusivement ^ I'examination et la decision de la Mission on des ( onsuls de la Russie, conformement aux lois et coutumes de I'Empire de Kussie.' 1 he real questional issue is, therefore, not as between the British and Persian Governments, but as to the responsibility which would be incurred by a British official in Persia in the event of his adjudicating in a case between British subjects and the validity of his award being disputed in an English Court of Law by the party to whom the decision was adverse.

Your Excellency will observe, from this correspondence, that the Government of [399] ' F18 ■&gt; India dissents from the statement telegraphed to you by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that he had not 'legally jurisdiction' to adjudicate upon cases between British subjects on the sea-board of the Persian Gulf, the Governor-General in Council maintaining, on the contrary, that the Political Resident has such jurisdiction, based on usage and prescription ; if, therefore, your Excellency considers it expedient to adopt the course indicated in vour letter to the Earl ot Derby, namely, to cai! upon a the Persian Government to send Marwareed to Bunder Abbass, to be there tried by the Resident or his representative/' his Excellency in Council is not aware of any reason why this should not be done, and in the event of your adopting this course. Colonel Ross has been instructed to proceed himself, or to depute one of his assistants, to Bunder Abbass, for the purpose of trying the case in question. In the opinion of his Excellency in Council, it is of importance that the Persian Government should not be led, by silence on our part, to suppose that we could entertain their proposal that a case between British subjects should be investigated by Persian authorities within the limits of a jurisdiction claimed by the Government of India. (Signed) hai &amp; J. H. THORNTON, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, Inclosure 2 in No. 9. Mr, Hervey to Lieutenant-Colonel Ross. £j r Fort William, November 29, 1875. 1 AM directed to forward copy of a letter from Her Majesty's Minister in Persia to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated the 26th August, 1 ^75, relative to ^ claim preferred by'a British Hindoo meichant residing at Bunder Abbass, against another British Hindoo merchant residing at Kerman, who was supposed to have adopted the Moham medan religion, with the view of defrauding his creditors. 2 With reference to vour telegraphic intimation to Mr. Taylour Thompson that you had not ' legally jurisdiction,' I am directed to inquire whether the course taken by you re?ts on the ground formerly assigned by Colonel Pelly, in his letters of October 22, 1870. and September 19, 1»72, for doubting the legality of his jurisdiction ; if so, 1 am directed to refer you to this office letter dated the 20th September, 1873, in which you were informed that, as there was reason to believe Colonel Pelly ' was mistaken in his views as to the irregularity of the present practice referred to, no change whatever should be made pending further instructions.' Although these orders were issued principally with the view of providing for claims and disputes arising between british and Persian subjects, it is obvious that they apply with still greater force to cases in which both parties are British subjects. 3. I am also to request that you will furnish the Government ol India, at your early convenience, with a tabulated statement showing the number, description, and value of all cases, civil and criminal, adjudicated upon by you and your assistant during the three years ending the 31st December, 1875, discriminating between the various juris dictions in the manner shown by Colonel Pelly in his letter of the 22nd October, 1870. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) F. HER\E\, Under-Secretary to the Government of India. Inclosure 3 in No. 9. Lieutenant-Colonel Ross to Mr. Hervey. S ip , British Residency, Persian Gulf, Bushire, December 31, 1875. J HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Under Secretary to the Government's letter dated 29th November, 1875, forwarding a copy of a letter dated 26th August, 1875, from Her Majesty's Minister in Persia to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and inquiring whether my reply to his Excellency to the effect that 1 had not 'legal jurisdiction ' rested on the ground assigned by Colonel Pelly in his letters to the Government of Bombay of 22nd October, 1870,'and 19th September, 1872, for doubting ihe legality of his jurisdiction, and if so, directing my attention to your letter id 20th September, 1873, in which 1 was informed that, as there was ' reason to believe thatCplonel Pelly was mistaken in bis views as to the irregularity of the present practice referred to, no change whatever should be made pending fuither instructions.' 2. I respectfully beg to explain that my reply to f ler Majesty s Minister s lelograni was made, not on the ground ot Colonel Pelly's letters referred to, but because from study of the whole correspondence on record here, I was under a tixed impression tnat no other reply was possible, and if 1 have fallen into an error it has not been from any iuattenlion to the instructions conveyed in your letter oi the 20th September, 187'5, but that, po&gt;sibl\ from a misapprehension on my part, 1 had not considered that despatch as intended to deal with the general question of legal jurisdiction, but as applying merely to a proposed change in the established ' practice ' in vogue—a practice ot adjudicating, as i believed, in the absence of legal authority. ?. I understood 'legal' in this case in ihe sense of a formally conveyed authority based on legislative enactment or special order of the Crown or Ciovernment, where the powers are detined and limited, appeals provided for, and provisions made ior the entorce- ment of decisions. 4. Successive Residents in the Persian Gulf have brought to notice what they considered the absence of such legal powers. In 1844 Colonel Bennett, the Kesident, represented that Consular power was required to enable him to enforce decisions on British subjects. It was at that time replied that the conferring ot Consular power would be inconsistent with Treaty arrangements with Persia. In 1855 Captain Jones, then Resident, represented that, as Act of Parliament, cap. 42, did not mclude Residents and Political Agents, it was requisite that formal powers should be specially conferred to render awards binding. The previous ruling was pointed out in reply. Colonel Pelly subse quently moved actively in the matter, and I was under the full impression that the question of a remedy to be applied being still under consideration, pending final decision, the situation was as previously understood, that is, the absence ot ' legal powers in Persia. 5. In a resolution of the Government of Bombay dated 3rd August, 18&lt; 2, I read as follows (paragraph 3): 44 The answer to the second question whether the existing practice has been found to be attended with any actual ill-results appears to have been in the negative. xXevertheless the jurisdiction exercised by the Political Resident in the Persian ports is obviously of an unsatisfactory character, and ought to be put on a legal basis. From this it would be inferred that the existing practice was to adjudicate without legal authority. 6. In a letter dated 14th December, 1871, Colonel Pelly reported to the Government of Bombay: 14 1 have been instructed by Her Majesty's Minister at 1 ehran that the question of Consular jurisdiction is under consideration, and, therefore, pending the intro duction of such jurisdiction, any judicial inquiries which may be instituted by British authority in Persia must be liable to the inconvenience attending decisions given without jurisdiction.' 7. I did not, therefore, understand Colonel Pelly s letter of 19th September, 1872, as intended to raise the question of the legality of his jurisdiction, which would seem to have been decided in the negative by the Government or Bombay and by Her Majesty s Minister in Persia, but 1 conceived the point raised in that letter was relative to the^ existing practice which Colonel Pelly proposed to alter because of the assumed absence Oi legal powers in view of relieving 11 the Residency from an anxious and irregular responsi bility.' The existing practice up to that time being understood to be exercising jurisdic tion in the absence of legal sanction. 8. When 1 had been officiating for some months as Resident during ( olonel Pelly s absence on special duty, 'it struck me that it was necessary to draw Hie attention ot Government to the proposed change of system, as I felt at some loss how to act. 1 his I did in my letter dated 23rd July, 1873, and, in reply, was informed in your office of the 20th September, 1873, that ' as the question is under consideration of the Home Govern ment, and as there is reason to believe that Colonel Pelly was mistaken in his views us to the irregularity of the present practice referred to, no change whatever should be made pending further instructions. This instruction, as I had understood it, was implicitly acted on by me, and the previous system of dealing with all cases has since been adhered to. The sense in which I had understood it I have mentioned in paragraph 2. 9. On receiving a confidential telegram from Her Majesty's Minister, inquiring it - I had legal authority in Persia, it did not occur to me to doubt the reply I should make, and I unhesitatingly stated that I had not legal jurisdiction. I regret now that the doubt did not arise in my mind, as I would then have referred the question to Government. I attach copies of Mr. Thomson's telegram and my reply^ No other correspondence has passed between his Excellency and me on this subject betore or since,20 and I was not aware at the time that the question was put with reference to any parti cular pendinir case. 10. As I do not yet feel sure that I fully understand the views of Government on this question. I respectfully solicit such further instructions as his Excellency the Viceroy in Council may deem necessary and convenient to issue tor my future guidance. At the same time 1 venture to ask consideration of a few further remarks, which I think it my duty to offer. 11. It is, ! think, undoubtedly the case that hitherto the duty of adjudicating cases when necessary has heen executed by successive Residents and their assistants under a belief that the jurisdiction thus exercisevl rested on in legal basis, and that their authority was liable to be questioned at any moment, and that, if so questioned, they were not in a position to enforce their decisions. That instances of such a kind have, it' not wholly evaded, at least been very rare and unimportant, is due, I think, in great measure, first, to the great caution, prudence, and tact exercised by the political officers under the impression of the delicate nature of the subject; secondly, that tew cases have presented themselves for adjudication involving very large pecuniary inteie?ts ; thirdly, that most of the British subjects residing within the limits of the jurisdiction are natives of India who from natural temperament and other reasons are indisposed to raise such a question. 12. Jf cases of magnitude happened to occur, 1 think it extremely probable that the parties against whom awards should be made, would, especially if Englishmen, question the validity of such award. In cases of refusal to abide by it, there seems to be no means of enforcing such judgment locally. 13. The above remarks apply to the relations between authority in the Gulf and the subjects of the British Government, but as regards Persian territory, 1 would beg attention to the fact that Her Majesty's Minister states that neither the Minister nor the Consuls in Persia are invested with judicial power. Would it not be considered anomalous if, under these circumstances, the Resident, unless under special order, were to claim such power. 14. I am not nuself of opinion that the system hitherto observed has as yet failed in a degree to necessitate further legislation, nor do I presume that a practice sanctioned by Government and acquiesced in by all interested is necessarily irregular, but I think that unless it was decided to introduce a thoroughly new system it were better to have the legality of the present practice unaffirmed further than as regards the prescriptive right acquired from usage; as I consider it probable that the distinct affirmation of legal power might lead to issues being raised. It seems to me sufficient that Government should, as already done, intimate their wish that the practice should continue. If under such orders occasions arise for reference, the Political Officers concerned know they can fully rely on the necessary support being accorded, and will at the same time continue to exercise caution to avoid the necessity for invoking such support. 15. The returns called for in paragraph 3 of the letter under reply will be prepared and forwarded. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) E. C.
