King Ghazi is most anxious to settle this case without further delay and today his Private Secretary defin itely undertook to validate Shaikhs title to all property claimed by Abdul Zuhair on payment of £. 3000. This is the lowest sum which would enable claimant to free himself from financial embarrassment with his lawyers, who are in a pxj position to retaliate strongly if disciplinary action is taken against them. Objections to this proposal are 1. Sum mentioned is &lt;£• 1000* more than the mastimum offered by Humphreys. 2. Bashiyah estate is not included. On the other hand there is no chance of validating law being passed and solution on lines now suggested will become more difficult and costly as time goes on. In the circumstances I earnestly hope to receive your authorization to offer sum not exceeding # &lt;£. 3000. on the conditions lafcd down in Humphreys* despatch under reference. As plaintiff's lav/yers can v/ithin the next fortnight take legal action embarrassing further both plaintiff and Shaikh it is essential that I should know your decision within the next ten days.

In paragraph 6 of his despatch Colonel Fowle puts forniArd the view that the correct formula for calculating the Shaikh^ losses in respect of tax collected from merchants purchasing and exporting his dates since the introduction of the istihlak tax is 10% and not as suggested in Sir Francis Humphrys» despatch ITo. 162 of the 22nd Miarch addressed to the Foreign Offfice. I note, however, that in discussing the calculations on this point colonel Fowle states that Sir Francis 'had in mind the previous miri tax*. 3. If you will refer to the relevant passage in Sir Francis Humphrys 1 despatch quoted above you will observe that his reason for suggesting that the correct formula was 8^ vas that at the time of the introduction of the istihlak tax the customs export duty was reduced by 2%, This reduction in customs export duty, which has nothing to do with the previous miri tax and in respect of which the Shaikh was never promised exemption, was an integral part of the new system of taxation on dates introduced by the Iraqi Government. Had the merchants purchased The Honourable the Officiating i Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. h' i1 f ' 2. purchased the dates before the introduction of the istihlak tax they would Have paid of their value as customs duty on export. Under the present system the merchants are called upon to pay 11^ of the value as combined customs and istihlak taxation. H The net loss to the Shaikh,through the merchants, is therefore a?5 of the value of the crop and not 10%, and this appears to be the correct percentage to ta.;e for the purpose of assessing his losses consequent upon the introduction of the istihlak system. 4.

Both King^ secretary and Ifinister for Foreign Affairs ask me to wait in patienee while they deal with the lawyer and now assure me that the time limit indicated in the last paragraph of my telegram No. 138 does not in present oircumstanoes operate. As it was the Iraqis who took the initiative - incident ally in the presence of Colonel Loch • I think it 'better for taotieal reasons not to betray too much eagerness for immediate settlement as this may tend to stiffen resistance.

I have th© honour to transait herewith in continuation of paragraph Ifc of bir Prhncis Huraphrys* despatch of Mcrch 22nd last, Kd. 168, a cony of the correspondence which tiaa naased between His Majesty'c 'imbassy and the a^ent in Beorah of the Shaikh of Mohamroerah regarding the loaees incurred by the Phalkh as a result of the levy of ietihlak tax on the nroduce of his exempted properties in Iraq. 2. The agent of the Shaikh claima that his principal has been put to losses on tnis account to a total of 10.1,^38/084 during the year 1932 and ID.2,5o4/?0B during the year 1933. 3. The figures of quantity contained in hie claim, in the absence of supporting voucuers, have not been checked. It would in fact be imnoasible to verify them without an exnaustive examination of the books kept by the a*,ent, as, although proof might be forthcoming that he actually sold on benalf of the Shaikh the quantities of dates mentioned in the claim, there would be no certainty that they wer.? the produce of the tax-exempted properties, or that they did not Include the value of produce purchased by the agent frorr the ehare of the crop due to the cultlvatore on the estates. 4. It is pertinent to the consideration of the claim that it is in respect of a quantity of dates considerably larger than that covered by thr? similar claim of the Shaikh The Right honourable 6ir John 8imon, CKC.H.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc etc^ J &amp; Shaikh of Kuwait, altnou^h the exempted estates of the latter were asaesaed by the revenue authoritiea of the Iraqi Government ae having twice the bearing capacity of the former. Omitting the figaree of compeneation paid to cultivators in each case, the Bhaiich of Kuwait's claim accounte for 2,625 tons of dates in 193? and g,0P4 tons in 1933. whereas the Bhaikh of Mohammerah claims to i ■ » - &lt;'■ - i—■' ' 1 'i. —■- i n in miih -1 1111 fWiwi Mt' ~i rr i-rt— n i .■■inii i-rr-wrm ■ nwi n. jn 'ri JtJM u/i '- Q ve disposed of 4,^64 tons in 193? and 4,266 tons apT^roxi mately in 1933. 6. It is also significant that the claim for 1933 is in respect of an equal quantity of dates as that for 1931b, whereas it is well known that the 1933 crop was a poor one which on no estate produced a crop of more than 70% of that of 1932, and in most cases considerably less. 6. The values at which the quantities have been converted into casn nave been caecked with those ruling in Basrah during the period covered by the claim, and there appears to be no grounds for questioning their accuracy. The items in the claim, when analysed, fall into the following categories.- 193^. 1933 » l£. 'jd7 1. Compensation naid to cultivators on account of their liability to pay iatihlak tax on their ahares. .. 759/613 96*/^14 2. Dates from exempted estates sold to merchants, 3.

Thoee commcntE are equally applicable in this inatance. 8. Item 2, which repretenta 10. of the aale price of the dates, ie diviaible into two catefforiesi (a) patet on which the purchaser paid the latihlak tax, and (b) Patea which were told on the understanding that the purchaser would deduct the tax from the price. In each case the inference is that the agent would have received ^n additional 10&gt; in cash if the dwtea had been sold with no liability to istihlak taxation, but It la by no means certain that the full additional 10 would have accrued to the Shaikh. It is not possible to effect any useful comparison with the claim of the rheikh of Kuwait, ai he, with his much larger estates, sold very little produce within Iraq, whereas this claim is in respect of 1 ,600 tons of dates in 1932 and 2,600 tons in 1933. /-wO s )L y 9.

The Financial Secretary to H.E.the British Ambassador, Baghdad. ^ w /V Sir, I an in receipt of your communication No.202/5/34 dated 24th February 1934 regarding this istihlak tax paid on the dates belonging to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khazaal Khan during 1932 and 1933. I fifould beg to point out, at the outset, that it ia almost impossible to produce the receipt for the istihlak tax paid on all the dates referred to, because of the following reasons;- (1) Before the istihlak was introduced, the fellahs used to supply the Shaikh with 60^- of the produce; but with the introduction of the istihlak tax, the fellahs supplied him with 56f only, the difference being allowed to them to enable them to pay the istihlak tax on their share. The fellahs have not taken out receipts for their shares and it is not possible for them to obtain these. They must have sold their dates to various parties, who have paid the istihlak tax thereon, and it is certain, in my hunible opinion, that they cannot trace the istihlak receipts for the quantities sold by them. I am, however, in possessiai of the agreements made with the fellahs on different properties showing the fact that they have been allowed 4f. r in excels of their previous shares to enable them to pay the istihlak tax. (2) Some of the dates belonging to the Shaikh h ve been sold to different merchants at Basrah and these merchants have themselves paid the istihlak tax to the Government when they exported those dates from Basrah together with other dates bought by them from other parties. The only method in which we can prove the fact is to obtain a certificate from each buyer showing the quantity bought by him, and the date and number of the customs receipt or declaration that he has paid the tax on the dates. I shall be glad to be informed as to whether I should take the necessary action to obtain such certificat e s # (3) Some of the dates have been sold to merchants on the underst nding that they deducted the Istihlak tax from the price. May I obtain certificates Srom the purchasers to this effect? Some /(ir4 Some of the dates have 'been shipped abroad on the Shaikh^ account and I can produce the necessary customs documents showing that istihlak tax has been paid thereon. I shall collect these and keep them in readiness to 'be used in oBGe of need. r With regard to para. 4 of your communication under reference, I beg to inform you that the statements submitted by me only relate to those properties now belonging to my principal which were in his possession prior to 1914. I must conclude with an apology for the delaf which has taken place in submitting this reply.

This procedure, as alre^tly explained in my letter No.C-223, dated the 28th July 1934, has been ruled out of the question, since His Excellency the Shaikh, as an independent Ruler, has once before refused to comply with a similar demand and, it would appear, is fully justified in doing so again. 4. I would, therefore, request, if you see no objection, that urgent representation throug^i the usual channel may bu made to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, asking for instructions to be issued to the Basra Jourt not to proceed with the case pending settlement of the matter under rs f erenGe. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Ilajor, Political Agent, Kuwait.73 Translation of a confidential letter No.H4/l710, dated the 15th Jamad Thani 1353, corresponding to the 23rd September 1934, from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait, pi After Compliments, T .7ith reference to my letter No # R4/l585, dated the 13th Rabi* Thani 1353, corresponding to the 26th July 1934, I forward, herewith, copy of a letter No,R/l/86, dated the 21st September 1934, which I have received from my lawyer at Basra, regarding the question of talcing an oath in respect of those dates belonging to me, which the fellaheen of ?ao have refused to hand over to me # After many proceedings the abovs|ment ioned dates were proved to be due to me from the said fellaheen. These fellaheen, however, have since then been endeavouring to evade payment; and the Court, as you will see, has lately decided that I should appear personally on the 29th October 1934 and take the oath before the Court, In a previous letter I wrote to you, I requested that the matter might kindly be referred to the British Embassy at Baghdad for necessary action* I am not alarmed about swearing this oath, for what I have claimed is my rightful property, but it is quite impossible for me to be present personally as desired by the Court. This fact is well known to them (the Iraq officials) but they are endeavouring to make me lose my rights by making such trifling excuses, else why should they object to my taking the oath indirectly through you as was done before. I would refer you to Colonel Dickson's letter to me, Ho. 23, dated the 23rd Rabi r Thani 1352 (14/8/33) and my reply to him, No.R/3/1130, dated the 24th Rabi' Thani 135 '(.5.8.33) from which you/will perceive that the Iraq Gove/nrient had once asked through the British Embassy, Bar xj c ., that an oath be swon* by me indirectly. hU^Ek 1 beg/- 2 - 70- I beg, therefore, to request that you will kindly take up this matter and do your best to get it settled before the date specified (for me to present myself before the Court) so that we may not lose our rights, I am confident that His Majesty* s G-ov ernment do not wish our rights to be usurped, and that they will defend our prestige by every means. Usual Ending.Translation of a letter IIo.n/l /86, dated the ^ 21st September 1954, received by His Excellency bhaikh)V Sir Ahmad al Jabir as—Sabah, K,C.I. Ruler of Kuwait, from his lawyer at Basra. Respects etc. I wrote to Your Excellency previously to the effect that the Ministry of Justice had notified the courts here that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs objected to the conveyance to Your Excellency of the form of oath which was to be sworn by Your 'ixcellency in connection with the cases lodged against certain T, Taaba n fellaheen of Fao. Pleadings had taken place for 48 cases out of 55 cases of precautionary distraint originally lodged against some of the 'Taaba' fellaheen of Fao. The result in them all was that Your Excellency^ rights were confirmed, and the correctness of the Pledge Sanads' which i had last year obtained from the said fellaheen was proved - and consequent ly your Excellency's right of ownership. The opponent's lawyer, however, alleged that the correct quantities of dates have been fully delivered. But as there was no way to prove such delivery against the Sanads we hold, save by production of signed receipts, and as the fellaheen were unabl&lt; to produce such receipts, their lawyer demanded that Tr our Excellency should taken an oath that you have not received the correct quantities of dates mentioned in the Sanads which we hold and ^tiich have been shown to the Court. Owing to the objection of the linistry of Justice f which acted in conformity with the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the administration of the oath to Your Excellency through the British Consul at ^.uwait, the Court has now decided that Your Excellency should be present personally at the Court on the 29th October 1954 to s^wear the oath required from Your Excellency. The opponents' lawyer knew perfectly well that his clients, the fellaheen had not paid the correct quantities_ - 2 - f * lb quantities of dates, but as he knew also that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs had objected to Your Excellency swearing the oath indirectly and was sure that Your Excellency would never appear before the Court personally, he tried to prove his allegation by any means, Tour Excellency is well aware of the great difficulties and obstacles, with which I have been confronted since the time Your Excellency entrusted to me the administration of your vast properties, and how I succeeded in obtaining from your opponents those legal documents which proved Your Excellency's rights. Now if these rights are going to be lost in such an unfortunate way, there will be by no means by which to recover your rights and to protect your properties in future; and the fellaheen and 'Taabeen^ will no doubt be encouraged to usurp Your Excellency^ rights. I beg, therefore, to request that measures necessary for insuring the consent of the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Your Excellency swearing the oath indirectly through the British Consul at Kuwait, as is the procedure followed by all the courts of Iraq, be taken immediately, and that the Ministry's consent be communicated to the courts here before the 29th October; otherwise the court will no doubt consider that Your Excellency is evading the oath and will decide on the rejection of all our cases because of Your Excellency's failure to appear on the day specified. Again I request that the matter may be put right while there is time, otherwise we will lose our rights and with them Rs.6000/- approximately, which we have paid as expenses and fees of the distraint and cases and which should be incurred by the opponents, when decision is issued in our favour after Your Excellency has taken the oath required.

Reference your Express Letter 953»-S of 9th Octoloer 1934 regarding the administration of the oath to the Shaikh of Koweit. The reply which I have received to ray representations to the Iraqi Government is that as the Shaikh has consisteiitl^ refused to accept service of judicial documents emanating from Iraqi Courts when the outcome might 'be to his dis advantage he cannot expect to 'be given an opportunity of accepting service when he believes it to 'be in his intereats to do so. They say he must either accept service of all documents or none. If he will accept all pending and future judicial documents they will send a form of oath for administration in Koweit, Their attitude is quite logical and I consider that as the Shaikh has denied the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts in the other pending land cases he should not have 'brought the Pao cases in the Basra Courts without first having asked our advice on the matter. His position is now gravely prejudiced. It will obviously be unwise for the Shaikh, in order to save the Fao cases, to accept service of all judicial documents and thereby endanger our chances of settling the Paddaghiyah case out of court and he must maintain for the present his attitude of refusing to accept service. In order to provide against the Fao casee being decided against him in default I have with some difficulty secure^ a ve^b 0 ! promise from the 1 Iraqi Government that the Court will postpone hearing them for a month.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram Ko.276, dated the 24th October, I have the honour to enclose for your information, translations of the following documents: (a) Confidential letter (marked URG j SI.T ) i.o.ii»4/l730 i f' dated the 20th October 1934 from H»Jl. the Shaikh to myself, with following enclosures: ^ f' ■ (b) Extract from letter 'o.Sl/101, dated asra, the Jk 17th October 1954, from llr.Gabriel, Attorney to the Shai kh. i*. (c) Letter No.Nil, dated the 4th October from Justice of the Peace Huqqi al Taibaji to Messrs:Gabriel and Partner. The letters speak for themselves. 2. He, the Shaikh, followed up his letter ((a)above) by an official visit to the Agency on 25rd October, and recapitulated at length and with some excitement, the events leading up to the efforts of the Iraq Government to short circuit H.M* s Embassy in Baghdad, anc. get documents served direct on him, the shaikh, and also the demand L j L of the Abul Khasib (Basra) Court, that the Shaikh should attend in person and take certain oath by 29tli Ccoober else the said Court's order already given in his favour against certain recalcitrant fellahs, would oe declared null and void. 5. ^s the Shaikh became somewhat heated during thedurin • the recital of the story, I suggested that he should send me-his Secretary, 'I. . ulla oaleh, a man o' great shrewdness, to explain the ^ole trouble to me ^ro 1 its incipiency. This Eis Jlxcellency agreed to do, and shortly after his departure, he sent along the official in question. 4. IC.B.lIulla oaleh gave me the following story, which to enable the situation to be quite clearly understood, I am repeating somewhat at length below, although the relevant facts appear to have already been reported by ::ajor /atts, before I returned from leave. (a) In the early Summer of 1923 and before the Date crop had ripened, the ihaikh 1 s fellahs --ere ~iven certain money advarces to improve their holdings, and accordine to usual custom 'thammaned' T the forthcoming crop, that is to say, they contracted to pay their landlord his share of the date crop for 1933, as soon as it was ripe, the balance of the crop going to themselves. 'Thaman*' was carried through ty the Shaikh's lawyer, Kr..Gabriel, and regular ''Se.nads' were taken from the fellahs. (b) hen the Autumn came round some 53 fellahs knowi as 'Taaba' or 'Taabeen^ consisting mostly of the same persons who gave trouble in 1932, suddenly refused to pay the Shail'Ji his land lord^ share. The amounts due from these 53 men, came to approximately 1600 Iraqi I'aunds of fates (i.e.ESO.OOO lbs.) valued at \s.8000 apart from money advances. (c) The fhaikh's lawyer dm instructions fron the Shaikh did not worry about certain other fellahs who also owed dates, but whose debts were trifling, but took a serious view of the cases of the men mentioned above, and who apparently once again were out for trouble (d) The .xgent after repeatedly warning the 53 men, put them i to Court at ^fbul xChasib, a- 3 - a sub court of asra, in Januaiy 19S4. The Court started postponing the case for various reasons until June 1934, when it final ly gave judgement in favour of the Shaikh and ordered the fellahs to pay. The fellahs, who had engaged a local lawyer, while accepting the Courts judgement petitioned Baghdad and prayed that as was customary in such cases the shaikh himself as their landlord should b^fuade to swear an oath that he had not received any part of the dates due to him from them. Apparently the next move (and this has been stated to be a fact by the Shaikhs lawyer) was for the I inistry of Justice in .a- hdad, acting on specific instructions from the I'oreign 1 inistry to instruct the Basra Courts not only to order the Shaikh to take the necessary oath, but also to inform the Shaikh that he should appear in person at Abdul Ehasib, and take the said oath by the 29th October 1934, otherwise his already won case against his tenants would go by default. The Shaikh's Lawyer protested strongly, and pointed out that it was impossible as well as unreasonable to expect that the Shaikh, an independent Toiler, should come up to Basra, and added that his master would most willingly, as he had done on a sii ilar occasion in August 1933, take the necessary oath in writing before the Chief Judge of Kuwait ( azi), have the document attested by HJI*s Political ^gent, Kuwait, and send same to the Court through the medium of the British Ambassador, Baghdad. The Court refused the request and demanded the Shaikh's personal presence, on the plea that- 4 - 10 * that an oath taken in another place and outside the precincts of the Court was invalid. (j) The Court in the meantime and at the request of the Shaikhs Lawyer passed a further order that the dates of the defendants should be distrained till the 29th October (i.e. they were forbidden to sell or part with them), (k) The next act of the Lawyer was to report the situation to the Shaikh, and to urge him to take the case up with all possible speed, with the Political Resident and the British Ambassador. (1) This was done and the Shaikh wrote his letters NO.R4/1585, dated the 26th July 1934, and Io.1710, dated the 22nd September 1934 both of which were forwarded to you by I'lajor . r atts. (m) The Shaikh's Lawyer holds four special Powers of Attorney from Shaikh under which he is authorized, among other things,to take full charge of his Faddaghiyeh, - ? ao, llataawa and Basra House properties, and proceed against any tenants in the local courts, who may create dif iculties, or do not pay rentals etc. These Powers of Attorney have each been seperately registered in Baghdad in the Ministry of Justice under date 2nd January 1934. I have put down the above narrative of events I have no reason to suppose them exaggeratecU exactly as told me by the Shaikh and by his Secretary, and J_ I cannot naturally vouch for every thing told me, until I have seen Ilr.Gabriel, the Shaikh's Lawyer. r his I hope to do on 30th October. 6. Prima facie, and on the assumption that the main facts are correct, I think that che Iraq G-overnment are _ Ihmbi - 5 - |0&lt;4 are, to put it in the mildest possible way, showing most regrettable lack of courtesy towards a friendly and neighbour -ing ruler, who after all is acting in the only legal manner open to him, in his efforts to recover rental and advances of money from his tenants. 7. As far as I can see the Shaikh has a perfectly good case, and on the following grounds: (a) He has in the past refused to agree to service of any documents on Kuwait subjects, issuing from the Iraq Courts, except through the British i^mbassador. The Iraq Government accepted this point of view and for long have acted accordingly. Thy then should the Iraq Courts suddenly startj and apparently at the instance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, try and short circuit the Embassy and upset established procedure ina matter concerning himself personally The reply is pretty obvious, I think. (b) There is perfectly good precedent for the Shaikh taking any oath required of him by the Iraq Courts, before the Chief Judge of Kuwait. The documents being attested by the Political Agent. (c) The Iraq Ministry of foreign Affairs for political reasons would appear to have interfered improperly in the affairs of the Court at Abul Khasib, firstly by refusing to forv/ard through the proper channel, certain papers which the Court wanted served on the Shaikh, and s econdly by insisting that the Shaikh should be told by the said Court that he must attend and take a certain oath in person and by a certain date on pc.in of losing his whole case. 8. Although I know little about Law, I believe it is the current practice among world states, when civil suits are involved, for foreign nationals to be permitted to take oath before the judicial authorities of their ot.h country, and have same attested and forwarded through the ordinary Diplomatic channels to the country, where Courts are dealing with the matter. 9./9. It clearly, I think, would be dangerous and unwise for the Shaikh to attend the Iraq Courts in person, even if he wished to do so in private capacity, seeing that questions of his property^ in which His I.Iajesty T s Gov eminent are peculiarly and definitely intereste^ are involved and I cannot but think that you will agree with this view.

The period of tie decreed for the oath will come to an end on the 2 9th October 1934. If an order to the Court authorizing it to accept my oath indirectly (i.e. in Kuwait in presence of the Qadhi and H.l r s Political Agent] be not issued by the Iraqi Ministry of foreign Affairs, we shall lose the case and our rights due from the fellaheen will be forfeited.

The letter and I ulhaqs were sent round to the Agency by the Shaikh without the usual covering letter. They arrived by the hand of the shaikh's -.ecretary , K.B. Hulla Saleh. The latter explained that His -ilxcellency had just received the letter 'rom Basra by special messenger and wanted to know my opinion on l-'r.Gabriel* s proposal that he should plead as per Kulhaq. I and Tallin that that he, the Shaikh, should proceed to Fao and there take the oath required of him by the Iraq Courts there.. 3. I informed the Shaikh*s Secretary that I was definitely not at all in favour of either of his Lawyer's suggestions, in fact that I thoroughly condemned them both^ and requested him to tell his master so at once. 4. Clearly one of two things was happening: Either (a) Mr•Gabriel from strain or overwork was losing his balance or (b) he was deliberately leading the Shaikh into a trap, in an effort to please the other side. 5. To my mind proposal I was foolish, and proposal II./proposal II was even more so seeing that if the Shaikh in a moment of panic adopted it, he would be playing straight into the Iraq Government's hands. This quite apart from going behind the back of His liajesty's Government, 6. I saw His Dxcellency the Shaikh myself later in the day, and he at once rushed forward and thanked me for my advice as sent through his ecretary. He laughingly said that he had himself never dreamed of acting on his Lawyer's suggestion, but had merely desired to know if my views were the same as his. He was glad to know that they were. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt.-rColonel Political Agent, Kuwaiti; 1 Translation of a confidential letter l :o .S -l /104, dated the 14th Rajab 1353, corresponding to the 23rd October 1934, received by His Excellency the Ruler of Iluwait, from his Lawyer, Mr.Agoob Gabriel, Basra. After Compliments, No intimation has as yet been received by the Justice of Peace, Abul-Khas^Court, of the agreement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the administration of oath on Your Excellency indirectly through the British Consul at Kuwait. I am afraid intimation will be delayed and the Court will consequently dismiss our cases which number 53. This, as Your Excellency is well aware, will cause very heavy loss of a financial and prestige nature, and of course all kinds of evil consequences will follow. In fact my whole mind is deeply stirred with anxiety, as I can find no way out, or satisfactory medicine for this alarming trouble (lit: disease). I am indeed sore perplexed and deprived of quiet sleep at night in particular because of this alarming problem, and generally over other questions from the first that affect Your Excellency. Difficulties and obstacles/have been put in my '.vay from all sources and directions* I have pondered deeply over the situation, and over the consequences that may follow, especially also of the actiai that should be taken in case no intimation shall have been received by Konday the 29th October 19 34; and last night while I was lying on bed a possible legal way out of the difficulty entered my head* It was as follows, and I hope, may suggest success. I have put my idea down on paper (see 2 Lulhaqs at tached) in the form of a special plea 1 d the Court, and am herewith forwarding^, for Your Excellency* s perusal. Should Your Excellency approve of same and agree to it, please send me the. following telegram: u Agoob, ;.awyer, Basra. I agree to the contents of your letter No.S-1/104, dated 23rd October 19 34.' . This/- 2 - This telegram should, however, reach me before Monday the 29th October, because on that day I shall leave for ^ao early in the morning to see to the abovementioned cases. Usual Ending.TRANSLATION. Ivlulhag Np.l. As my client is the Ameer of Kuwait State and Head of its Government, and as the Iraqi Government, having no Consul at Kuwait, is represented by the British Consul,there, it is impossible for my client, His Excellency the Ameer,to enter Iraq without having a passport, that must bear a visa from the British Consul in Kuwait# The British Consul, how ever, on political grounds has objected to the issue of visas on the passports of my client. His Excellency the Ameer and his staff. Hence at the moment His Excellency*s presence is impossible. The jurisprudents' decree in practice however, is that when the presence of a client to swear an oath directed to him on account of the failure of the defendant to substitute his payment, is impossible, an order should be given that payment should be made by the defendant to the plaintiff's attorney, without prejudice to the defendant's right to swear the plaintiff's when he turns up. Should the plaintiff, then, give the oath, it will be well and good. Should, on the other hand, he fail to do so, the defendant shall have the right to recover what he had paid to the plaintiff's attorney. This has been confirmed in commentary on Article 1745 of the 'Kajella' by Dr.Ali 'aider Bff. (Vol.IV P.572). Accordingly I request tht-t the defendants be ordered to pay to me, in my capacity as the plaintiff's at torney, the amount claimed plus court expenses and my fee, together with interest from the date of registration of cases and confirmation of precautionary distraint.thamsl&amp;tiok. lttlhaq. no.2. It is quite possible that the Court will not accept the above special pleading (Hulhaq Ilo.l) and will dismiss our cases. In that event I think that the best course is for Your 3xcellency to unofficially proceed by sea to Fao on Sunday evening next, so as to reach ?ao suddenly on the mornin.T of ' .onday the 29th October 1924. At 13 A.I.I# Your Excellency will appear in the Court at Fao (where I can arrange for the case to be heard) and will swear the oath required of you. This will settle the case. ' r our 'ixcellenc/ will then return to your Capital without any trouble. This is the wisest plan to save the situation and defeat our opponents. As Your Excellency knows, the Court is a house for maintaining justice and upholding the honourable Shar'a Law. In it appear Kings, Sultans and ordinary subjects side by side in veneration for the Shar'a. should Your Excellency decide to come and appear in the Fao Court, I feel sure that not one of the 'Ta'abeen' will dare come and face Your Excellency. Eence they will lose their right to ask oath from you, and judgement must be ~iven against them in default, without the actual need of Your Excellency taking oath at all, which is not allowed except in presence of the opponent. Is there any objection to Your 'Excellency's presence? It will, i feel sure, save the situation and defeat our enemies, as well as their plans which will be brought to nought. Lastly our enemies will at last come to their senses.c c \ GCII?ID}CKTI.X. No.C-282. From POLITICAL ^GENCY, KIL7AIT, The 26th October 19S4.

Third step was for Minister of Justice to refuse legalisation of Shaikh's power of attorney ^iven to lawyer (see my letter I:o. 289, of November 1st in post) and to inform latter that he could not institute proceedings against his own fellahs unless Shaikh allowed these same fellahs to institute proceedings against himself.

Point (a) is a legal argument which might have been put to Courts by Shaikh's lawyer but which only CJourt is competent to decide. His Majesty* a Embassy is not in a position to argue legal details of case Or to challenge correctness of a ruling given by Court. (b) is answered by paragraph 1 of ray Saving telegram. The Shaikh's position is unique inasmuch as he has already refused in other cases to admit jurisdiction of very Court whose aid he now seeks. Hypothetical cases cited are not analagous. In nonnal conditions paragraph 2 of your telegram would correctly summarise situation but Shaikh has already refused to accept jurisdiction of 'Iraq.

His Majesty 's Government in the Ubited Kingdom have no financial interest in the 1'ao cases &gt; whichever way they go 9 vhereas a Judgment against the Shaikh in the pending Padda ^hiyah actions might involve Hie Majesty^ Oovemment in considerable financial liability. The Iraqi Government have, in deference to representations from Ula Majenty 's Kmbaesy, agreed to postpone the hearing of the Fao cases for one month from 29th October, and 1 have aaksd them to grant a further postponement sine die. 5. There are, however, wider issues raised in the latter from the Iraq£ Oovernment which need consideration apart from their immediate bearing upon the pending land suits.

The decision that the ahaifch should be advised to refuse to accept •orvice ol judicial docuiuents eiaanating from the Iraq ^i Courts, on the grounds that he was an independent ruler, was taken as an emergency measure in order to provide a ueans of delayin^ the trial in the Iraqi Courts of the actions brought against the ohaUch contesting the validity of his title to the ^aahiyah and FaAdaghiyah gardens. Your telegram Ho. 52 of l4aroh 24th, 195 m , approved this procedure* 9fe# fact that this course of action has Buoocsaftil suspended all novement in the Courts, and that the law suits are postponed indefinitely, does not ijaply that the Iraqi uovem iacnt have accepted the contention that tike ihaikhs are not subject to the jurisdiction of their Courts.

(c) Letter No.Nil, dated the 18th October 1934 from ICemal Beg as Sanawi, Lawyer to IIr.Gabriel. 2. I should have liked to have sent these particular letters to you by the mail which is due to leave on Saturday the 3rd November, as the refusal of the Iraq B Minister of Justice to confirm the Shaikh's Power of Attorney obviously has close connection it th the demand that the Shaikh should go to Abul Khasib (Basra) and personally take oath, but I fear this will not be possible as they (letters) cannot be translated in time for me to do this, owing to other important work in hand. 3. Shortly the position is this. In the last year and a half and since the Shaikh has been obliged to employ a lawyer in Basra to defend his interests against the various- 2 - 1/ various forms of intrigues and attacks that have developed, he has had occasion to give ordinary Powers of Attorney^** to his lawyer in Basra, to enable the latter to proceed against well known Basra residents and merchants for the recovery of certain debts, as well as administer particular house and garden property owned by him. Each Power of Attorney so given dealt with the particular and specific case which it was intended to cover and no more, and contained clauses authorizing the lawyer to serve and accept legal documents. 4. The above Powers of Attorney were all registered in this Agency and later in Baghdad without difficulty, 5. On October 10th 1934, and at the time when it became necessary for the Shaikh to institute special proceedings against his recalcitrant l ? ao fellahs, the Shaikh gave his lawyer a ' General ^ Power of Attorney (referred to in the Shaikh's enclosed letter) authorizing the latter to re present him in the Administration of his exempt properties in Iraq, including such things as the collection of debts, and rents, the engaging of fresh fellahs and dismissing bad ones, the issuing of loans, the repairing of garden walls, digging of e water channels, registration of properties etc., etc., but he, the Shaikh specifically forbade the lawyer to part with or sell any properties or portions thereof, and also forbade him to accept service of any documents emanating from the Courts, in respect of his ownership or title to such properties. The Shaikh clearly (although he has mentioned nothing to me personally) acted as he did, because ^ (a) The question of ownership and title to his property A was now involved seeing that the fellaheen against whom his lawyer was proceeding (see old corres- pondence connected with the ?ao troubles generally and recently with the ''Oath' question) were the self same fellaheen who, at the instigation of- 3 - ftf3 instigation of a certain person or persons in the background gave so much trouble in 1933, and were actually challenging his, the Shaikh T s title to portions of ^his Fao Estate^ (guaranteed to him and his successors by His Majesty's Government) which they claimed as theirs, (b) He feared that if once his own tenants (instigated as he believes, by the Iraq Government)were allowed openly and in the Courts to contest his 'title*' to his property the Iraq Government would be quick to follow up their advantage, encourage other claimants (those in the Faddaghiyeh case for instance) to come out into the open and dispute his (the shaikh's) right to ownership once more / and lastly would probably themselves try and drag into the Courts the whole question of the taxation of his exempted gardens, which from His Majesty's Government's point of view would be undesirable in the extreme. NOTE. The Shaikh could not forget that a similar error of judgement had cost him his BA.SHIYEH garden, for which he was later blamed by Eis Majesty's Government, (c) ' e /as not sure whether he oould weSdop trust his lawyer, Mr.Gabriel, vrtio after all was more likely to look after his own interests before those of the Shaikh (if threatened froa certain quarters) and in the present Court case migjit actually try and pay up to the Iraq Government in order to keep on the right side of them, 6, i myself suggest the probability of a 'plot' in which the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Baghdad and Minister of Justice are the prime movers, the objective being to try and force the Shaikh to agree to accept direct service of summonses on himself through his lawyer without having recourse to the roundabout and to them dangerous route of- 4 - lu^f route of h.m 's Embassy. They clearly hope to force the Shaikh to make a false step and defend himself and his title in the local Courts by means of his lawyer, instead of with the assistance of His Majesty's Government, 7. I further suggest that the recent order of the Basra Court, calling upon the . haikh to take a certain oath gave the Iraq Government the opportunity they sought, for we see the Ilinister of Forei^i Affairs acting in collaboration with the Ilinister of /ustice, on the one hand ordering the Shaikh's lawyer to inform the Shaikh direct that he must appear in person to swear oath before the Abul IQiasib Court by.the 2 9th October, on pain of losing his cases against 53 fellahs (here is the eiT^ort to short circuit H.Li's Embassy), while on the other hand, and to make the Shaikh's discomfiture doubly sure we see the Minister of Justice deliberately refusing to legalize the Shaikh's General Power of attorney, authorizing his lawyer to proceed against his tenants, on the excuse that the said Power of Attorney does not authorize the lawyer to accept service of le^al documents on behali' of his master, (here is the effort to get the Shaikh to himself defend his title to his property, and dispense with the assist nee of 'is Majesty's Government). 8. In other words the Iraq Governnent as good as says to the Shaikh 'Unless you allow your ?ao fellahs to dispute 'your title to your ?ao istates (held by you 'for over 100 years and guaranteed to you by you 'His I'ajesty's jovemiient) we will not alloT^to 'proceed against any of them for the recovery 'of money advances, or 'dates' due to you as 'landlord'. 9. Ithough I have not, I fe?r, marshalled my facts . as clearly as I might have, I think I have said enough to enable/to enable you to drew the attention of the Ambassador at Baghdad to what a; pears to be a neat and clever plot to panic the Shaikh into making a false move, as well as place T 'is !Iajesty T s Grovernment in a false position. 10.

This refusal of the inistry of Justice to confirm the said Power of Attorney will assuredly deprive my Acent of all power to protect my rights in any legal way as he states in his abovementioned letter.

The non- confirmation of this power of attorney means that my hands will be restrained by the shackles of the Law, and that I shall in no way be able to defend your ixcellency 's rights.

I would, therefore, ask that your Excellency kindly take necessary steps to (a) obtain the confirae.tion of the 1 ministry of Justice to the said power of attorney, and (b) :et the said Ministry, by an order of the Ministry for foreign Affairs, to agree to the administration o the oath on your Excellency indirectly, and to notify this to the Court of Abul Khasib, before Monday the 29th October 1934. Failing the above your Excellency's rights will no doubt be lost, with the still worse consequence that our opponents will be encouraged to further outrage, and will refuse to hand over the just rights of your Excellency.

They have refrained from touching upon question of jurisdiction and have never admitted even tacitly Shaikhs claim to immunity from process (see Ogi Ivb -Forbes 1 despatch 630 of 27th October, paragraph 4). On the contrary I am informed that whatever the status of the shaikh as a foreign ruler may be the Iraq Courts would not admit immunity in cases arising out of title of immovable property in Iraq. His Majesty's Government have hitherto merely transmitted Shaikh's if claim that as independent ruler he is not subject to jurisdiction of Iraq Courts• They have not given official support to it. If argument is to be used it would necessitate (^putting forward; his claim in an official communication and to giving detailed reasons for supporting it.

As regards (c) ^janexure I, you will notice that 1 have been able to obtain frcm the Shaikh and give the names of all the 'HAUZES' or individual garden holdings, making up the Loitaawa* ah, Taddaghiyeh and jao Estates, but have given none in the case of the small gardens, J'arhaniyeh holdings. You will notice also that only in the case of the ^addaghiyeh' have I given the official ] umbers of the various Tapu oanads under which that property is held. The bhaikh indeed was very loath to letting me have unless he did so the .jnbassador would perhaps have difficulty in carrying through his secret negotiations to a successful conclusion with the Iraq Cxovernment, regarding the 'addaghiyeh, whidb. were now in progress. 4. .... rs ar s ipplyin copies of actual Tapu papars in his possession, or giving copies of oanads etc., e Shaikh quite rightly remarked that this would be a most lengthy and laborious process and definitely gave me to understand that he could not undertake it. At the sai^e time he pointed out that every sin :le Tapu Sanad possessed by him was registered in the Tapu Department in Basra and that these could at any time be scrutinized by a representative of the Embassy on payment of a small fee, or copies easi-o ^e taken if considered necessary. Further that as The Jubass; 8/ Baghdad v/ere only immediately concerned in settling the Faddaghiyeh question he could not see that documents concerning his title to other Istates in Iraq, cane into the picture at all. - s these arguments were unanswerable and as I saw that the Shaikh was nervous in the extreme about parting with copies or data connected with his other e exempt properties, I did not press the point.5. In supplying me with the particulars set forth in ..nnexure No.I. and especially the information connected v/ith the ^liAUZ' or XZ^N n holdings, the ohaikh made me give my word of honour that no part of the information so given would be passed to the Iraq Govemment, but only that which related to the ^adda^hiyeh. I readily ::ave this, in view of is llajesty's Oovernment r s telegram ! 0.2296 and paragraph 3. 6. I'he shaikh indeed wanted ne to promise that nothing of what he had told me would be communicated even to H.I^s Jmbassy at Baghdad, but I think I convinced him of the impracticability of this request. I,however, comforted him by assuring him that the liabassy would without doubt be told of my promise to him and would of course observe secrecy. 7. In this connection I may mention that throughout the four difficult discussions which I had, the Shaikh kept on bringing the conversation round to the fact that he was quite positive that His Ilajesty^ G-overnment * s latest request for particulars as to holdings, title etc., had all originated from the Iraq Government, and that the latter had cunningly persuaded the iunbassador to pass it on as coming from himself. In proof of this he, the Shaikh, declared that he had actually been warned from Baghdad that he would shortly be asked to supply information which was considered of vital importance by the Iraq Government and which would eventually pass into their hands and be used to prosecute the coming attack on his ft title f . Could he be blamed therefore if he felt alarmed and nervous about supplying material, which might fall into the enemy r s hands to his undoing. S. I repeat below, with great diffidence and of course with full apology, as near as I can possibly remember them, some of the actual words used by the Shaikh, as I feel no useful purpose can be served by my keeping them back:- Tt 7hat were the facts -'His Ilajesty's Government * s. Tt Government * s pledge to his grandfather, of 1914 Tt his children for ever, and also promised exemption from T, t xation for ever. Could issue be more simple, r, had happened? Iraq had deliberately taxed these 'properties for the third year in succession, and ,r by every form of pressure and underhanc intrigue was ''actually now preparing to challenge his actual title to 'the larjest of them, with a vier; to dispossessing 'him. 1 or the last four years he ha: : been fighting 'the iabassy, who lived not like himself at a distance, 'but ri-^ht in the heart of the enemy 1 s capital, was 'not doing all the fighting for him. London he knew was 'sympathetic, and was helping, but he had a right to 'side, but alas the reverse seemed to be the case, and 'he saw that whether ''date gardens'' ot 'smuggling* were ' Embassy* s eyes, iror could he fail to see that the 'clever Iraq Politicians, by continually acvancing fresh 'legal points and quibbles, were slowly leading the Embassy into wondering whether he actually had any rights 'at all, surely the solemn promise of Great Britain 'to Mubarrk ought to be the only thing that lettered', from the above it will be seen, . fear, that the ohaikh has ot well into his head, the unfortunate and wholly unjustifiable idea that the Embassy is helping the Iraq Government a :ainst hiu, This indeed s-aems to have been a development of the last few months (possibly as a result of the abortive smuggling conference of last .u^ust). ! :hin s being as they are I would earnestly ask whether it coulc not be arranged for :jr,-.lexander, or some other official from the ^uaassy to run down here to Iluwait and stop a few days with me, I consider it of importance to try and remove these wrong ideas and suspicions from the shaikh's mind, and could arrange for whoever- 5 - arrange for whoever came down to have a good heart to heart talk with him* I feel sure nothing but good would come of the visit. I remember how very pleased the Shaikh was last year when I told him that Ilr.Nihill hoped to come down and see him. Unfortunately the visit fell through. 10. I have made the above suggestion as I feel considerable alarm at the growing bitterness of the Shaikh. Today he thinks the imbassy is not only against him, but v/ork- ing with the Iraqis, which means to him that they are now actively assisting in the Iraqis efforts to tax him,^ take his gardens away from him. Tomorrow it may quite well be the Residents or my turn. hat I do not want to see is the ...haikh gradually drifting over towards :in -.,aud, a not impossible contingency. Indeed the latter may even now be trying to turn the .Shaikh* s hatred for Iraq and the latter* s persecution of Kuwait to account . One must not forget that Bin Saud is already working for some sort of entente with the Arab States of the Gulf, and Shaikh Hafith 'fahba himself arrives in Kuwait from London in December.

It of course never paid taxes during the British occupation of Iraq.Oikv (-1 *11.

The writer has compiled the note from a series of recent conversations which he has had with the Ghaikh, members of the Al oubah ,? , domiciled in 1'uwait and Basra, and from notables and leading merchants of Kuwait, ...ubair and Basra. ' ot the least interesting of his informants has been 1C.3. Ilulla .aleh, who was ecretary to shaikhs Lubarak, Jabir and Salim and is to-day the ^fidus achates', adviser and secretary to the present ruler. !• (a) Gardens Tt A ,f and ''B' as has been pointed out frequently .uring the last 5 years by the writer, are held under ^Tapu oanad rt , and as such are fully registered in the Tapu Departments Office at Basra. (b) Gardens ,r C n and 'D' are not on the other hand re gistered in Tapu, but as will be seen from ^nnexure I (accompanying this), are held under tT ^enads' ? and ' ahbiyeh'* documents respectively, that is to say ^Deed of Purchase' and 'Deed of lift' - both of which are recormized by the Gheri T a Law of Islam. (c) Garden TT J' I do not propose to discuss at all, seeing that it was ^iven by -haikh I.ubarak to his daughter, Jharifa when she married shaikh i.aud al Jar rah al Subah of ICut al jain Shatt al Arab, during the former's lifetime, and-^ated and the present ohaikh of Kuwait has no actual interest in same. Nevertheless as will be seen from Annexure I, it is one of the Gardens which His llajesty^ Grovernuent included in their 1914 'ledge, and it must still be considered exempt li}? from Iraq Taxation. 2. ^s Gardens 'C' have been held for over 60 years, and Garden tt D M for over 100 years respectively by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and as Shaikh Llubarak felt very secure in his title and rights over them he did not trouble to take out Tapu Papers during the Turkish regime. He had experienced so much difficulty with various ./alis and I.utasarrifs over Gardens n A ?t and 'B' and had spent so much in bribes in his efforts to register them under Tapu that he thought it better to leave well alone. He was further encouraged to come to this decision by the chaotic condition existing in the Basra Liwa in the years immediately preceding the Great 7ar, when lack of Government control was the order of the day, and Government 'Mamurs' officials scarcely dared proceed down river for fear of being shot by the tribes. 2. The Turkish Government for their part n ever tried to upset Shaikh Lubarak 's claims to 'C' and ' r D tT and were entirely satisfied so long as Mubarak paid them revenue regularly. This lubarak took care to do upto the coming of the English in 1914. In proof of this the present Shaikh holds and can produce Turkish Revenue receipts for many years of t xation paid, which in themselves constitute power ful proof that the A1 Subah were recognized as the rightful owners by the Turks. 4. That the Jao Estates in particular were recognized by the Turks as forming part of the ^1 Subah lands, is further proved by the fact that, in an important inheritance case which arose between the members of the A1 Subah family in . which several distant branches were concerned, the n Saniya Department 1 acting under direct telegraphic orders of the Of Augustus ^^4 AL , AALI (Sultan Abdul Hamid himself) sat on, adjudicated the matter, and gave written decision. This document whichwhich incidentally gave n ao to 'Llubarak and those members of the A1 3ubah residing in Kuwait was issued officially under date 14th Fajairan 1S20. • • 1 :ere are today several hundreds of persons owning garden property in Iraq, between Kurna and Tao, who are holding their gardens by virtue of ^Senads*' (deeds of purchase only, who like I .Iubarak never thought it worth while to take out Tapu Deeds• His Majesty's G-overnment can easily verify the truth of this. So wide spread was the practice that it became necessary for Sir Eenry Dobbs when acting Revenue Commissioner, .Jasra, to call upon garden owners not possessing /apu papers to take such papers out and register their gardens. Jhis was done by - reclamation under the authority of the then Army Commander. Actually only about 50 % persons took the trouble to register, while 50 % including the A1 Subah did not. The A1 Subah in the case of 'D', ?ao, in particular indeed found themselves f^t5ed with almost insuperable difficulties, and decided to leave well alone until such time as the .ar ended and they could approach His Majesty's Government for guidance. Chief of these difficulties was the fact that their decendants had grown to over 200 in number (men, women and children), and it would have been a most difficult, if not an impossible operation, to have taken out papers in respect of the various and many names existing, let alone attempt to divide and allocate actual shares in- the estate according to the Jheria Law rules. 6. Moreover from earliest times it had been an axiom in the policy of the various Rulers of Kuwait, to themselves manage, for internal political reasons, the Fao Estate on behalf of the family as a whole and pay out monthly salaries to individuals instead. This gave them that control over the various members and branches of the family which is so necessary in an Eastern Kingdom, as it enabled the Rulers to keep the family united in the face of pressure and dangerX danger from without, For instance, Bin Saud in his various efforts to acquire control of Kuwait has before now tried to sow dissension among the ill Subah but has failed, simply because the ohaikh controlled the 7ao family's garden shares. 7. The Iraq Government fully recognize this, and believe that the 1 ao Estates are in consequence the 'Achilles heel ?t of the Shaikhs of Kuwait. 8. ':ence there is every reason to suppose that their stirring up in 1953 and 1934 of the ?ao fellahs to refuse to pay the Shaikh his landlords rental is part of a deep laid plot to attack this 'Achillas heel'. To be successful however they (the Iraq Government) knew that they must so arrange that the Shaikh should accept service of judicial documents against himself in respect of his exempted gardens, in order to give the necessary chance to his tenants to contest in the Courts his title to o.vnership of this Fao property. They also knew that this was against the considered wishes and plans of His Majesty's Government, but they hoped to p;et the Shaikh into making a false step, by threatening him mth general rebellion of his Fao fellahs, and so with a loss of many thousands of pounds of rentals. 9. ere once they, the fellahs, to be allowed to put the Shaikh into Court, it is the considered view of the Shaikh and the writer, that they would proceed as follows (all the time aided and instructed by the Iraq Government): (a) They would call upon the Shaikh to produce Tapu papers (which he has not got). (b) They would say that his '/ahbiyeh' papers only gave him control of half his present estates. That the other half was Government land because it has been recovered from the sea. (c) If the Shaikh vron his case as he possibly might do (but this is not certain with a hostile Iraq Government behind the Courts) they, the fellahs, would/would then object to the Shaikh of Kuwait being their actual landlord on the ground that he was a tyrant ahd bad absentee landlord. They would pray the Iraq Courts to force the Shaikh to divide the whole property among the 200 members of the A1 Subah that exist, and would ask for an order that new Tapu papers be issued in respect of such persons. (d) The &gt;ourts backed by the Iraq Government would of course support the fellahs, and so the Political .ower of the i haikh of Kuwait over the various members of his family would go for ever. (e) The Iraq Government would nyt be able to deal with th^is newly formed group of small A1 Subah holdings as they liked, as they would no longer have an awkward Shaikh of Kuwait, backed by His Majesty's Government, to deal with. (f) The final and last step towards the accomplishment of their purpose would be for the Iraq Government to intrigue with the various members of the A1 Subah in Kuwait itself, persuade each holder in the other exempt Estates i.e. ?I B ,, Faddaghiyeh and 'A' Ivutaawa, of the advantages of having his own particular garden to himself and of taking out separate Taou papers and the discomfiture of the Shaikh would be complete. (g) -ne end would be that the -raq Government would persuade the members oi' the Subah, all now separate ly owning their small gardens, to petition that Kuwait form part of Iraq. The Iraq Government would support this request and the independent State of Kuwait would disappear, much in the same way as did the great 'baadun' Sheikhdom of the Muntafik on the Euphrates which was broken up by the Turks, oy this very method of sowing discord among the junior members of the JL .'Jaadun ?T , and encoura' ing10. encouraging them to ask that their shares in the ancestral property be given to them under Tapu Deed, bo would History repeat itself. .lie above suggestions are not fanciful ideas, but I believe, are sober possibilities for it should never be iorgotten that the present rulers in Iraq were all brought up in the 1 urkish School, and know exactly how to proceed towards their objectives. : ;ost of them were alive and held official positions in Iraq when the Turks tried to force Kuwait to accept their rule in Ghaikh Mubarak*« reign (1907 to 1914). They are fully aware of the good cards that exist and were held by the Turks, and also know exactly what mistakes they (Turks) he de at the time. They know that the Great far saved ICuwait, but also realize that the urks antagonized Is ''ajesty's Government, who had taken up the cudgels on behalf of ohaikh Kubarak and Kuwait. This -uat';er mistake, the3^ realize, must on no account be a -ain comr.iitted by the xew Iraq State, hence deeper and more cunning methoas must be employed, e• g. the breaking up of Kuwait estates into small holdings, getting individual members of the family on their side, and finally gettin- to petition that Kuwait be placed under Iraq control 11. It is no accident that ith the programme outlined in para (7) above, Kuwait should to-day be faced with such things as rT omu:^lin£ rT pressure, private attacks on the 'addaghiyeh and 'ashiyeh ^states, tryin- to confuse issues by challenging validity of documents, with TisKajesty's Tovernment, and insistence that exempt gardens pay Taxes. These attacks are all part and parcel of the process of beating down resistence and s lov/in • the shaikh the futility of not coming into the Iraqi fold. No doubt the Iraq Government has her or.-n methods of letting the Shaikh know that if he were to cease kicking aflinst the pricks, ^ave up relying on is -ajesty T s Government's su iport, and would surrendersurrender gracefully, then they the Iraq Government would offer most generous terms. In the same way, and with promises of the same sort, did Bin Laud tackle the Idrissi, rot control of -.sir. 12. There are even indications today, though definite proof has not come to light yet, that the Iraq Government has already got hold of certain senior members of the Al Subah family (names known) and are trying to get them to propagand for them in the heart of ' uwait itself. The line taken being something as follows: ' /hat has 'is Majesty*s Government done for you in ' T any more? She is a broken reed and dare not threaten 'Iraq, or force her to honour her 191-1 pledges. _s 'for Bin baud's pressure, she fears the latter like 'she does Iraq, and has done nothing to help remove 'the Blockade of 10 years duration, nor does she 'intend to do anything. Join Iraq and you will see 'how well your interests will be looked after rT . 13. The programme outlined above deals only with what the writer thinks are the Iraq Governments plans and has not of course taken into account lis I.ajesty's Government's reactions, but then Iraq are not likely to be worried by this, filled as thsy are vrith an overweanini; confidence in themselves and their cowers of beinr able to get round any objections or awkward ruestions on the part of 'is Majesty's Government. 14. It might be asked what today are (a) The Shaikh's views, and (b) His people*s reactions to Iraq's latest pressure on Ijuwait. ..s re ;ards (• ) : The haikh continues to show an outward ly brave front, and to the members of his family and leading notables of Kuwait, is never tired of reiterating his firm belief that His liajesty's Government will honour all their obligations and pledges of.1914. In conversation with the- 8 - nj with the writer, however, and especially has this been the case sins e the latter returned from England last October (1934), the shaikh has shown unuistakable signs of nervousness and panic, and there can be no doubt that he is beginning to fear that is Majesty*s G-overnment may desert him. lie most unfortunately has got it well into his head that Englishmen in Baghdad are strongly backing Iraq both in the matter of his Gardens and where smuggling questions are concerned. The writer has of course taken every step possible to dispel these foolish ideas, and is continuing to do steadily and purposefully. The ;haikh sticks to his guns however and says that he is fully aware that English officials in Baghdad are of course upright and honest of gentlemen, who would never dream of purposely doing a dishonourable act, but that this very honesty of purpose is their weakness, for they cannot credit the Iraqi politician with acting in a manner different from what they themselves would do / nor can they see when he is deceiving them. The Shaikh has again and.again harped on this particular point, and the writer has again and again pointed out the unfairness not to say impropriety of his holding i uch views. The Jhaikhs only re )ly is, ''Colonel Dickson, I know things which you do not. I am an Arab and know what my fellow _rabs are thinking of in Iraq, you do not', (b) The people of Kuwait seem to feel that their haikh is fighting a losing battle, and sense the magnitude of the danger, for do not the haikh T s Date Gardens provide thousands of people with food, and do not the Shaikh's lo?/ Customs make living cheap for the thousands of people living on the borderland of starvation. They today openly enquire why it is that the English are failing their 3haikh, as they would not have done some years back. Their faith fortunately remains firm in the efforts of the British Political Agent to put things right. They see him constantly going and coming from the shaikh'sShaikh's ralace, and believe he is working out some plan to save Kuwait. Nevertheless the hostile feeling against Iraq and to a lesser extent against the English has never beei. so pronounced as it is today. This, one understands, worked itsel- up to fever heat after the break up of the ''Smuggling Conference'' held in the Summer. Then the writer returned from leave he was most disagreeably surprise., to see how strong this feeling had grown. He can best convey the state of affairs by the following two stories:- (a) Two edouin women stopped him recently in the streets and one of them holding out her baby, cried out: 'We hate you Inglese and do not want you in Kuwait, all but yourself Abu ..aud. The English are trying to rob our Shaikh and starve our children. ,7e know you to be our friend and will not let them starve us, but may G-od curse the rest of the Inglese' • U - Jdu Saud is the Bedouin name for the writer.) (b) An old Ilutairi Shaikh came in from TIafar al Batin to see the writer, and in course of conversation said, ^'/e hear in the desert that you English are trying to sell Kuwait to the Northern Kaffirs (Iraqis) and that two high Iraqi officers were recently brought here by an important .englishman, to settle the deal (A reference to the smuggling conference): But God in His mercy did not allow it and gave Ahmad wisdom to refuse. But by God, if you try to do such a thing again, our master. Bin Saud, will ccme to the help of Ahmad, 7e Bedouin will not allow you English to sell uwait, No, by God, we won't' The above stories are indeed significant. Political agency, Kuwait.

The Shaikh from the very beginning of the agrarian troubles at n ao endeavoured by every means in his power to keep Eis Majesty's c -ovemment au fait with every move in the game, and the shaikh's information as it came in was without delay passed on to His Liajesty's 'ilmbassy through you.

I was as you will see faced with the awkward difficulty of trying to convey to you the fact that not only had the Sheikh more than ever got it firmly fixed in his head that the British Embassy were against him in the matter of his date gardens, smuggling, etc., but that clever Iraqi politicians were leading the :3mbassy rt by the nose' and making them ask for important documents from him, which would be passed on and would enable them to launch their next attacK on him this time against his / 'title' to his Fao estates. 3. Unless therefore I brought out all the above facts I felt I could not satisfactorily explain why the Sheikh was so strong ly averse to parting with detailed information regarding his gardens, or with sending copies of deeds and sanads he had in his possession, to the Embassy. 4. as a matter of fact the list of the 'Hauzes' which I managed to get out of the ^heikh with great difficulty together with the official numbers of his Faddaghiyeh Tapu deeds, will 1 think, be all that the Embassy will re uire. I sincerely hope that they will. 5. Of course I realize that I ought not to say things in a despatch reflecting on our Embassy in Baghdad. That is why I am not happy about my despatch.

The Sheikh is in difficult mood, these days, I fear. ihe way in which the smuggling conference of last august was rushed through reacted particularly badly on him, and we must never forget that he receives long letters regularly from friends dm high places in Baghdad, warning him against this and that likely move. 7. I do not mind his being against the - L raqis but I dort't like his getting ideas into his head where we English are concerned that is why I suggested that Alexander come down and talk to the Sheikh.

Have •Iraq Government yet agreed to indefinite postponement of l ?ao cases, see Ogilvie- Forbes* telegram lio. 28 to Bushire ? if not you should at once endeavour to get them to do so, postponement beyond 29th November being, in any case, essential. Meanwhile it appears useless to pursue question of jurisdiction on present legalistic lines. 10 sit ion is that both late and present King of •Iraq undertook to ensure that ohaikh's possession of his date gardens would not be disturbed and means of giving prac- -tical effect to these undertakings are being actively pursued. These undertakings presumably indicate desire 00 assist shaikh and justify assumption that •Iraq Govern- -ment do not wish to suggest( ?assist) elements in •Iraq who are endeavouring to disturb his possession. But recent attitude of •Iraqi Ministry of Justice, particularly as regards Fao cases, is entirely inconsistent with royal undertakings and can oi.ly be explained by desire to make matters as difficult as possible for the bhaikh as plain- -tiff, in order to force him to admit jurisdiction of 1 Iraqi2. • Irac^i Jourta as defendant* I therefore consider that means must be found to make ^raq Government face realities of position# while first necessity i3 to secure postponement of iteo cases, you should also take an early opportunity of representing to 'Iraq Government above view of situation and of making it clear that His MaJesty•s Government cannot believe that policy of •Iraq Government in this matter has completely changed and that assurances of two Kings of •Iraq are now to be taken as repudiated as might be inferred from ifari Said kasha's note of 21st October# Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Copy forwaeaed to r.^.Kuwait under . .L .Mo.1089 -3 of 24 /11 /34.

Jourt has already v/ithdrawn order for appearance of Shaikh but this does not advance Fao cases as 'Iraq Government will not fo rv/ard documents for administration of oath unless Shaikh agrees to accept service of all pending judicial documents. This seems to be their only motive and their refusal to con- -firm power of attorney referred to in your paragraph 2 is only another step in the same direction. There is no attack upon his status as an independent ruler. Your paragraph 3. It has not been suggested that Shaikh's status is in any doubt or that it has lacked official support from His Majesty'i Government. The comment in my telegram had referred only to his claim to immunity of jurisdiction because he is an independent ruler. I am satisfied that the beat we can do in the resent circumstances is to secure post- -ponement of these cases until Faddaghiyeh case is out of the way.

The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ.In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohamerrah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1. The correspondence also discusses in detail a court case in the Iraqi courts regarding the land owned by Shaikh Aḥmad and the Al Sabah family.The correspondence discusses attacks on Shaikh Aḥmad's fellaheen (agricultural workers) in Iraq by other fellaheen on the land and contains a translation of a letter outlining the details of these attacks sent from Shaikh Aḥmad to the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Harold Richard Patrick Dickson (folio 32).A complete list of the date garden properties in Iraq which were in possession of Shaikh Mubārak in 1914 (and included in the British Government's pledge of that year) is contained in the file on folios 161-171.The file also contains correspondence regarding whether or not Shaikh Aḥmad should attend the trial in Iraq in person, concerns about his growing frustration with the British Government's perceived inability to resolve the dispute and his belief that they were siding with the Iraqi government against him.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
