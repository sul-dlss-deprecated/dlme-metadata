Dated i9th and reed. 20th June 1919• Please refer to oorreapondenoe enaing witu your telegram Ko. 6414 dated 8th instant. The whole question has been under the oarefu conai- deration of H.M 'e Sovernnent. It is. speaking generally, our polioy to avoid getting entangled in the rolitios of Central Arabia and to reduce to a minimum our coamitt-aents there and elsewhere. 'o the polioy of setting up one Chief against another (as su-estea in telegram No. 937 dated 7th instant from high Commissioner Cairo) and attempting to establis /i a e oowei amoni,. Chi .fs in Central Arabia, we should be altogether opposed. W* must, however, judge particular cases on their merits and for the following reaeore we think it wo . •^ impracticable for us to be disinterested in the affairs of BIH BAJSHID. (1) The influenc# BIH RA3HID exercises extends up -o Haiti of Iraq. (2) The pilgrim route to Holy Places from Iraq is control- led lay him. f ?or above reasone we accept in principle proposition. (!) That it is desirable, in order to make EIK RASHID reapect our borders and keep open the route for pilgriw. to enter into relations with him to the extent of subsidi- zing him. (2) Our relations with him should be conducted not through the High Cofflmiesioner. Cairo, but through Civil CommiesioneJ Baghdad. 'aximum of subsidy mentioned in your telegram ;:o.6668 of 17th May 1919 seems altogether excessive and should be n a* • «r.»«+4nff of the Eastern Committ«&lt; fixed on peace scale. At a meeting o- the sum of £500/- was mentioned. Beforec/ T - 2 - Before finally settling what payment should be made I would like to know what subsidy he was in reoeipt of before the war. In Tiew of the enmity which exists between BIN SAUD and BIN RASEID, it might be desirable, pending the completion of Mr. Philby^s oaeaion which is being dealt witn separately - to defer ertering into negotiations with uIN RAShlD.

Dated 17th ( received IBth ) April 1920 My telegram of ISth April 4524. It appears that murder of Saud bin Rashid was due solely to family jealousies and was not, instigated from outside. G3neral opinion appears to be that event will greatly strengthen position of Bin Saud in Central Arabia. Present Amir Abdullah Ibn Mitaab is a ( youth ) of t^rfeen on whose behalf his geeat uncle Ibn Ajil is acting. Latter is aaid to be disliked by tribesmen and townsmen alike and arrangement is not likely jbo last. -5 It is considered probable that Feisal bin Hamud bin C Obeid oldest representative of the youngest branchy house, long a refugee in Riyadh^will be put up by Bin Saud as Amir of Shammar.* Addressed India Office, repeated Simla, Cairo, Koweit, Bahrein Buehire. 000-TqIngram From - Political, Bahrain, i'o - Givoorn, Baghdad.

I do not as yet know the actual details of the murder, but Amir Aodullah bin Uatab A1 Abdul Aziz Al Rashid has succeeded to the Amirate. This man is of a young age, being only 11 (eleven) years old. They(the murderers) do not feel ashamed of this disfraoeful conduct from the lik^ of which may God preserve me* The present Amir is incompetent and does not possess the necess ary qualifications for administration and management of affAirs; xhe Amirate is now in thy hands of same stupid individuals of thy Al Sabhan tribe and the slaves of the assassinated Amir* i 1 received a letter from them begging me t o make peace and con clude a treaty with them. 1 wrote a reply, and embodied certain conditions to be complied with before I would have anything to do with them. This was to the effect that I would neither make peace nor conclude a treaty except in the presence of the lead ing i^ii|ii]i jiii notables of the t own of Mail and the shaikhs of the tribe of flhammar. As your honour is well aware, 1 do not trust these people because of their false promises and untrustworthy attitude towards alliances and friendships in general* Most probably, they will give themselvtj entirely over to the Sharif and his friends, as I have said above I do not accept their solemn promises, except under the guarantee of competent men of Mail and the Meadmen of Shammar, and if they do not agree, God, is both our guardian and theirs as well* I desired to report this to your honour,.and wouldfurther desire It, to be conveyed to the Hor^ble Civil Commisaioner in Mesopotamia. I hope, you will please me with the good news of your health and welfare and will be kind enough to convey my best respects to the aforesaid Hobble gentleman.
