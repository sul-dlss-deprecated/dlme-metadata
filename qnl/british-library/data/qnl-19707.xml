As it was not known where these 21 persons had been taken it was thought probable that they were taken to the Batinah coast and salahdin was accordingly given letters by the Local Government to the Walis of BarkR-h and suwaiq - Galahdin after a few days returned and stated that his people were at Karwar in Persian i^ekran and had not been taken to the Batinah coast. Here the matter rested. in March Salahdin again came and reported that out of the 21 persons 4 had been taken to Masnaah by one Hasan Shah Baluch of Bft -Aba Ali* He was given a letter to the Wali of Masnaah. In June Ali Eaksh ^rother of Salahdin came and repotted that his 21 relatives were at Sarmad with one Mahomed Dhawar Baluch slave broker. He was taken to the Mahkamah but as no reply to the former letters had been brought from the Walis of Masnaah and Suwaiq they did not give him any letter(2) letter this time - Since then neither Salahdin nor Ali Bahsh has appeared and the matter has remained pending. If however Salahdin comes to Muscat this office will take up the matter again with the Local Government. 1AAJ OH, political Agent &amp; H« B-M* s Consul, MUSCAT* A»J•deC•\ V To cf 1924» British Agency &amp; Consulate, Muscat, the 14th Cctcher 1924.

It belongs to the Shaikhs of other tribes such as the Al-Nealm and Al-bu-Shamla and these tribesmen have rot their own Shaikhs on whom the Shaikh of Ahu Dhabi has no authority. He has only a few villages In Bralmi district but t^ese are far away from the said tribes* homes. The late Shaikh Zaid bin Khallfah was an experienced governor and was feared and In consequence these tribes had some consideration for him whenever he addressed them on such matters. After his death when thinrs devolved to his children affairs also changed. The first Governor was Shaikh Hamdan who was killed by his brother ; the present Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, For this act of fratricide the tribesmen do not respect him nor they pay attention to his words. Moreover after this Shaikhs flp-htinp' with the Al-Durua* (about which T have sent you a ^enort under x my letter No.342 dated 25th September 1924) in which he did not pet victory he lost his authority and tribesmen look on him with i contempt. For these reasons T do not think that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi can recover the men from Bralmi. v y opinion, however. Is that In case you approve. Sayid Hamad bin Faisal of Sohar may be asked for this as he has relations with the Shaikhs of the above^entloned tribes also with the Shaikh of 3enl Ka'ab and If he were to take some measures in this resnect he can recover the men from Bralmi,F rom To Wr pCRBS'om.

' ^ The P.A.Muscat in his first report to us relating to the kidnapping and selling into slavery of certain relatives of Salahdin 'bin Kamal stated that Salahdin had recorded a statement giving the number of his missing relatives as 21. Apparently there v/as some douht here as to the accuracy of this number for in our letter dated the 25th Novr. 1924 to the P .A .Shargah asking him to make enquiries as to the whereabouts of Salahdin•s missing relatives we quoted the number as being about 21. In Octr. 1926, however, Jan Muhammad, brother-in-law of Salahdin in a statement recorded at this Residency definiljLy states that 25 persons - all related to himself and Salahdin - were kidnapped. As he follows up his statement with full details as to their names, relationship and probable whereabouts there is now little doubt that the number is 25 not 21. Of this number 2 i.e, Janu and Abdul have since died and 7 others i.e., Ashraf, Fatimah, Lai Khatun, Mahtab, M^ah Khatun, Takqri and Waluk have been liberated and restored to their relatives.

Within the contents of files 5/194, 5/195 I, 179 III and 5/169 II, the correspondence has been ordered chronologically, from the earliest at the front to the latest at the rear. Files 5/194 and 5/195 I deal with a single specific case of slavery, and all correspondence within each relates to these cases. The contents of files 179 III, 169 II and 104 IV are individual slavery or manumission cases. 179 III contains one case, 169 II three cases (contents page on folio 117), and 5/104 IV three cases (contents page on folio 140). The cases in 169 II are ordered chronologically; those compiled in 5/104 IV are not in chronological order.</extent><extent>Foliation: The volume is foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover with circled numbers in the top-right corner of each front-facing page. There is evidence on some pages of an earlier foliation system using uncircled numbers.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains miscellaneous slave trade correspondence, distilled from a number of original subject files, covering a disparate range of slavery related from a four-decade period.The contents of the original subject file 5/194 I relate to an incident in 1924 in which twenty-five members of the same family (the figure is initially stated as being 21) are kidnapped from Baluchistan, and sold and distributed on the Arabian Peninsula. The correspondence in the file relates to two men who are relatives of the family members, who spend several years trying to trace their relatives. In November 1925, the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux) wrote to the Residency Agent at Sharjah (‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif) requesting his help in tracing family members in the region, it being understood that two were in Dubai, were in Abu Dhabi, and a further two in Umm al-Qaywayn (folio 29). Prideaux wrote to the Shaikhs of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Umm al-Qaywayn to request their help in each case. In March 1928, ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif wrote to the Political Resident (now Lieutenant-Colonel Lionel Haworth) stating that he had managed to retrieve two of the relatives in Dubai (folios 70-73). In January 1931 he wrote to state that another one of the relatives had been retrieved, also from Dubai, and given a manumission certificate (folios 81-85);Correspondence formerly contained in the original file 5/104 IV relating to Samuel Zwemer of the Theological Seminary in New Jersey, requesting the help of the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle) in 1936, in locating the papers of a colleague of his, one William Solomon, who was manumitted from slavery by the Muscat Political Agent in 1896. In response to Zwemer’s request, the British Consulate General wrote to Zwemer, stating that all papers in Muscat dated prior to 1909 had been destroyed. This case was directly related to correspondence in ‘5/104 II, III – Miscellaneous slave trade correspondence’ (IOR/R/15/1/202, folios 67-72) in which Samuel Zwemer made the same request two years previously;Subject 4 of file 5/104 IV relates to the manumission of a slave at Bushire in 1906. The slave’s statement (folio 159) being the earliest of its type found in the Bushire Residency files.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000b0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
