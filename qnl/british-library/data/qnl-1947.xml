Memorandum &gt; Though Squadron-Leader Coates has been appointed Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, and has now been in residence for some time, I find that I as Political Agent still receive frequent requests to provide funds for the Royal Air Force Works Supervisor here, and indeed for the Air Liaison Officer^ ”Public Account 1 * which he has opened with the Eastern Bank. 2* Presumably this is due to a misconception that a branch of the Indian Treasury exists in Bahrain. Although the Political Agent is designated Treasury Officer, there is in fact no currency chest or treasury, and the Political Agent at present actually obtains his funds by indenting on the surplus receipts of the Post Office here* It is anticipated that the Post Office will move in the near future from the Agency compound to the centre of the town, and when that occurs the present practice by which the Political Agent obtains his funds will cease. The Political Agent will then have no more than an account with the Eastern Bank and will in fact be in identically the same situation as the Air Liaison Officer. 3* In these circumstances I request that arrangements may be made for the Air Liaison Officers account with the Eastern Bank to be credited direct by you with all funds necessary for the operation of his own office and for meeting the cost of other Royal Air Force activities in Bahrain including the Works and Building Branch.

Sorry to miss you Yours ever, sd. J*.h.8.lys8en#aopy. Air Headquarters, British forces in Iraq, Habfcaniya - Ireq. 30th July 193B. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the question of supplying funds for the Royal Air Force at Bahrain and to forward herewith V - ■ fv M' for your consideration a copy of a letter Ho*981»4/20 of 2&gt;rd July that I have received from the Political Agent there. 2. For the purpose of convenience it may be as well to reiterate briefly certain points connected with the above subject. You will remember that arrangements were made in 1930, with your concurrence, for the Political Agent at Bahrain to provide certain funds for R.A.F.Services, the question of the numerous petty payments apart from reqular remittances to Shaikhs was raised by you in your letter c/94 of 1936 dat*ed 22nd July 1936, and as a result of your further letter 2556/81/ 11 dated 22nd December 1936, the Air Ministry approved a monthly allowance of Rs.25/- for one of the Agency clerks owing to increase in work connected with P..A,F.services. 3. On the appointment of the late v/ing Commander a.R.M. Rickards, O.B. A.F.C., certain of these duties were under taken by him and carried out by him until his death, when the political Agent, with your approval, kindly undertook these services again until the appointment of the present Air Liaison Officer. This was the subject of demi-official correspondence t ’ g v . . y' (vide your letter D.G.No.25 of 1938 dated 7th January 1938, and k Air Officer commanding^ letter DO/28/1938 dated 10th February 1938) aiding with your offer of continued help in your letter B.0.458 of 9th March 1938. 4 ./ The HtKi’ble Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, The Residency, Bus hi re. Reference No 4539/33/CA .4. 3qu adr on Leader K.R.Coates has now assumed hie duties at Bahrain and taken over many of the minor R#A # F. financial services, I gather now however that a new difficulty arises, as the political Agent points out in his letter dated 3rd July 1938, It seems that the move of the post of! ice to tne centre of the town will in future deprive the Political Agent of his principal source of revenue and that he will only be left with sufficient funds for his own official use and to make the present regular monthly payments to various Shaikhs, 5. If however it is a fact that the Agency at Bahrain in future is unable to supply funds, I will have to make, with Air Ministry approval, other permanent arrangements, and possibly at the same time recommend taking over the monthly remittances to the Shaikhs so that all R,A.]?» services pass through one account, 6. You will of course appreciate that the Royal Air Porce has been frequently able to assist your Political Agents in the Gulf in other ways, and I was hoping to continue to work on a reciprocal basis. 7. Before however coming to a decision on the future financial policy of the Royal Air Force in Bahrain and the consequent withdrawal of the small allowance to the Agency clerk through the reduction in the number of the R.A.F.services I shall be glad to have your views. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, sd.

Tou will remember that when I flew home on leave at the beginning of last August we were going to have a short meeting at the Habbaniya lake. Owing, however, to the fact that my ’plane was late this was impossible and you let me have for my information a copy of your letter No*4£&gt;39/58/CA of 30th of July, under cover of a note a copy of which I enclose. S. With reference to your paragraph 6, 1 think that there is some little misunderstanding in the matter. v'e are of course only too willing to co-operate with the Hoy&amp;l Air force, from whom, as you point out, we receive valuable assistance. Briefly, the position with regard to the present question is that with the transfer into the town of the Post Office the latter will now put their receipts into the bank. This being so it will not be possible for the Political Agent to draw funds from the lost Office in order to replenish the Air Liaison Officer’s existing account with the Bank. The advances made at present by the Political Agent to the Air Liaison Officer involve a complicated accounting procedure for their recovery via the Accountant General, Central Revenues, India Office and Air Ministry. This would be avoided if arrangements were made for funds from the Iraq Command to be placed direct to the credit of the Air Liaison Officer’s account with the bank here aa and when / Air Vice Marshal J.H.3#Tyseen, M.C., Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, Habbaniya./ i !&gt; •hen he required them, and would save ue all. including tha ?.oyal Air Force finanoial authorities, a certain amount of trouble* 3, With regard to paragraph 6 of your letter *» Air iiiriistr&gt; payments to Shaikhs* *e have been disbursing the necessary earns in order to assist the Royal Air Force since we are in touch with the Shaikhs and have a Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast* If, however, you would prefer that these payments should be made direct by the Air Liaison Officer, it would of course still further simplify matters and I am quit© agreeable. # X am giving a copy of this letter to oeightman* with whom I have discussed the whole question.

J. P. GIBSONP.Z. 7659/38 No, 981-4/SO To: The Air Officer Commanding British Forces in Iraq., Ha'bbaniya* MEMORANDUM . Though Sq.u dron Leader Coates has been appointed Air Liaison Officer, Bahrein, and has now been in residence for some ti e, I find that I, as Political Agent, still receive frequent requests to provide funds for the Hoyal Air Force Works Supervisor here, and indeed for the Air Liaison Officer’s 'Public Account' which has been opened with the Eastern Bank, 2, Presumably this is due to a misconception that a branch of the Indian Treasury exists in Bahrein. Although the Political Agent is designated Treasury Officer there is in fact no currency chest or treasury, and the Political Agent at present actually obtains his funds by indenting on the surplus receipts of the Post Office here. It is anticipated that the Post Office will move in the near future from the Agency compound to the centre of the town, and when that occurs the present practice by which the Political Agent obtains his funds ?/ill cease. The Political Agent will then have no more than an account with the Eastern Bank and will in fact be in identically the same situation as the Air Liaison Officer, 5. In these circumstances I request that arrangements may be made for the Air Liaison Officer’s account with the -astern Bank to be credited direct by you with all funds necessary for the operation of his own office and for meeting the cost of other Royal Air Force activities in Bahrein including the Works and Building Branch. I am of course prepared to continue to disburse Royal Air Force payments to the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast indefinitely, since the Political authorities possess the only existing means of making over regularly such payments to the Shaikhs in satisfaction of agreements made with them, (Sgd, ) Political Agent, Bahrein,I?rom- : Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain,Persian Gulf. ^ _ • h.B.M’g Political ^gent Bahrain.

So long as this depot was under a non-commissioned officer, at the request of tne Royal Air force, the Political Agent made payments on their behalf. This was not of course, really the work of the Political Agent but 1 silling to agree to this procedure in order to assist the Royal Air force, who ; art eery good in helping us in various ways• This proce dure was regularised by the Accountant General Central Revenues in India. *hen a responsible official in the . shape of the Air Liaison Officer was appointed now ever, J*f* Gibson Require, Under secretary of State for India, /the India Office, London.- a - (U) \ th« situation sas diffsrcnt and tnle orflosr could of com&amp;c maiu tn« required payoents nimiell and proceeded to do ao« 5. There a till remained the provision of funds for this officer and so long ae the Post Office *as in the Agency and see therefore in a secure position to keep funds 9 the Air Liaison Officer could be provided *lth funds from tnls source. The Post Office is no* oeing transferred into Che tcv,n and tne following is an extract fro* a demi-official letter of mine, of Octooer 1st, 19d&amp; t to Tysstn, (The Air Ministry in their letter of 9th November make no oentlon of this cotumunicatlon). * Briefly, the position *itn regard to the present question is th* t «ith the transfer into the tosn of the Post Office tne latter sill no* put tneir receipts into the bank. This oeing so it sill not be possible for tne Political Agent to dras funds from the Post Office in order to replenish the Air Liaison Offiotr’a existing account sitn the Bank. The adv^ncea made at present by the Political Agent to the Air Liaison Officer in volve a complicated accounting procedure for their recovery via the Accountant Oeneral Central Revenues, India Office and Air Ministry. This would be avoi ded if arrangements sere made for funds from the Irsq CoiuLand to be placed direct to the credit of the Air Liaison Officer’s account with the bank here as and when he required them, and would save ue all, including the Royal Air force financial authorities, a certain amount of trouble . 'O. With regard to paragraph o of your letter — Air Ministry payments to Shaikhs. *e have been discoursing the necessary suom in order to assist the fiOysl Air force since we are in touch with the Shaikhs and have s Residency Agent on the Truciai Coast.

It seems clear from the Political Resident*s letter that he is no longer in a position to supply these funds and I presume that there would be no insuperable difficulty in arranging for the Command Accountant, Iraq.* to place fund© at the disposal of the Air Liaison Officer, at any rate to cover hi© requirements in Bahrein Itself. As regards the payments to the Tracial Sheikhs, there 1© apparently no objection to continuing the existing arrangements, but you will see that if it were desired to have these payment© made direct by the Air Liaison Officer the Political Resident would be quite agreeable. I was at first rather pussled by the reference in pore. r of the Political Resident’s letter to the *complicated accounting procedure’* for adjusting the advances as I could recollect no claims being preferred on you through this Office. It appears, however, that the Command Accountant, Iraq, remits to the Accountant-Ceneral, Central Revenues, by means of Form 1706. This procedure can hardly bo described as complicated, but the point does not affect the real difficulty, which lie© in the provision of funds. Yours sincerely, D. W.

There is nC^bjection to his helping in counting cash, but it is essential that the Accountant himself should do the last count before locking or sealing up money.' He must also supervise very carefully the sealing of any bag or envelope in which money is placed, since the res ponsibility must rest on him and not on the farrash. 21st November 1939, n “* • v- * / W (X_f I~ I' : 'irff*) tSc ***** cX^y ^ /Z&lt; ? $ t~J ' U b</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000307_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1136</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000307</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1136</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/20 III Recoveries of amounts spent on behalf of R.A.F.
