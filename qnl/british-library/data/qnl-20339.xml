There has been much talk in Kuwait during the last few days regarding a letter whioh the Shaikh has apparently received from Ibn Sa^d, urging him to agree to the collection of cuBtome duea in Kuwait town on goods exported from there to Najd, and promising to allow the resumption of trade 'between — Kuwait and l~ajd if he will do so* He said he could either j Hk establish a Customs House in Kuwait himself o: j let Shaikh Ahmad collect them for him as the latter might preffir^ The Shaikh has discuesed the question with the people of Kuwait, and has refused Ibn Sard's request, it being considered that to agree would be equivalent to reoo,nlfling his overlordship over Kuwait^ Ibn Sa'ud is said to have raised the question on mere than one occasion before, his request becoming more pressing each time, and people are wondering what his next move will be.

He added that the matter would be settled on the basis of payment of several lakhs per annum by Kuwait to Bin Saud, and that a resumption of Kuwait trade would be very disadvantageous to Bahrain and Hassa merchants. This is significant inasmuch as the Oosaibi family who have much influence with Bin Saud, have almost all the trade via Bahrain. Politi cal.6 l/P ' Telegram R. From Political, Kuwait.

Parties necessarily need bmx guidance from us. xhe matin object of the visit of the vT e.1d Agent is that the Sheikh of Kuwait should satisfy him and you by friendly examination of the Customs records what is the actual average volume and value of ne.jd imports and exports via Kuwait. It would then be our business to arbitrate or impose a fair division. At present Kuwait levies four per cent on imports and another four per cent on transit duty, which is quite indefensible. I am not sure what is levied on exports. As you Vnow Bahrain only levies two and a half per cent on Nejd imports. Please endeavour to elicit approximate figures involved (?) for imports and exports, and what they now represent in income to the SheiVh of T uwait. We can then consider what would be a reasonable solution, and if either party does not accept our suggestion, obtain permission from London to give ^authoritative advice'.

The prohibition of all trade with auwait by Najd subjects was the direct result of Shaikh ^hmad's refusal. V'hen ^ir Percy visited Kuwait on his way back from 'Uqair he prOiX&gt;undea his scheme for a Customs /Agreement bei .v ^een Najd and Kuwait, including the proposal that Ibn ba'ud should maintain a clerk here, to Shaikh Ahmad , and saia that if he agreed in princip1 * e arrange with ibn kia 'ud to bend a CustomB expert to fix up ue ^ails 01 an Agreement, ^haikli Ahmad - who ie a perfectly ch:.riiiin^ man to talk to, but lamentably weak - merely replied in platitudes that it ¥»ould be delightful to be able to come to cn agreement and have trade with Najd reopened, but said not a vord about his objections, if he had any at the time.

Hi 'd S of 1923. British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushlre, 10th July 1923. HEJD CUSTOMS OOLLEOTIONS AT KUWAIT. My Lord Duke, In continuation of my despatch 893-S dated June 20th, I have the honour to report that when sayyid Hamza, Bin Saud* s representative abandoned the negotiations at Kuwait and returned to Riyadh, he went accompanied by gheiih Abdullah as Salim as Subah, as representative of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The Political Agent, Kuwait, now infoms me that Sheikh Abdullah has returned from Riyadh, and that except for an exchange of gifts and compliments between himself and Bin Saud, his miseion is believed to have been fruitless. Fetters therefore remain as they were between the Sheikh of Kuwait and the Amir of Nejd when I last addressed Your Grace. I have the honour to be,with the highest respect. Your Graces most obedient.

In continuation of my meniorandum No. iCC-S of 2bth June 19^2 Shaikh 'Abdullah as-^alim's return from Riyadh has not V passed off quite so quietly as it at first appeared to be going to do. It seems that he came to a private understanding with Ibn Ua'ud, by which the letter was to recognise him as his agent in Kuwait, with whom alone he would correspond, and was to allow trade between Kuwait and Najd to be reopened, in return for .the ./hole of the customs dues on goods exported from Kuwait by land, other than those destined for the bhaikh of Kuwaiti own subjectc or for 'Iraq, which Shaikh Abdullah wi;s to collect and remit to 4 him, Shaikh 'Abdullah as-Salim had a long private interview with Shaikh Ahmad on the iiOth June, in which he is believed to have urged him to settle the matter himself without taking the advice of his people, as, he said, it had nothing to do with them. The Shaikh however would not agree to this, and it wns eventually agreed that Shaikh 'Abdullah would come to the Shaikh's audience chamber and tell the people what had passed between him and Ibn Sa'ud, and Shaikh Ahmad would Lhen see what they advised. On the morning of the 30 Un June Shaikh -^hmad said Shaikh 'Abdullah visited Saiyid Hamid Beg an-Naqib, and spent an hour with him. Shaikh 'Abdullah again urged Shaikh Ahmad to accept these terms, and not lo consult uhe people about it at all. On Lhe evening of the 3Cth June a meeting was held at which the following were present: Shaikh Ahmad, Shaikh 'Abdullah as- ^alim, Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, Shamlan, Kamad as-Saqar, Hamaa al- . Khalid,iihalld. Shaikh Yusuf bin ' Isa ana Almad al-Uufiiaidhi, ^.tdull4*h uB-iiilliia first (iescrnr&gt;ecl his journey and Ibn ba'ud's presents, and then dwelt on the vital importance of accepting. Ibn Sa'ud's terms, and said tlvt hp Boon a^ they did so he, as his a^ent, would send Ibn ^a'ud 1 * men out to tell the tribes that they could come to Kuwait for trade, No one spoke at first.then Shamlan said that friendship with Ibn tia'ud was most desirable but they were not goin^ to have trade reopened at the expense of their own Shaikh 's Customs dues. r ^hey then all demanded that another meeting, should be called for the following day at which the rest of the notables of the town should be pre sent. The bhaikh agreed to this, and he and Shaikh Jabir as-Subah left the palace. Shaikh 'Abdullah as-£&gt;alim • - then addressed them again ^nd urjed them to agree to the terms with him as Ibn Sard's agent. Yusuf bin 'Isa then took up the tale and said that they would never have any rest until they chose buullah and gave him their full help, Cn the afternoon of the Ist July a meeting of twenty one of the notables - without the Shaikh or any of his family - ^as held in Hamad al-Khalid's housej and the matter was again discussed, ^usuf bin 'Isa said that they would never have any rest until they agreed to these terms and got trade reopened; the only thing, t^tlo was to put up the Export Euty to 4 per cent, for everything, and R.i/- a bag in the case of rice in accordance with the old Kuwait custom, and to recognise Shaikh 'Abdullah as-^alim as Ibn Sard's agent with a free hand in all matters relating to the desert;proper accounts to be kept, and the proceeds of all export duty, except that on goods going to ^ubair find other places in ' Iraq and on goods for Shaikh Ahmad* s own subjects, to be remitted to Ibn Sa 'ud half ye.'rly by Shaikh 'Abdullah. When they heard that Shaikh 'Abdullah as-oaiim, and not an outsider, was to be Ibn Sa 'ud 's agent, the majority agreed, and they drew up a document embodying these points: viz a standard rate of 4 per cent, export duty, the reopening of trade, and the authorization of Shaikh 'Abdullah as- ^alim to act in the matter. Shamlan &gt; however, objected, and said that he did not agree: and Hamad as-Saqar said that it was a matter of foreign policy which concerned the Shaikh alone, and that they had no right to interfere. One or two others axo. said the 8cime j but seventeenseventeen out of the twenty one actually signed it. Shaikh ^usuf at once sent the doc^oment to Shaikh Ahmad, and it reached him at about B p,m. On the morning of Londay, the 2nd July, Shaiidh lUnimad went to the as usual, but said nothing about the matter at all. Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, however, and the other members of the bubah family had plenty to say on the subject, and said that the whole idea was preposterous, as Ibn Sa'ud had no right at all to what he claimed and that it wf-s unthinkable that Sh&amp;ikh 'Abdullah should act as his agent. On the morning of the 3rd July Shaikh, Jabir as~k&gt;ubah xxatatxiam had a long t?wlk with Shaikh -whrnad on the subject in the Market x^lace and urged him to reject the proposal off hand. Shaikh Ahmad went straight back to his house, and first of all sent for Shamlan and discussed the matuer with him; then, after he had left, he sent for Hamad as-Saqar and asked his advice.. He is said to be very much distressed at the whole affair, and it is thought that he will probably reject it. xnere has been a great deal of talk in the town about it. Shaikh 'Abdullah is reported to be saying that if the proposal is rejected he will write a full account of what has happened to Ibn t^ud, but he hopes this will not be necessary ^ he also says that he will then claim his full share of the family property to which the law entitles him, Sttaikh Jilbir as-Subah and the other members of the ruling family are extremely angry about it, and very bitter against those who signed t.he document. These however, with the exception of Hamad al-Hhalid, ^aiyid 'Abdur Rahman bin as^Saiyid A-halaf an-I^ 1 qlb and Yusuf bin f Isa, were men of no great importance ^nd were probab7.y influenced not a little by fear. It was Yusuf bjc 'Isa who drew up the document and was chiefly responsible for getting it signed. There is little doubt, of course, that Shaikh *AbdullafcL as-Salim was the author of the whole idea, and. thatAt w% he \vho persuaded Ibn Sa'ud to authorise him to act for him, and that his hope is get the power into his own hands with a view to his eventually making himself Shaikh of Kuwait in place of Shaikh Ahmad. Hie action is merely such as I expected him to take from the time—— the time that I firBt he£ird that Shaikh 'Abdullah was bein^ sent to KiyEdh. J-n the merin while MhaiXli 4ihmad is merely procrastinat ing, and will come to no decision. Shaikh -^hniad himself has not mentioned the matter to me at all, but i have learned the above from sources which are usuallyNo. 105-S. To CONFIDENTIA L. IU8HIBI BE8IOFNO o; • » K .

In continuation of my memorandum Mo»^03 aated 7th July On Saturday the 7th July Shaikh 'Abdullah as-tiallm aaked for, and received, im interview with shaikh ^Uiiswi and spent about half an hour with him. V/hat tr; ns:)ired ia not known, but when Shaikh * Abdullah came out he told one of his servants in rather a marked manner to hold himself in readiness to start for Riyadh in a day or two's time. On the morning of the 8th July Shaikh Ahmad sent word to Shaikh Jabir as -Subah, Hamad al -Khalid, £hamlan. He.mad as-baqar, ^hailth lusuf bin l Isa and Ahmad al-Humaidhi that he wished to see them th^-t afternoon. When they had assembled he asked them their views.Shaikh Jabir said chat he would never ag;ree lo uhe proposal in any shape or form ^as he was strongly $ opposed uo leouing ibn oa'ud get a looting in uhe uown. ne could not see wn^, aiter all Uie lengthy negotiations on une subjecv with Government which had S/T-C^tc/c^. oaken place and which ^naikn Anmaa nad broken orf, ne uninx of accepuing uhis, lie saw no harm in his giving Ibn ^a l ud a fixed sum i&lt;C he liked ~ and friendship with him was certainly most desir- able^ but it would be better for him to arrange things uhrough Government. iiamad al-IQialid advocated fixing a standard 4 per cent export duty and remitting it all to Ibn Sa r ud through Shaikh 'Abdullah, who alone would correspond with him. Ke said he thought they should try this for a year first, and rarer^e the right of discontinuing, it if it did not prove satisfyn-tory* Hamad*iiantfid s^ici 'tJriey could not. expiree uo u^nci o\er the Customs to Ufa ^a'ud, but tliat the Shaikh ougjit to satisfy Ibn Sa ! ud by giving him money - not Customs dues - and try to come to an rirran^ement with him Tor trade to oe reopened,. bhamlan said he thought it better for trade ^ to ^ reopen ed, in view of the type of people the IJshwan wt were Shaikh Yusuf said he felt sure that the Shaikh himself knew best what to do^ and , before ftlwiifl al~Humaidiii had an opporturiity of stating, his views. Shaikh Ahmad broke up the meeting, asking them to think the matter over again for a couple of days, when he would send for li them again. The above mentioned people were again summoned for XiUt the morning of the ivjtxi July, as also was ^ijaikii 1 Abdullah as-Salim, and Shaikh iUimad again asked them their views, Hamad al~Khalid said he still advocated their folloming the terms of the document which they had. presented to the lihaikh, and Shaiidi Yusuf warmly seconded this, ^haikli Jabir ^ s~*iubah repeated that he would never agree to Ibn ^a^d being given any share in the Kuwait Customs, but that he should be satisfied in some other way. Shamlan said he thought the stoppage of urade was -uhe best thing for them on the whole, as whe Ikhwan were nasty people uo have near one, and Shaikh Ahmad could not keep them in order. Hamad as-^aqar said that they could not give Ibn i^a'ud the Kuwait Customs, but that he thought they might satisfy him in some other way, and induce him to alio v. trade to be reopened, Hamad al- iihalid thereupon accused him of having selfish motives for taking this line. He, of course, meant (as may well be true) that H&amp;mad as~^aqar, being in such close business relations as he is with itfian ^ahib 'Abdul Latif, the director of Customs, does not want the Customs to be under any better supervision than at present, ^ome very plain speaking was then indulged in all round, and Shaikh Jabir accused Shaikh Yusuf of having manoeuvred the whole thing and Induced people to sign the document without knowing what they were signing, 'haikh Ahmad then turned to Hamad al-Khalld, and aaked him what he recommended he should write to Ibn Sa'ud u if he agreea towhat he suggested. Earned replied thr.t he thou^i'it this wat: a natter which they ml^ht well leave to Shaikh * Abdul Ich., The ShalJch got furious and said Abdullah is not of the Sa 1 ^ family, nor is he in their employ, he is one of the Subuh; you cannot answer anything except ' 'Abdullah ^ and you had better stop this', Shaikh Jabir uhen said:''.Vell^ Shaikh i^imad, you are une Kuler find you know now what everyone thinks, and you had better do what £1 you think Dest' , and he and Hamad as-Saqar left tne room, A rev/ minutes later the whole meeting broke up, Un tne evening of tne -LCtn iJuly HarU d as , -'Saq(.r invited iihaikii itoiad, Jabir as -Subah and ^hamlan to dinner on his launch. Shaikh Ahmad got back to his house a little after I p .m., and at once sent for ; nd interviewed Shaikh Yusuf bin 'Isa, but wh' t passed betv.een them is not known. He, Sh.' ikh Yusuf, is said to have drawn up a draft letter to Ibn Sa'ud and handed it to the bhaikh on the mornirb- of the litn ^uly. The Sht ikh put it in his pocket without comment, and without even reading it. Shaikh 'Abdullah as-oalim came into Kuwait from ^ha'b on the Hth, having written to Shaikh Ahmad tiie evening before asking, for an interview. There is a rumour now that Shaikh ^hmajci has agreed to everything; and is writing to Ibn Sa 'ud accordingly, but I fancy this emanated from some retainer of Shaikh 1 Abdullah 1 s ana is exag- {^eiciued, A no uher theory is that ^haii-Ja Aiamad is vfriting to Ibn- t' | — _ ua uc to put forward certain counter proposf-le. and to ;,ak certain queetione, and - chiefly - to put off having to coiae to a declelon, anc 1 think, this ie much uore prob; ble, ould have seemed Euch a good opportunity for the Shaikli to have taken the advice you gave him recently and suejeeted to Ibn Sa'ud that we should be aaaed to lend a trained Customs official for a few years, until the value of the land custoas was Itnov.Ti -.r.c, ■ fixed annual payment could be agreed upon, but he seems to have quite lost hie faith in us for the time being. He presuaab^- ::, u : 1 realise th; t if he agrees to chis proposal, he win very soon be auler of Kuwait only xn name - if th; t -, as Shaikh 'Abdullah is not a man to let tne grass grow under his feet, and would very soon extend his power from the desert into the town.

Your Hignness, When 1 had the pleasure of seeing your envoy dy«d ^»hi* at EUBhire 1 made tentative to him a to how Your Highn*'»'» would regard aa attempt on my part to sttle the dispute betweea Kuwait and Hejd on the subject oi CUtotOBo dues on t?ood Imported via Kurwait into Central ^rabia , especially iiil Kasin and beyond. dyed xia^nim replied that he had no lndtruotioni&amp; but he ventured to expreba the hope iafitft and opinion that Your Highness would be ready to fall in with any reasonable proposals for putting an end to a state of affairs which was equally damaging to Kuwait trade and Your Highneaa' subjectG in the Interior. Acting on that hope 1 have addressed His Majesty's deoreiary of SV-te for the Oolonies and ha-v^ received his approval to do what 1 can in the matter. Colonel 'Prevox to whom 1 hav« handed over charge of the Persian Oulf Residency yesterday, lias paid that he will be obliged if 1 will kindly endaavour to get th i3 question settled during the fortiioomiag conference at Kuwait if the latter is finally approved . Your HigimebS is no doubt aware that there j,. at present a Customs expert from the Bombay Customs , an iinglisiman who is at present engaged in reorganizing the working of the Bahrain Customs and 1 thinK it would 'be of very great tenetlt to all concerned if this gentleman, who2 who is thorougnly jkilieu an&lt;i experienced in Coatomfl mattero , were \,o s't'Jdy th® qu^sttion oT ifflportr^ trO Cen'tral xiXabia via Kuwait and ^ive ub th« benef it of hi** exper ience and guidance in matters . would no doubt be able to devise means by which imports into ^ejd were pro -perly classified and if your Highness thinks it advisable, arrange for clear forms, of course written in xijrabic , by which Your Highness* representatives at such places as puraidah anc ^nizeh would be able to see at a srlance what goods had l*tt by a apecili«d from Kuwait, and facilitate the task of Vour Elghness' representatives in collecting such additional dues as Your iiighness migfrt deem necessary. 1 have been informed that Your Highness haa to 14 dhaikh Ahmed that you cannot consent to anything less than 7^ on all goods imported, for yourseli . Whether this is a fact or not 1 am not fully aware,but 4&gt;uch a condition of itself would land Shaikh Ahmed in difficulties as such a duty is much higher than those already in force in Kuwait .^rab indeed on the whole^iittoral ol the pe-rsian Gull from muscat upwards. Your E ^ghne^s is no doubt well aware that much of the prosperity of the ^rab littoral is due to the fact that the rulers have had the good aerwe to keep the duties low. ^t present the in^uirie^ of Major wore go to show that the general rate of duty i^ consUerably leos than 4^; and 1 do not think that Shaikh ^nmed could impose a higher duty than 5^ ad valorem. The rough plan which 1 sketch out for Your Highness' approval, to be varied by subsequent discussion is that ^1) the door oi trade throjagh Kuwait to Central Arabia should be thrown open hy Your Highness on condition that (a) a scientific 5^ ad valorem duty should be coll ected on all goodb imported to Central ^rabia via Jejd ; (b) the respective ahares of Kuwait and xlejd should bebe settled by negotation: (o; the Cub tonus due on imvortB to Central rxrabia via ilejd should be collected by a qualified clerk under the iDJuediate suj^ervifiion of the Political ^igent &gt; Kuwait, and the Kuwait and IJejd shares determined for the period of on© year i (d) -tt.t the termination of the year a cadh valuation should be formed of the s^ate of the duties that might reasonably be expected to acciuae to Jejd guid Shaikh Ahmed would undertckke to ^aa pay the sum arrive&lt;J at for a period of # «ay , five or ten years when , on six months' notice by either party, a similar arrangement might be come to for the re -valuation of the Nejd share . Failing puoh not ice the agreement to be continued and Kuwait to pay the Hejd share as valued above. (e) If Your Highness thinks it really aecedbary , though 1 am inclined to deprecate auch a course a3 likely to lead to correspondencej increased expense in collection, dis^ufces and smuggling, the organization of a system 3C by which ka^a£ahs should be bound to produce on their arrival at principal towns in Central .Arabia, certified invoices of the poods theycarry,on wnich Your Highness' officials could collect additional dues* at Your Highness * discretion, might be considered. Tht Shaikh of Kuwait has agreed in principle to some such arrangement and 1 think it promises the best chance of a settlement, if Your Highness would see that the envoy you send to the Conference is also given full power to make the best arrangement possible on the above lines 1 trust that there will be no great dilliculty. four Highness knows my ki^iy feelings for Kuwait, the first post in Arabia at which 1 had the honour to serve , and I feel sure also that Your Highne x too retains a kindly recollection of the town from which Your H-fgnness started * youryour car*®** of oon^ueet and glory, axxi so 1 beg personally to intercede with Your Hignnefcs to see that Kuwait trade la not rerioualy daniaged and to beg for Your Highness' kindly oonbideration in this rcatter . Cne point remains: the expeniiea of the Custoins ol^f ioe^ deputed froiL Bombay will have to be met and 1 think a pound sum of ^ 2,000/- is the utmost which we shall have to ask from Your Highness in payment for his services .

In this connection I transmit herewith, for your consideration, a copy of a letter (with . enclosures) which has 'bjeen received from the India Office on the subject.

THE POLITICAL RE SI LENT ^ TTTTn IN THE PERSIAN GULP, BUSHIRE.P.47S1. N0.1727S dated 12.12.23 % ENCi-^iuRETO DESi'ArOH J48r OF ;b///^0 India Office, VJhitehall, London, S.W.I. 20 J Gh December, 1923. In reply to your letter of /ulie 14th September, Mo.43397, I am directed by the Secretery of State for India to forward,to be laid before the Secretary of State for the Colonies, tne accompanying copy of a telegram from the Government of India on the subject of the extension of Nejdi influence in Bahrein and Kov/eit. In regard to the position at Kov/eit where it seems the Sultan of Nejd has contemplated the extension of his influence through the agency of Sheikh Abdullah -as-Salim, under cover of an arrange- nent in respect of customs duties on -ooo-s passing throurh Koweit to and from Nejd, the Secretary of State shares the Government of India's diffidence in offerin:.: any comment. But pyima facjL.e it v:ould appear, as the Govern)lent 0- India sugges ^ .-la j uiiC arrangement in question would, in any case, oe in contravention of the spirit oi the uiicieroalcingsoiven by Kis Majesty's Government in Article IX of the Agreement of 15th Oct. 1907 with Sneikh Muoara^v o^. Koweit (and repeated in the message of 5th July 1913 to Sheikh Salim) and by Ibn Saud in Article VI of the Treaty of 26th December 1915: r and in contraven tion of the letter also of these Agreements, if tne arrangement were imposed on the Sheikh and people of Koweit without their full consent. ..lore over, however THE UNDSR SECH^TAHY 0? STATE, COLONIAL OFFICE.however willingly the arrangement rni^ht be accepted by Koweit in the first instance, it would seem to have inherent dangers of friction between Koweit and Nejd in the future. In so far as Ibn Saud f s apparent attempt to extend his influence over Koweit is actuated by a desire to regularise the imposition of dues on Nejdi imports and exports overseas, it would seem desirable, if it is practicable, to seek a solution of the Koweit Nejdi dispute, by finding for Nejd some other outlet to the sea than Koweit, and developing it. In 1920 (vide enclosed copy of a telegram from Sir P.Cox) Ibn Saud was anxious to develop one of his Hasa ports. The matter was referred by Lord Inchcape (who was consulted semi-officially) to the Managing Agents in India of the British India Steam Navigation Company for direct discussion with Sir P. Cox; and the Secretory of State is not aware of what may have resulted. If possible, however, the develop ment of a port of his own by the Sultan of Nejd would seem most desirable not only as tending to eliminate causes of friction with and aggression on Koweit and B ahrein, but also as the Government of India indicate, as causing him to establish a valuable interest exposed directly to His Majesty's Governments power. In regard to Bahrein, the Secretary of State agrees with the view expressed by the Government of India; the elimination of Nejdi influence in those islands would no doubt be expedited, no less than in Koweit, by the development, should it prove possible, of a port in Nejdi territory. I have etc., (Sd) L .D. V/akely,% TELEGRALI PROIa VICEROY, TO SECRETARY OP STATE POR INDIA, DATED 12.12.23. P.1727. Please refer to your telegrams dated 19th September and 14th November , Nos.3392 and 4050. As you are a^v/are, we are, on principle averse from commitments in regard to the hinterland of Arabia but, treaty obligations, which v/e must of course observe, complicate the position in regard to Koweit. On the one hand, definite promise has been given by Ibn Saud, himself, that he will refrain from all inter ference with or aggression upon Koweit territories;and on the other hand, possession of the 'town of Koweit and its boundaries' (whatever the exact meaning of that phrase may be) has been guaranteed by us to Ibn Subah family and, in our treaty with Ibn Saud, we have apparently mentioned Sheikh of Koweit as one of the protected Sheikhs. No allusion, earlier than April, 1922, to Ion Saud's suggestion that collection of his customs dues should be made in town of Koweit, instead of on his own frontier, can be traced in our records. In addition, we have no detailed information, since that date, regarding the course of His Majesty's Government's negotiations with Ibn Saud on this point. Our remarks are, therefore, given with diffidence, but, prima facie, both our own and Ibn Saud's engagements would appear to be violated by Ibn Saud's suggestion, and latter, for this reason, should be opposed. If this is dono, automatic decrease in Ibn Saoid's influence in Koweit, will take place. Apart from our obligations to protected Sheikhs, including Koweit, we should welcome Ibn Saud's extension to sea, pre ferably in port which he has himself developed. He would thus be rendered more accessible to our nava.l powerV pov/er but possible effect of policy which Kis Majesty's Government now contemplates regarding our relations with Ion Saud, is a question which is beyond our purview. As regards Bahrein, we should welcome extinction of Ibn Saud's influence in that island.?{• A.E.B./A. G/l.I.P. P 7446 1920 COPY OF TEI ECrP^vl X Prom Sir P.Cox to Sec. of State Dated Kumah 5.10.20. Received 3 a.m. 8.10.20. 3957 No-.13/102. Visit of Merchant Steamers to Hassa Ports. Bin Saud has two legitimate objects in view. Firstly to relieve his subjects from the exactions, and often harassing attentions which they at present experience from the Customs (?Authorities) at Kowe it and Bahrein; especially the latter. Secondly, to create a source of State revenue for himself. At present the Sheikhs of Kowe it and Bahrein knowing that Nejd traders have no alternative than to import through their ports, are in a position to exact their pound of flesh to the full, and to harass Nejd trade when their relations with Bin Saud are strained. I have not as yet heard result of recent references of H.M.Government to the British India Steam Navigation Company, but following steps seem to me called for:- Firstly, to inform British India Steamship Navigation Company that Bin Saud has been pressing for some years past, and now with insistence, for the regular visit of a Merchant steamer to one or all of his ports, namely, Ojair, Katif, and Jubail, and that H.M.G. would be glad to see (?his wish) gratified. That a regular service to above ports by a small subsidiary steamer based on Basrah would seem to meet the case best, end they would be glad if British India Steam Navigation (?Coy) would examine the question forthwithforthwith, and say what they can best manage. Pending outcome of negotiations on above lines, it is proposed, as result of my discussion with Bin Saud, that merchants engaged in import trade to Nejd should arrange with B.I.3.N.C., Bombay and Karachi, to liave their (?consignments) manifested and mar Iced for 'Hassa Ports', and to transfer them in Bahrein Harbour to dhows especially engaged to ply betv/een Bahrein and OJair etc. Political Agent, Bahrein will take this (?up) with British Indian Landing Contractor at Bahrein, and if necessary, with the Sheikh who might be allowed to levy small (?trans-shipment) fees, but no longer full duty. Pending intimation of result of Govern ment reference to British India Steam Navigation Company, no action will be taken from here as re gards establishment of subsidiary steamer.3. I shall be glad to learn whether you concur in this view, in which case I should be prepared to consider the question of approaching * the British India Steam Navigation Company, with a view to securing the early establishment of a port of call at Qp.tif in consultation and co-operation with Ibn Saud. 4 . Should it be decided to take action in this direction, there would be no objection to your informing Ibn Saud of the steps which His Majesty 1 s Government are talcing in the matter and of the reasons which have actuated them, but in doing so you should take especial care to avoid giving the impression -that there is any intention on the part of His Majesty's Government to utilise the new arrangements as a means of extending their political influence in Nejd territory, whether through the medium of a British Political Agent at the port or in any other manner.

Reference correftpondenfte ending with my telegraia No, 130-5 dated the 3oth April The people of Kuwait are now getting over their panic caused b/ Dhaidan al-Hithlain*s raid, but the town wall ir still wanned to sooie extent at night, and the country is still patrolled daily between Shu'aibah, ^ubaihiyah *-nd Jahrah. One of the demands which the people aaade for the defertfL of the town was that Shaikh 'All al-Xlialifah should be given command, and should have an absolutely free hand and should be assisted in every way possible. To this Shaikh Ahmad readily agreed. Shaikh '-AXi al-Xhalifah was selected not only because he knows more about Arab warfare than any other member of the Subah Family, but also because he is opposed to Shaikh 'Abdullah as^Saiim, who is Shaikh Ahmad's rival, and a clever and una&amp;rapalous man who would not be expeoted to stick at trifles if he saw a chance of betterii^ his own fortune*^ r 'h'j The messengers referred to in ny telegram Ko, 138 -3 of 26th April brought no message of interest. On the 4th May, hot/ever. Shaikh Ahmad received a most satisfactory letter fro a Ibn Sa'ud, in which he expressed hia regret at some small raids on Kuwait subjects by the 'Awazim under lb® ^Ashwan in the end of March, and said that he had ordered ^11 plunder taken by them to be returned # From this it is hoped that he will take the same action in the case of Ibn Hithlain 1 s raid,.

My 130 -S. v' Foliowinr is summary of letter dated 7th May from Ihn Saud to you, 'begins: 'I hear with great regret that Dhaidan has raided some Mutair and Ajman in Kuwait territory which is friend of both H .M .Government and myself. 'Tii^s v;as without permission and in soi'.e of rny orders to all Shi.ikhs to Iceep peace.

Obviously things will get worse unless I punish guilty ^ tribes, but I am prevented from doing so by the fear that they will flee to Iraq and be given refuge there, as happened Ic.st year. If K.i: Goveirni:ient will assist me in expelling the guilty tribes from Iraq and will promise on behalf of Covern- , -men 1s under their mandate or protection, that those Governments will not give asylum and protection to my guilty tribes, I will undertake to immediately punish all tribes guilty of aggression against subject neighbouring Governments.

Shaikh* letter had not arrived before messenger left Riyadh nor did they meet his men on the way. Although it seems i possible to accede to ^in Saud r s request as a whole, I venture to suggest possibility of obtaining for him uarantee that Dhaidan and his followers will not be given asylum within a given period unless he makes r^stiturion for recent raids.

To The Hon ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Tribal Disputes. MEMORANDUM. Some weeks ago Habis bin Ashwan, of the Ubaiyat family of the Auiad Wasil sub-section of the Puraih section of the Mutair, raided the Awazim*. Tne latter appealed to Ibn Sa'ud, who ordered restitution to be made, and told the 'Awazim that they could attack Ibn 'Ashwan if he did not comply with his orders. Ibn Ashwan made excuses and refused to disgorge all the plunder, and so on the 20th May the Awazim, under their paramount Shaikh, Ibn Jami' of tha Hedalin sub-section of the Ku'ah .section of the tribe, with three hairaqs attacked Ibn 'Ashwan at Nuqair (Indjair on the Asia 1 :1,000,000 Maps), 110 miles S. S. E. of Kuwait. Ibn Ashwan had only about 150 men but put up a very stubborn fight, though greatly out numbered by the 'Awazim. Ibn Ashwan himself, his son, and more than half his followers were killed, and the Awazim, whose losses were also extremely heavy, captured all their property. The survivors appealed for help to Haif al-Fuqam of the Sahabah family of the Muwal'.ah sub-division of the 'Ilwah section of the Mutair, who attacked a se-jtion of the 'Awazim under Shaikh Duraf and recovered a portion of the plunder. Fuqam himself, however, was wounded and is believed to have died. The Mutair have sent word to Faisal ad-Dawish, but up to the present l.here is no woid of his moving. The 'Ajman. under Dhaidan al-Hithlain, have allied themselves with the 'Awazim and promised them assistance should they require it. Ibn Sa'ud',s action in giving the 'Awazim permission to attack Ibn 'Ashwan has caused much comment in Kuwait, and speculation is rife as to what he will do now. According to one rumour he had intended to go to Hasa about now. (Signed) J. C. MORE, Major, Political Agent, Kuwait, (\ py. with compliments, to the :— Secretary to H. E.

They killed six men and captured nearly two hundred camels, and themselves lost one man killed and three wouhded. The refugees wanted to take refuge in Jahrah village, but were refused admittance by the Shaikh's representative.

An-Nafisi is said to have sent 30-copies of the 'Nationality Certificates' to Bin ^mghathic at Zubair 'by the hand of a man named Bin M ah tab. &gt;2. , On hearing of the activities_of an-Nafisi I drew H .E. Shaikh Ahmad 1 s attention to the agreement dated 20th Eamadhan 1306, i.e. 2 3rd January 1899, by which the Shaikh of Kuwait undertook to receive no agent or representative of any Power without the previous sanction of the British Government, and enquired as to the duties of Abdullah bin Nafisi. In his reply dated 3rd Habi ath-Thani 1346 of which I enclose a translation, H.S.

I am credibly informed that His Excellency has Just sent a letter to H,M. Bin Sa'ud, by hand of a man^Abdullah AbulKhali, in which he has explained that he has asked Nafisi to discontinue issuing certificates, till he hears further from his master as the Shaikhs of Kuwait are precluded from accepting in Kuwait the agent or representative of any Power without the consent of His MaJesty^s Government. f &gt; •Abdullah an-Nafisi is H,M. Bin Sa'ud's private trade agent in Kuwait in the same manner as Khan Bahadur ♦Abdul 'AEifl Qusaibi is his agent in Bahrain. He occasionally certifies the signatures of Najd. officials on documents intended to be forwarded to 1 Iraq. Courts, and the Political Agent thereupon certifies Nafisi 1 s signature. He appears to have performed no other official function. - private In virtue of his position as Bin ba'ud's Trade Agent his house is a rendez-vous for Najdis but it is sail that has hitherto confined himself to trade and has taken no part in politics.

A/u • , I have received your letter No. 142 dated the 2nd instant (i.e. 20,9.1927) and noted the contents regarding •Abdullah tin Hamad an-Nafisi, and the papers he had received from H.M. King 'AMul 'Aziz as-Sa'ud. I 'beg to inform you that I had the information about the papers as soon as they were received 'by the aforesaid person and at that time I had called him and enquired about them. He said 'I have no information about them except that I have received a letter from H.M. King * Abdul 'Aziz with which those papers were attached with an order to forward them to Zubair for H.M's Najd subjects residing in ♦Iraq.' He said that he had actually sent them to Zubair. We of course will never agree for any person to interfere in such matters in Kuwait. The above person is ixSciKiial a merchant by profession and is the agent for King 'Abdul ♦Aziz and looks after his private affairs. In addition to my first enquiry I called him again ant repeated my questions in regard to those papers in reply to which he said 'I did not taam inter fere in any body's case at Kuwait and it is not possi ble for me to do so*' . We told him that we did not accept any agent or representative of any Power or Government whether he interfered in the matter of subjects or did not, and warned him not to interfere. We have totally prevented him from doing so. Usual Ending.61/7 Bin Saud is probably not aware of the terms of the agreement of 1899.

Nafisi declared that he had received no applications from inhabitants of Kuwait but admitted despatch of the card to Zubair.

When near to the Kuwait frontier both were siezed by the Ajman rebels and imprisoned, though not before ibn Rabai had managed to hand over his sacidlebags containing the money and letters to ibn M^lyus with the request that if he got away, he should keep the contents in trust and hand them over to no man but the s^ud at Riath, (3)« Ibn Malyus, the rebels released as soon as they knew he was the sheikh of Kuwait's meseenser but Al pabai they cast into Irons. (4). in due course Ihn Malyus reached Kuwait, aelivered his own letters and reported the condition of Al Rabai. (5). In the meantime K.B. Mullah saleh the sheikhs Wazir by means best known to himself got to know that ibn Malyus was in posoesslon of the saddlebags contains ing Al Rabai's secret matter, so sending for him he demanded that the contents be hanuea over. Ibn Malyus to save himself handed over the letters, but2oS UZ- (2) % but said nothing of the money which he looked, upon as a 'truBt 11 on behalf of Al Rabai. The aarae nigh^ he ibn MalyuB fled to the Ajman camp, told Al Ribai what he had done and continued his Journey to Riath, whilst there he was joined by Al Ribai who had been released by the personal intervention of Sheikh Ahmed in the meanwhile. (7). A month later ibn Malyus appeared once more in Kuwait bearing a letter from Aroii' cjaoud explaining what purported to be the reason why he ion i/[ a lyus had run away to Riath, and bearing another letter to Al Nafisi instructing the latter to take over the ii7y0/- in gold from ibn Malyus, (B). The point now is for whom was the 4^700/- in gold, and to whom were the confidential letters addressed. These latter are now in the hands of Mull&amp;h s a llb, and he has a most powerful weapon for blackmail. That he will also use it is certain, unless,( and this is not at all an unlikely contingency ) he himself is in the pay of Bin saud, and one of the letters was for him as was also part of the £700/~ . (W). I am assured that sheikh Ahmed knows nothing of the story, and still less suspects any of his officials of being in the pay of Bin S^-ud. I on the contrary am morally certain that sbeikh Ahmed is surrounded by rogues and traitors, both amongst his relatives and among his chief officials. j do not include the sons of Mohomed and Jarrah, brothers of sheikh Mubarak whom the latter murdered, and who reside today at rut «s zain and zubair. I cannot blame these latter if they intrigue. (10)- The curious part of the business is the sending of the £700/~ in gold. As everyone knows pin s^ud frequently sends Nafiai large sums of money to buy supplies, tents etc. etc., but this is always done bybv 'hawala', In the present caae the names mentioned by my informant as the persons for whom the money was Intended were (a). K.B. Mullaii sa-leh. Coutwaruly very anti i* (b). K.B. Abdul Uarmly pro B.S. )• (11). If there Is any truth in the above story and some of Sheikh Ahmed's entourage and officials have a foot in the other camp for personal ends in caae Bin Sauu ever should get hold of fuwait ). then Sheikh Ah mads case is indeed a difficult one, for every one of his secrets will assuredly be conveyed to the other sicie. On the other hand if Sheikh Ahmad is aware of his officials duplicity, then all is well. It shows he is keeping himself under restraint, and watching events quietly. I send the above story for what it is worth, you have more knowledge of Kuwait than I have , and you may think it a ' canard '. I sincerely hope it is. All well here.
