However, Abdulla Khan denies that permission has been granted for General John Malcolm or Captain Pasley to proceed to Tehran, but if they travel to Sheraz there is little doubt that it will be granted. It is also mentioned that the Shaik Abdul Russool [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] has departed with infantry for Karrack.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x000005#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
