Following this is the instruction to send surplus cash at Bushire to Basra in case the Khan turns hostile to the Company. There is approval for the purchase of a boat to carry correspondence between the Agency and the Residency, but disapproval sending the linguist to Yezd with so much of the Company's cloth during these dangerous times.
