Nothing is known of the man at Ahwaz (undjpr either name) or at the Soviet Embassy here, to whom a guarded and private enquiry was addressed. It seems fairly evident, however, that he did tour through Persia, as his account of his journey is too accurate in details to have “been invented.

British Consulate No. 539/20.3 Shiraz SeptemlDer 13th, 1932 Dear Chancery Your No. 29/8-1 of the 2nd. There is in Shiraz a British Indian subject J.F. Y. Saldana who is locally known as ’•Johnny' to the motor fraternity. At the time of Woodward f s alleged journey Saldana was partner in a spare-parts shop, subsequently abandoned, and one lorry. We have questioned Saldna who we think quite genuinely has no recollection of anyone corresponding to Woodward, for whom he arranged transport to Isfahan. There is no company in Shiraz named 'Nissim Lalezar Motor Transport Company' although there is a garage called 'Nissim Yousuf Garage'.

Dear Consulate, With reference to note dated the Seoteniber 2, 1932 from the Chancery, British Legation, Tehran, we have to state that one J. Woodward holding Roumanian Passport No. 361 issued to him at Shangai (China) on July 28, 1931 came to this Vice-Consulate for a transit visa. On oeing questioned he stated that he had travelled from India to Bushire and thence to Shiraz, Isfahan, Tehran and Mohammerah. That he had been robbed twice on the way and been maltreated by robbers and dispossessed of everything he had. He complained bitterly of the treatment he had received in Persia, seemed to be repentant for ever having come to Persia and appeared anxious to return to his own country as soon as possible. He was in possession of about 40 Tomans and some Indian currency.
