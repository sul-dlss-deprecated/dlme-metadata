Dalrympl© Belgrave, Osquire # C.B.B., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. The Chief Engineer, Air Ha adquarters. The Royal Air Force, Habbanieh, Iraq, Dear Sir, The new R .A«F # Ward with ancillary rooms on the first floor of the Government Hospital was completed some time ago and is now in use. It was previously intended that the ground floor Ward below the new Ward should also be used for military personnel but after discussing the matter with the P .M.O., R.A.F. in Iraq, the Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain and the D.O.R.B., it was decided that the other first floor ward, which previously existed, should be utilised for European patients. By this arrangements the Europeans have their / two wards togetiier on the first floor and are separated from the local patients. 2. It is now hig; ly desirable and recommended by the P .M.O. and our own Medical Staff that a kitchen and pantry should be erected on the first floor, on the open roof between the wards, to be used exclusively for cooking Suropean food. The kitchen and pantry can be of light construction and will not bo expensive.3. It was aloe pointed out by the P.M.O. tiiat a mortuary Is essential. We have at present no mortuary in the hospital. A site can be found for this in a corner behind the hospital buildin s. I understand that there is a regulation pattern for such buildin «• 4. It was also sug^eated that a new staircase should be built from the ground to the first floor. This, in my opinion and in the opinion of the D.C.R.E,, is not necessary or practical. The present staircase which Is wide and easy affords direct access to the wards and the first floor is con lected by a bridge with the Administra tive Block, next door, which is again connected by a bridge with the Womens hospital so suitable exits exist which could be used In case of emergency. I donot consider that there is a real need for the additional staircase. 5. I should be obliged if you would favour me with your views on those proposals and inform me whether you approve of the kitchen and pantry and the mortuary bein* built. Yours faithfully, Adviser to the Government. Copy to:- H.B.M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. R.A.F., Iraq. The Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain. The D.C.R.IS. , Bahrain.

Memorandum: - vli In continuation of my letter No. 65-10 dated 8th January 1944, on the subject of medical fees from service patients in the State Eospital, the question y; of costs has been re-exarained by me after a discussion with the State Fedical Officer and Lady Medical Officer and Matron. It is difficult to gaugefuture increases in the cost of living and the cost of maintaining the Service Wards. I suggest however that the R.A.F. might be given the option of either of the following arrangements: 1. a sliding scale as follows 1944 - Service V /ards R j .12/- per day. Private Rooms Rs.18/- per day. 1945 - Service V/ards Bi.14/- per day. 1946 - w ' Ks.16/- ' ^ or 2. Fixed rate of 1 .2 .14/-, per day, for Service Wards and lis. 18/- per day, for Private Rooms till the end of the war. The cost to the Government per day varies very considerably throughout the year according to the number of patients in the ward^being considerably higher when the patients are few.£ D.O. No.C/190, Political Agoncy, Bahrain, 24th January, 1944. My dear Belgravo, I was under the impression that you did not propose to make any alteration in the rates quoted in your letter No.65-10 of January the 8th, ana I therefore addressed the Services informing them that your charges had been increased, from the 1st of January, and would in future be Ps.15/- a day for officers in private rooms and hs.12/8/- a day for all ranks when accommodated in the two general wards. I enclose for your information a coDy of my letter. - i 2, If you prefer it I will again address the Services but you may consider it more advisable to leave matters as they are at present and, if necessary introduce the Rs.14/- a day rate from the 1st of January 1945 on much the same linos as the ^.12/8/- rate is being introduced this year. v ou s sincerely.

At the time when the Service V/ard was being built the P. /.D. was engaged on works for the R.A.F. in Moharraq and elsewhere and it may be possible that some of these stores referred to in the letter- 2 - were for use in other R .A .F. works. The only record which we have of stores being supplied by the R.A.F. is of 160 bags of cement which were used for building the Mortuary at the hospital, 4, Regarding future terms for the use of the wards etc. by the R.A.F., it is the desire of His Highness Shaikh Sulman that these wards should be available for use by Service personnel for the duration of the war under the arrangements which now exist.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (numerous incumbents), the Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) and the State Medical Officer in Bahrain. The correspondence and other papers cover matters such as: arrangements for the reassignment of wards for RAF personnel; charges to be made for food, medicine and medical services, including increases to these charges in response to the rising cost of living during the war; expansion of hospital facilities, including installation of air conditioning and the construction of a mortuary, paid for by the Air Ministry, with arrangements for eventual reimbursement by the Bahrain Government. A breakdown of the complete cost per month for the provision of inpatients’ services, dated 19 December 1944 is included in the file (folio 33).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000ac#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
