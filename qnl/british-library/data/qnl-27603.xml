Repeated to Minister of State Cairo saving Confidential, I am becoming somewhat concerned over the delay that has occurred in connection with the appointment of a sucessor to the late U.S.Minister here.. As the matter stands, the U.S. are represented by a second secretary who, although a talented linquist, lacks experience and carries little weight.. He is assisted by two young Consular Officers of a somewhat raw and uncouth type and generally speaking the U.S.,. Legation gives an unfortunate impression. Lven native servants are ill clad and dirty with manners that leave something to be desired. The whole institution needs pulling together and smartening up. 2. Question of U.S. representation , is I think of growing importance. Numbers of Americans [1 grp omitted] and civil entering the country seem likely to increase especially now that lease-lend has been extended to Iraq and there will be many supply and other problems to be solved. Apart from this there is I am afraid bound to be certain amount of squabbling and friction between the British authorities and commercial interests on the one hand and invading Americans on the other hand. Mr Kauffman, the lease-lend expert attached to the U.S, Embassy at Angora who has been spending a few days in Bagdad after visiting Cairo and Basra, spoke seriously to the counsellor on this point. He observed that while many American newcomers had been hypercritical, tactless and provocative, he feared that there had also been faults on the other side especially amongst the long established British commercial elements. The situation would require careful and intelligent handling* I entirely agree and a good U.S.minister here would be of great help. Under existing conditions the U.S. Charg6 d' Affaires seems to be largely ignored by his compatriots e.g. the Wheeler Mission. 3. I do not know if anything can be^done but I . think you should know the facts.
