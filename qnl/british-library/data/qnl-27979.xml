Our proposal that telegrams to the Grovernraents of India and Pakistan might he sent by Diplomatic Wireless rather than Cable and Wireless was put forward as a measure of economy which would indeed be very considerable so far as this Office's Vote is concerned, as it might amount to as much as 510,000 a year. It is true that, as the Foreign Office point out in their letter of 18th March, this would need to be set against the decrease in revenue to the nationally owned Cable and Wireless but even so on financial grounds alone the proposal could probably be justified. The technical and operational difficulties, however, revealed by the Foreign Office letter of 18th March are considerably greater than we had expected and should I think be the determining factor. The Foreign Office obviously do not want to take on this extra commitment and I do notthink that we should press them particularly since there is a paoeibility that if conditions in India deteriorate an increased strain will be placed on our D. W.S. link with the High Commissioners and their outstations. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is attached. Mr. Pope for any comments. Jrnd-i- 31«3»4q« tii 'SijH (h - j . 5 APR 194SHr. Harrison.

Dear Janes, In order to judge the value of a money-saving idea I have in mind, it would be useful to know how the £ 3,300 in this a/c* is made up. Would it be too much to ask if one of your comptometer girls could extract the total amount for Foreign, Delhi and Karachi and UKCOM Delhi and Karachi. Separate figures for Delhi and Karachi are not required. jd A- A. ccpL Yours, A.H.P. 18.2.48. Dear Pope, I am replying in Janes’s absence.

London, S#f. 1 • Ext.5649/¥i 5 4PR I9W 5l(j(V (H 1 a jk L h' Jr G OLPIiJEI 7 f IaL Llar^y thanks for your letter of 18th March regarding the suggestion that telegrams from this Office to the Governments of India and Pakistan might be carried by the Diplomatic ■Yireless Service. This suggestion was put forward on the grounds of economy but as you point out such a saving must be set off against decrease in revenue to the nationally owned Gable and Wireless. In view of this^and more particularly of the difficulties in handling the additional traffic revealed by your letter we feel that it would be better if the suggestion made in my From letter of 5th March were shelved. /our own point of view much the most important thing to ensure ia the present ri PQuiftqtanoes^ is the adequacy of / our\ \ our communications between this Office and our High Commissioners in India and Pakistan and between them and their various outstations. I am sending a copy of this letter to Beighton. Unless, however, yourself or the Treasury so desire^it would hardly now seem necessary to have any discussion on the matter in the immediate future. W. A. K. WAKWSOWDear Harrison^ I sSitl ui ^ m, fe been so long* r eplying to yo ur letter of oth Larch^. but 1 have been sick. At the present moment, and with the staff we have available in India and Pakistan, we could not undertake the whole of the commitment which you now suggest, but we could undertake half of it, provided always that the existing traific levels between Karachi, Delhi and London are likely to remain at their present level, i.e. the total commitment would be limited to approximately 30,000 groups per month plus the present average load. As promised in the' exchange of letters between oir orme Sargent and »oir Archibald 0alter of 27th and 31st October last, we are recruiting additional operators for your requirements and in a short time, probably three or four months, we should be able to start to build up from the -additiona l s 30,000 groups which we could accept now up to your requirements of 60,000 groups plus the present average load. Lay I add that, in considering- communications with places like Delhi and Karachi, it must always be borne in mind that these wireless stations exist not only as a link with London but are also the control stations for the various- out-stations such as Peshawar, Lahore, etc., etc. Their totar capacity, therefore, mus t F. a. K. Harrison Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office.must ta^e into consideration the amount of traffic which the^ have to clear between these out-stations. Ly observations above pre-suppose that there is likely to be no increase either in the number of out-stations or in the traffic to be hai died by the control stations at Delhi ana Karachi'With such out-stations. So much for the technical and operational aspects of the matter. I think, hovever, that the time is ripe when we should have a further discussion with the Treasury in regard to the present require ment for communications on your behalf to India and Pakistan and'as regards the future. It would not be unreasonable to suppose that the Treasury see some way further than the bare fact of the saving which accrues from the use of private service communications such as the Diplomatic Wireless service, as' against the use of public service communications such as Caoie and Wireless, It mu;, De that the Treasury would feel that the Diplomatic Wireless Service ought to operate strictly within the limits of its designed purpose, i.e. the provision of communications for the Foreign service. If this were extended to cover Dominions and Commonwealth requirements on a'wide basis, there might be considerable financial repercussions on the nationally owned Cable and Wireless Company. I am sure that.., while the pie sent relatively unsettled conditions in India and Pakistan prevail, and while the local communications networks beyond Cable and Wireless terminal points are likely to be disturbed and ineffectual, the Treasury would wish tc ensure continuity of the present plan, but I am not at all sure that they v/ould be anxious to do so indefinitely or on any wider basis than that of the present day. Before going any furthei , therefore, with the increased commitment for which you are asking, i think we should have a word Wxth heighten, % J a cjl Jgl lur— ' / Yours sincerely3® COPY FOP.
