Re - the Shaikh - is agreeable to having t i a Post Office in his town, but requests that stamps oe superimposed 'Sharjah' and requests that a subsidy oe given to him! 2. There would appear to be 2 ways in which postal J arrangements can be arranged for at Sharjah. Either ti e Manager of the branch Office at Dubai can undertake the work, or alternatively the tgent of the Imperial Airways at Sharjah could &amp; be authorised to act as a Branch Postmaster. I suggest that you communicate with the Postmaster at Dubai, and with Imperial Airways, and obtain their views, and the other details regarding expenditure involved would seem to be matters for your Department ; to decide. Tx/en I receive a concrete proposal from y r ou as to which of the above arrangemen,s you wish, I would make the matter up with Uie Shaikh. 3. In conclusion I venture to point out that any delay- in the establishment of postal arrangements at Sharjah, which may ocour, would have been obviated if your Department had taken up the matter in reasonable time before the Imperial Airways began to p&amp;x operate at Sharjah.

He had been to see me before my visit to sharjah on the 14th and 15th i»ecember 1932 and i had made such enquiries as were possible on a flying visit. i gathered that the present postal official at uubai merely collects and distributes letters but does not even keep postage stamps, i understand that there is a certain demand for parcel facilities and for the sale of stamps locally, i also gathered that proper postal facilities would lead to a considerable use of the Post office. a ascertained from Mr.Jajies,the superintendent of the imperial airways station at sharjah,that he had already had experience of doing Postal work ^of all kinds; at dask and that he would be willing to take on similar work at sharjah. ± understand that he received an allowance of ks. 50 /- per month at jask and would probably want the same allowance at sharjah. ne told me that people often came from uubai to get stamps from him as the Postal official in uubai did not sell them. i mentioned the possibility of getting Mr.daaes to take on the Postal work to the inspector and also informed him generally of the information mentioned above, ne seemed to think that there might be some political objection to opening an office at sharjah but i said that i had not sufficient experience of the xrucial uoast to answer the question off-hand, and that he should proceed to sharjah,see things for himself there and report with his recommendations to his Postal superior who would then pass it on to the nesidency for such action as might be necessary. ± impressed on him that it was no good doing things in a hurry. i personally think that the best arrangement would be to open a Post uffice at the imperial airways Station in sharjah and keep the present arrangement for uubai but allowing theu.u.NOi/3£3 * political Agency 9 Jahraln, ^*0 ?2nd Oneember 1932• My dear rowle, you will remember that Mr.badal i/aa,Inspector of j^oet Offices,Karachi,came to see me during ycur visit to Bahrain and you said that there 'yrg nn objection to hie g'olng to i&lt;ubai and ^harjah in connect5.on ?.

I said that the best course seemed to be that after he had made his enquiries on the spot, he should submit his recommendations to his postal superiors, who would then make proposals to the Hon’ble the political Resident. 6. as a result of my flying visit to bharjah and i/ubai, i should be inclined to think that a rost office at the inperial Airways Station would be useful as there scans to2 * be Borne demand t'or parcel and other facilities, and that the present postal official shoald continue to work as a collector and distributor of letters and possibly as a seller of stampsr 6# I am, also, handicapped, by the fact that I have none of the old correspondence about postal arrangements at i/abai and on the rrucial Coast and it ’.rould be convenient, if there is no objection, if i may see any files that there may be on the subject* lours sincerely, The non*hie Lieut.Colonel T*C«W # Fowle,C«B*E* 9 political Resident in the Persian Gulf, •jushire. !/^ &lt;Lr\ ' 35 ''C'oV oLc^ S-£-3&lt;Jjlk_» ''vrrtrvj—^-o &lt;^-^Vi3 VCsr *-* u - i % .. • ^ ^ - • ° c^O^'O-U^ eT ^A^JV f****-* '-^ cr—-~*^e-cS v^* &lt;1^&gt;U&gt;L-^ v\&lt;r cr&gt;.j-l» '^^*j\fyC&gt;\2&gt; ^LjLMx* No. 46 Dented 19th January 1933.

The Indian Postal Deportment have no Interest to incur this extra expenditure unless the post office Is- 2 - ccmsidered necessary from the political point of view and the Foreign and Political Department are prepared to provide a guarantee against loss. The present financial position precludes our giving such an undertaking and ordinarily we would have expressed our agreement with the arrangement originally suggested by the Director-General. As however you have already informed the Sheikh of Shargah that it is proposed to open a post office there, the Govermaent of India would be glad to know whether you can without embarrassment manage to drop the proposal for a post office and obtain Sheikh's concurrence in the arrangement originally proposed.

Subjecti- Postal arrangements at Shargah. With reference to your Express letter No. 10-5^/32-11, dated the 23rd October 1933, I have the honour to state that the Imperial Airways Agent at Shargah who was again consulted in the matter, is not now agreeable to act a£ Postmaster on a monthly allowance of Rs. 30/-. The Manager, Imperial Airways Ltd. Karachi, also does not allow his local agent at Shargah to undertake the work. 1 enclose copies of communications received from the Station Superintendent,. Imperial Airways Ltd. Shargah and the Manager, Imperial Airways Ltd., Karachi, in this connection and solicit your further orders. Copy of a communication No. TCS/ltfMM/1200, dated 20th October 1933, from the Imperial Airways Ltd. Karachi, to the Superintendent of Post Offices, Karachi. With reference to your letter of the 20th September ref. No. A. 391, in which you request that arrangements may be made so that our Station Superintendent at Shargah should act as the postal authority as Shargah on the conditions you mention. 1 am afraid that due to the normal station work which our Station Superintendent has to perform it would not be very practicable for him to also act as Postmaster, and in particular to attend to the collection and delivery of mails in Shargah village, because, as you are aware there are certain restriction on our employees going into the village. Another difficulty in the way of our being able toassist you is that in the near future we propose to alter our arrangements at Shargah so as to provide relief staff being sent there at certain periods of the year, and there would probably not be the kind of continuity in our staff that you might wish to have so far as the postal arrangements are concerned. If it is possible for you to make other arrangements, I am to suggest that this would appear to be preferable and perhaps you would please give further consideration to the matter. We appreciate that you should have asked us to do this work for you, and we can assure you that we are anxious to co-operate with you and assist in any way that is reasonably possible. Copy of a letter Ho.WJ/884, dated the 14th October 1933, from the Station Superintendent, Imperial Airways* -^td. Sharjah to the Superintendent, Post Offices, Karachi. In reply to your letter No. A. 391, dated the 20th ultimo, I have the honour to inform you that I shall be pleased to assist you and the public of Shai^ah in performing the post office work at this station, in terms of my agreement with the Inspector of Post offices, a copy of vhich is append ed herewith. You will observe that it was agreed that Rs, 20/- would be accepted if the work to be done was on the same lines as that done by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s agent, which was in connection with the sea mail unregistered articles. If the air mail were to be included than the amount should be raised to Rs. 30/- per mensem. If registration money orders etc. were required, then the remuneration should be enhanced accordingly. I would remind you that some years back when the post office at Jask was controlled by the Indian Government, one of the Indo-European Telegraph Department officials performedperformed the duties of the Postmaster, and I was one of them, having held the charge of the Jask post office for about four years. At that time an allowance of Rs. 50/- per mensem was sanctioned for the work, which included registration, money orders, parcels etc. Later on the allowance was raised to Rs. 75/- per mensem. The public T*ho took advantage of the post office consisted of about fifteen telegraph employees and say about thirty from the town. The work was by no means arduous and took on an average of one hour a day to perform. In the case of Shargah it must be remembered that the town consists of a population, of at least one thousand, comprising of Arabs, Persians, Mekranis and Indians. There are at least one hundred and fifty small shops besides several pearls merchants. Further as soon as the post office is opened at Shargah, the people of Dubai which is only ten miles from Shargah, will take advantage of the air mail post, which is going to throw extra work on my shoulders. Therefore due consideration should be given when you expect me to cater for both Shargah and Dubai. Under the circumstances, I cannot see any way to doing the work unregistered and registered acticles for less than Rs, 50/- per mensem. If approved I shall also undertake to booking of money orders and parcels and in general perform the work as is done at any branch post office. In conclusion I beg to point out that the work done by the British India Steam Navigation Company^ agent at Dwbai for Rs. 20/- per mensem, consists of one mail per week; whereas at Shargah, it will be one sea and two air mails per week. Copy of a letter dated the 2nd January 1933, from the Station Superintendent, Imperial Airways Ltd. Shargah, to the Inspector of Post Offices, Karachi. This is to state that the undersigned is agreeable tor to perform the duties of the postmaster at Shargah on the same lines as hitherto carried on at Dubai by the agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company at a remuneration of Rs # 20/- per mensem, but if the duties include air mails then in respect of the extra work, that the amount be raised to Rs. 30/- per mensem. Should at a later date, it is decided to perform full ^futies of a post office i.e. registration, money order etc., that the scale of age pay be enhanced acco rdingly. !r? ft lxCopy of express Letttr No.i5b4 dated the ^Oth duly 1933 f rom Political Hesident iiushire to foreign bi ml a.

Sir Samuel Hoare understands that the objections previously seen by the Manager, Imperial Airways, Limited, at Shargah, to the Imperial Airways Station Superintendent at Shargah undertaking postal work arose from the misapprehension that the Station Superintendent’s duties would involve frequent visits to Shargah village. It appears, however, that this would not in fact be necessary, and it is now understood from informal conversation with Imperial Airways Limited, that if the Government of India v/ould agree to appoint a clerk to run a small Post Office at Skargah, Imperial Airways, Limited, would see no objection to their Station Superintendent undertaking to supervise the postal work for an allowance of Rs.30 per mensem, and that they would be prepared to advise the Station Superintendent accordingly. w 'he Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla.2. In view of this the Secretary ox State would he glad to learn whether the Government of India would now he prepared to agree to the appointment of a clerk: and to the grant of an allowance of Rs.30 per mensem to Imperial Airways Station Superintendent for supervising the work. It seems prima facie prohahle that a Post Office established on this basis would he run at a satisfactory profit to the Government of India, vrhile the Political Resident’s demi-official.

The Post Office here, however, will not accept mail packets to Dubai as there is no Post Office at Sharjah. We write to ask whether the Indian Postal Autho rities could be approached in this matter to enable the Post- . master here to prepare a weekly packet for despatch to Sharjah, in the same manner as the London mail bag. As you are aware, considerable amount of correspondence is exchanged betwen Dubai and Sharjah, and Bahrein. We would also draw your atention to the fact that the 7 [postage on letters from here to the United Kingdom is based on the same rate as charged in India. We do not consider this a fair deal, in view of the fact that Bahein, according to the air route, is 1089 miles closer to U.K. than India. Moreover, It V) If (tfle believe, the amount paid by the Indian Post Office to the Imperial Airways Ltd., for the carriage of Bahrein mails to the United Kingdom is less than v/hat they pay for the carriage of Indian mails to the same destination. We shall be glad to hear that something can be done in this matter also. Yours faithfully,jj ^ H ^ Extract from letter Ko.

This station is notably the worst from the point of view of climate and general facilities# Consequently mails are a very important item in our lives# Under existing air mail arrangements we have to despatch our homeward bound letters via either Bahrein or Basrah; all our outcoming letters are delivered at Basrah for subsequent transmission by sea# This, you will readily see, entails a considerable delay# Our ships spend the greater part of their time in the Southern Section of the Persian Gulf, and frequently visit Shargah, and if it were possible to despatch and receive air mails at Shargah a great saving of time could be effected# This is at present impossible, as there is no post office at Shargah# The technicalities of mail arrangements between Imperial Airways and the General Post Office are, of course, unknown to me, and I am therefore unable to put forward any constructive remarks for overcoming the difficulty, but it will be most highly appreciated by the 450 officers and men serving out here under very trying conditions if some means can be devised which will enable them to receive and despatch their air mails via Shargah# Perhaps/mmammmmm 2o Perhaps some similar arrangements could he made as in the case of our ordinary sea route mails, which are posted on hoard H.M* Ships and placed in sealed hags addressed to the Postmaster General, London, using English stamps. There is a Post Office at Dehai - the next state to Shargah - hut though ordinary letters can he posted there they will not accept air mails. Under the existing conditions it not infrequently happens that one of our ships has to steam hundreds of miles (e.g. to Bahrein) when it is necessary to despatch urgent official letters hy air. I am sure youwLll readily see what a great difference it would make to he ahle to receive and despatch air letters at Shargah* All H«M* Ships concerned were on this station while the air route was heing established, and were, and are, instrumental in making its development possible from the standpoint of security.

Sir, /I I have the honour to refer to your Express Letter No.2800/14/222 dated the 29th December 1934 regarding the establishment of a Post office at Sharjah. 2. on the 4th March 1936 during my recent visit to Sharjah I spoke to the Shaikh about the question of accommodation for a post office. He said that he did not think that he had any suitable house except those let out to people, but in the afternoon he told me that he had found an house which I went to see. in the meantime I had already seen a ware-house belonging to the Hesidency Agent (who has no room in his own house) and situated just outside his house, on which he was prepared to construct two living rooms, a bathroom, latrine and kitchen. He asked for a rent of Rs. 100/- a month, but would, I think, accept Rs.60/- a month. The Shaikh would also want rent, but said that he would put the house into good order.••• • •/Q order and make certain necessary alterations# Both places are at the edge of the Creek, but the Shaikh's house, which is near the Customs' wharf, is more commodious and has a small vailed-in compound. 3. In the morning I had put it to the Shaikh that, as he and his people wanted a post office, they might, I thought, provide a building, but the shaikh said that he had hoped for a subsidy from the post office, but that as Government had stated that that would not be possible, he would not ask for it (see his letter No.412 dated the 23rd March 1933 to the Secretary to the Honourable the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushirej, but, as he would have to turn people out to provide an house, he v/ould have to ask for rent, ‘jftie house which he showed me in the afternoon appeared to be only partially occupied, but the shaikh will have to spend a fair sum in repairs and alterations. I think that, if the house is properly repaired and as the shaikh will be required to undertake responsibility for the safety of the post office ( a safe would be wanted as a precaution against an ordinary theft), it would be sound to pay him a small rent. Kven if he v/ere to supply a post office room, there would still remain the question of accommodation for the clerk. I would suggest Rs.50/- a month, which would include a good post office room on ground level with a store-room for papers, and two rooms (one of them a large upstairs room) and an open msglis, which could be made into a third room, for the accommodation of the postal clerk. A suitable washing place, kitchen and latrine would be made and, as mentioned above, there is a small walled-in compoundcompound. Although it is about s.’OO or 400 yards from the Residency Agent* s house, I do not think that much risk is involved as the shaikh wants the post office and will be required to accept responsibility. Letter, that is to say, that the best plan is to ask the Government of India to send a clerk of sufficient standing to undertake the whole work, I have explained the position regarding accommodation above and agree with you that the clerk should be provided with a safe. Arrangements might be made for him to hand over any accumulation of cash beyond his needs to the Residency Agent, who could utilize it towards meeting the payments to the shaikh for the Airways station* 4.

If I may suggest it* I think, that it would be a good thing, if you have the time, to ask the Shaikh to show you the house and to enquire whether he will give it without rent as the post Office is to his advantage. I think that a suitable compromise might be for us to give a lun 5 &gt; sum down for the necessary repairs and alterations if he gives the house rent free. 2* 'Abdullah bin Paris has bought a launch here for fh#2,000/~ and I gather that the idea is that Sharjah wishes to carry mails between Sharjah and Dibai.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No:5 v ;9 dated the 18th June 1935. 2. I visited Bharjah on board H.&amp;.S Fo^ey on the 26th ^une 1935• The Shaikh came on board at once and was extremely friendly. 3. After returning his call ashore I took up the question of the Post Office. Xhe Shaikh refused to consider giving a house for « Post Office rent free and so I told him in quite a friendly E&amp;nner that it did not matter and we concluded the conversation. As I was leaving he drew ae on one side and said that he was prepared to give anything Government wanted provided dealings were direct with him and not conducted through the Residency Agent or his family and that he would see me later in the day at the aerodrome* 4. The Bhalkh had ex ressed his willingness for the sailors to go ashore and water; the Imperial Mrwaya aeroplane land at Sharjah that evening and he Joined us on the aerodrome. He took me on one side and there told m that the only suitable house for a Post Office was the one which he had pointed out to Colonel ~*och and which is the only place of which the Residency “-gent ap roves. This house is situated on the customs pier and Is about half a mile from the Residency Agent’s house. «fter discussion the /ShaikhShaikh gave &amp;© the attached letter* In that letter there are tv*o conditions* I aa of opinion that the w haikh would give the Post Office unconditionally but the conditions he made seem to me to be so reasonable that I raised no objection to them* If, however, you consider them objectionable I do not anticipate any difficulty in making such arrangements as you deum fit* 5# With regard to th^ question of security* I purposely avoided any specific mention of the subject. 1‘he u naikh is willing to have a Post Office and, indeed, wants a Post Office provided, of course, it is going to be no xpense to him. In his letter is implied the &amp;h&amp;ikh f s responsibility for the security and safety of the Post Office and its ersonnel* I am sure that tae &amp;haiKh has no intention of placing guards on it but he will, I am sure, ensure its safety* If we are going to Insist on guards the whaikh will ask us to meet their pay* I, therefore, am of opinion that the question of security should be regarded as quite separate from the ^ost Office itself* 6.

I said that there were various points to be considered# The first was that he had promised a house which he had shown to me and to which he would make the necessary repairs and so on# I said that Government were prepared to meet him by giving a rent for the house should they find that the Post Office was making profits. fa Twrt'' I then said that Waa important matter was security as the Government would naturally have a certain amount of money and some stamps in the Post Office and it would also be necessary to ensure the safety of the Postmaster# It would be necessary for him to undertake their security. The Shaikh asked what sort of guards would be required for the Post Office. I replied that it was for him as Ruler to provide what was necessary for the protection of the Post Office but I thought that it would probably be sufficient if he were to detail some ofhis ferjA-o 1 for the duty of looking after the Post Office. 4 ■ He said that he would undertake the protection of the Post Office but that he wanted that the mails should be carried in his motor car or launch for which he would be paid the usual charges# He said that he did not mean light packages which could be sent by the hand of a messenger but that in the case of heavy packages which required special carriage he should have the providing of the transport. He wanted to carry the mails from and to Dibai. I said that if it was a question of providing transport within Sharjah limits the matternan I J.7 ) !&gt;0 - 2 - could no doubt be arranged but that if he wanted to carry the mails from Dibai to Shctrjah it would fce necessary for him to come to some agreement with the Shaikh of Dibai about it. I said that I was not prepared to promise him that he should have the carriage of mails to and from Dibai and ^hen find ttet shaikh Sa 1 id bin Maktum was not prepared to allow his launch or motor car to come there. Shaikh sultan emphasised on two or three occasions that he did net want to make big chaiges but just to be paid the ordinary charges for transport for any transport which he supplied for the Post Office, 3 # At 20.00 hours on the same day the Shaikh sent his man, 'Abdullah bin Faria, to say that in connection with the Post Office he wished to carry the mails from Sharjah to Dibai and from Dibai to Sharjah. I explained to 'Abdullah bin Paris that the question of carrying mails within Sharjah territory, that is to say, from the steamer to the shore or from the Post Office to the mahattah, could easily be arranged, but that I was not prepared to undertake to make the Shaikh of Dibai allow them to send launches and motor cars for mails from Dibai if he did not wish them to,dnd that it was for them to come to an agreement with him. I emphasised that it was the Shaikh who wanted the Post Office and that it was for him to make arrangements with the Shaikh of Dibai. 'Abdullah bin Paris said that the Shaikh of Dibai would not agree for the carriage of mails to Dibai from /3- ) * from Sharjph £8 on one or two occasions he refused a Sharjah launcn/jbo take the Dibai mails from the tm steamer at Sharjah to Dibai and sent his launch to take them, I replied that in that case they should make some arrangement with the Shaikh of Dibai by which khs Sharjah launch could bring the Sharjah mails from Dibai and that a Dibai launch should take the Dibai mails from Sharjah. (The point seems to be that steamers call once a week at Shrrjah and once a week at Dibai and that the two Rulers must make some amicable agreement about the cerriege of mails between the two ports), ’/bdullah bin Faris seemed doubtful whether the Shaikh of Dibai would accept such an arrangement but 1 do not think that he quite understood what he wanted as he harped for a long time on the •Company* paying double charges O’Ting to a Dibai launch landing the mails at Dibai and a Sharjah launch taking them from there, I ended up by saying that Government were net interested in the Post Office at Sharjah but it was the Shaikh who wanted it. I was not prepared to ask the Shr ikh of Dibai to allow the Shaikh of Sharjah to carry mails within his territory if he (Sharjah) was not prepared to allow the Shaikh of Dibai to carry his mails in Sharjah territory. I ended up by saying that it was useless making a trouble over this matter as otherwise Govern ment might drop the question of having a Post Office in Sharjah altogether. 4. I think the heat thing is to write to the Shaikh at Sharjah putting the position before him.5 / Offiseof the Political AgenJ, Bah rain, on H.'M.S.Lupin (at Um-al-Qaiwain) Dated the bth JNovember iy3b* To Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Raler of Sharjah. After Compliments, You will remember that when I saw you on the bth October 193b equivalent to the bth Rajab 1354, ana again on the 2nd November equivalent to the bth Sha’ban 1354, we discussed the question ol the Post Office which you wish to have at Sharjah. 2. I understand from our conversation that you are ready to undertake full responsibility for the protection of the post Office and Postmaster and to provide the necessary guards* 3* You also said that you would provide the house, which j ou snowed me sometime ago, and make certain alterations and repairs. You have asicea for rent, and the High Government are not prepared to give a rent now, but they have agreed tnat if and when the post Office make sufficient profit in the future, they will oe prepared to pay you a reasonable rent for the house. You mentioned a sum of Rs.50/- a month as a suitable rent when this time comes, and I will recommend to the High Government that this amount is suitable. 4. As the Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident informed you in his letter No.156 dated the 233rd May 1933 the question of the stamps being surcharged ’Sharjah* can be examined later when the Post Office has been established and when it is known among other things how many stamps are used and so on.■/ - 2 - 5# There remains one question which you mentioned to me, that oi the transport of mails# You said that you wished to undertake transport of the mails yourself and you explained to me that you did not mean by this that there was any objection to a messenger of the Post Office cariying any small r^aount of mails, but that if a special launch or a motor car were to be hired that it should be hired from you. You said that you did not require special rates but would be paid the ordinary rates for hiring launches or motors. The mails are ordinarly landed by the B.I.S.N* Company’s Agent at a fort, but I think that it might be possible to agree that, if a special launch or motor is hired,it should be hired from you at the usual rates. 6. You also mentioned the question of carrying the Sharjah mails from Dibai as the steamer calls only at Dibai on the down voyage and said that you would send a motor car to Dibai to bring the maijo from the B.I.S.N.Company*s Agent there and that you would provide guards and undertake responisbility for the safety of the mail., from the time when your guards take it over from the B.I.S.N.Company’s Agent at Dibai to the time when it is handed over to the Postmaster at Sharjab.. I am prepared to recommend this to the High Covemment on the uilderstanding that our friend Shaikh Sa’id bin Miktum of Dibai has no sksskiaa objection to your guards entering Dibai to bring the mails 7. please inform me whether you accept these conditions and if so I will recommend to the Hon’dtle tire Political Resident that a Post Office should be opened as soon as possible in Sharjah.

In the past few months first class mail has changed over from ship car riage to air carriage and if the Shaikh of Sharjah maintains this intransigent attitude we can look elsewhere (i.e. Dubai) for a solution. In the first place, therefore, I suggest that I should be authorised to inform the Shaikh finally and definitely that no ad infinitum guarantee in regard to the down steamers can or will be given* If he is not satisfied with the fact that the steamers do at present call and that the Company have no present intention of altering their programme, then he should be told that the proposal to open a Post Office in Sharjah is finished. The proposal is ior ^is benefit and the benefit of his subjects and not for ours and I see no reason to continue our somev/hat suppliant attitude towards him on this question* room situated on the western side of the Customs and the 4/ Captain A*C* Galloway, I*A*, Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire *4# If the Shaikh of Sharjah gives In when matters are put to him clearly and finally f so much the better. If not then I sugjest we should take up the question of extending the exist ing postal facilities in Dubai. At present Gray Mackenzie’s agent acts as Branch Postmaster* preparing outgoing bags for despatch by sea mail, distributing incoming bags and selling stamps. There is no apparent reason why he should not perform exactly the same functions in respect of the air mail* Since the air mail is carried by flying boats, and will be in all probability for the next five or s even years at least, it should be quite feasible for the agent at Dubai to deal with this work. It may mean a little more expenditure as it will be necessary to arrange transport between the town and the creek where the fly ing boats land, tut that should not amount to very much. 5. So far as we are concerned, the Residency Agent’s mail can very easily be sent in to Dubai and collected from there - in fact most of his stuff already travels by air 5 and as Shar jah town Is very much moribund these days this proposal will not be to the disadvantage of any great number of British Indian ■ subjects and traders. As for the Shaikh of Sharjah himself and his subjects, it is a matter of complete indifference to us whe ther or not they aver receive or can send their mails at all. 6 . I confess I am unable to discover by what arrangement or under whose orders Gray Mackenzie’s agent does act as Branch Postmaster at Dubai, but the fact remains that he does so func tion, and I see no reason for political difficulties if he ex tends his activities to air mails.

As a result of my discussion with Sir Trenchard I mention ed briefly the question of opening a Post Office at Dubai to the Shaikh of Dubai on my last trip there. I did not press the matter then as there were other more important matters on hand, but a few days ago I instructed the Hesidency Agent to take it up more definitely with the Shaikh. I said he was to demand a free building and a guarantee of protection, and I now enclose a copy of a letter which Shaikh Said bin Maktum has written to the Residency Agent, f, / q t 3. In these circumstances I suggest that the Sharjah proposal be dropped permanently and that arrangements now be made to open a Post Office at Dubai. I presume that arrangements for the carriage of first class mail by air will be automatic, and the only other detail to which I need draw attention is the absolute necessity of stationing a Mohammadan Postmactor there.

Ho. 512-14/5 Bated the 26th !'arch 1939. Vy Dear Rushton, Will you please refer to iavidge’s demi-official letter No. F.159-N/38 dated the 9th I arch 1939 to Galloway on the sub ject of the proposed establishment of a Gub Post Office at Dubei. I have the following comments to make. 2. In the first place I am not impressed by the estimate of monthly income. The fact that it is calculated to annas and pies shows clearly enough that it is based solely on previous years* receipts| and it takes no account therefore of the increased traffic which will unquestionably result from the use of the air mail. Surely it will be admitted that even if first class mails are carried only in the flying boats three times weekly in each direction there will necessarily be a considerable increase in income. At the present moment all urgent stuff is made into parcels and carried to and from 3harjah/T)ubai as air freight and this traffic would of course be diverted to the Post Office. Similarly one must exoect useful receipts from money orders and postal orders, and even from the Postal Savings Bank which might well be operated in the absence of any commercial bank at Dubai or Sharjah. 3/- Captain H. P. Rushton, 'X Secretary to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre .3# In the second place I consider that the estimated expenditure for the sub post office is unnecessarily high. I cannot see why the sub-postmaster should be given Hs 55/- per mensem ©s special pay, the same sum as the sub-postmaster in Pahrain receives for operating an infinitely larger office; and it is worth noting that the new medical officer on the Trucial Coast who, judging by relative average pays must be of higher status than a sub-postmaster, is to receive only &amp; 50/- special pay* I would suggest that a saving of Rs 10/- at least can be taken her*©. Then again I cannot see why, with a whole-time sub-post master, It should be necessary to employ a postman. There need be no outside deliveries in Dubai to begin with, window delivery being quite sufficient. As the post office will not have a vast deal of work (to begin with at any rate) the sub-postmaster shoulc be able to carry on by himself without the assistance of a post- 1 man for odd jobs in the office. Here, then, there would be a saving of it&gt; 39/- per mensem. The cost of a runner, his special pay and his conveyance allowance also seem to me to be unnecessarily high. I presume that his job is flierely to carry mail bags to the steamer twice a fortnight and to and from the Imperial Airways* alighting areain the Dubai creek. A local man on a camel would be adequate, and though I have not had time to ascertain definitely what it would cost I think it would be somewhere in the region of ffc 30/- per mensem in all. Altogether I should imagine that one could safely take a saving of Rs 60/- per mensem on the total estimated cost* 4. On the information supplied in the Posts and Telegraphs Department*s note of the 3rd 'ebruary 1939, attached to —— Savidge*s letter, the Postal Department must have made many hundreds (or even thousands) of rupees profit out of Dubai in the past. Why therefore should the External Affairs Depart ment have to guarantee a possible loss --at any rate until some inroad h^s been made on those profits ? But I suppose that such an argument would be vigorously rejected by a 'heads I win, tails you lose' concern like a modern Commercial Depart ment, and I will content myself with saying that I shall be surprised if the margin between expenditure and revenue exceeds Rs 50/- a month, provided expenditure is cut as I suggest. And I hold that there are sound political reasons for our Department to guarantee such a deficit for at least three years, I firmly believe that long before that period has expired the deficit will have been eliminated* Yours sincerely,Would you please refer to Savidge’s demi- official letter Ho .i 1 .159-fl/38, dated the 9th March, 1939, a copy of which has been sent to you direct? 2.

The Political Agent Bahrain also offers various suggestions for effecting a saving in the working of the proposed office but even so it could not be guaranteed C*A«G* iiavidge, J&amp;sq*, Under Secretary to the Govt, of India, /that External Affairs Department, Simlathat the leasee el 11 not exceed the present figure. 4. The Political Resident is accordingly of the Ties that* in the present state of financial strin gency, the proposal is not of sufficient importance to sarrant ashing the Government of India to meet any further possible losses which might result, but he desires me to add that he expresses this opinion without prejudice to any reconsideration of the queati which my be made in the future. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H. D.RU5HT0N y Copy to political Agent, Bahrain.DubaiI believe that ohe present position is that the attitude of the losts and Telegraphs Deparment, v/ho wished the Political Department to guarantee any possible deficit, \Jiile themselves annexing any possible porfit, has brought the matter to a stand still* 2* From my recollection of the Bahrain files, I believe that the monthly expenditure of a sub-office in Dubai was estimated at Rs♦ 170/- or Rs*18G/-; and there v/ould, as you know, be no rent to pay for the post office building. 3.

The Ruler of Sharjah requests that the name of Sharjah is printed on the stamps. The file also contains agreements with Imperial Airways for the delivery of mail, and arrangements for a suitable office at Sharjah. Whilst the Ruler of Dubai is initially against the opening of a Post Office in his town, further discussions develop in 1938 for the opening of a Post Office in Dubai (sketch on folio 208).The principal correspondents are: the Ruler of Sharjah (Shaikh Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī); the Ruler of Dubai (Shaikh Saʻīd bin Maktūm bin Hasher Āl Maktūm); Imperial Airways; the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited; the Superintendent of Post Offices, Lower Sind and Persian Gulf Division, at Karachi; the Director of Post and Telegraphs at Karachi; the Residency Agent at Sharjah (Khan Bahadur Isa bin Latif, and from 1936 Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan 'Amad); the Political Agency at Kuwait; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and the Political Agent at Bahrain.There is some correspondence in Arabic, with English translation, with the Residency Agent at Sharjah, the Ruler of Sharjah and the Ruler of Dubai.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Superintendent of Post Offices, Lower Sind and the Persian Gulf, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000099#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
