BY AIR IvlA I Ii (iaM) Copies by BagJ. 5th March, 1937. Sir, Pith reference to my saving telegram No.20 of February 2 nd, I have the honour to report that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me yesterday and gave me a copy of a letter and counter-draft of the Perso-Iraqi frontier treaty which he had received from the Persian Minister, who returned from Tehran a few days ago. I enclose copies of these papers herein. The copy of the covering letter is a translation from the original Arabic, but the draft of the treat/ is in French, in which language it was given to Dr. Naji. I gather that it has now been decided that the treaty shall be concluded in French. 2. In discussing the Persian draft with me, Dr. Naji said that he had found that in many respects it was an improvement on the Iraqi text. He preferred, for example, the Persian Article 2, especially as it presented the cession of the Abadan anchorage in the form of a frontier adjustment rather than a surrender of Iraqi territory ana thereby avoided a conflict with Article II of the Iraqi constitution. He appreciated, however, that it would be necessary to check the coordinates given, which seemed to extend the anchorage a little to the south,, 3. On the other hand he told me that he had spoken frankly to the Persian Minister about the omission of provision for freedom of passage for the vessels of Iraq’s allies in Article 4 (B) and to the absence of any reference in the draft/ ght Honourable hony Eden, M.C., M. x h, etc . , etc , , etc .1 &amp; draft to the question of the Rooka channel f He had also discussed the omission of any stipulations concerning dredging and navigation such as had been included in Article 4 (c) and letter No. 2 of the Iraqi draft* 4. With regard to the first two points the Persian Minister bad argued'that the dispute to he settled concerned the validity of the Protocol of 1913 and the Procbs-verbaux of the delimitation commission of 1914. Persia was now recognising the validity of these documents and the introduction into the negotiations of any proposals irrelevant to this issue was inappropriate. n e had also warned Dr* Naji that he feared that if the Iraqi Government pressed for the discussion of matters not directly connected W'ith the main issue, the Shah would probably be annoyed and might even break off the negotiations: 5. As regards conservancy and navigation, the Persian Minister had said that the Persian Government expected Iraq, in accordance with her promises, to conclude an agreement for the joint control of the Shatt and, as it was hoped that this agreement would be brought into operation soon after the ratification of the frontier treaty itself, it was unnecessary to have special treaty arrangements for the short period which might intervene between the coming into force of these two instruments. He had also explained that Persia would naturally ask Iraq to carry on the existing executive services in the shatt as the Persian Government had no organisation or machinery for undertaking work of this kind. 6 . Dr. Naji concluded his account of his talk by saying that he thought there w r as a good deal in vhat Mudhaffar Alam had said, but that there were one or two legal points concerning his remarks on the Persian attitude towards the limitation of the negotiations to the question of the validity of/of the Protocol of 1913 and the Proces-verbaux of the delimitation commission of 1914 on which he would like the advice of His Majesty’s Government. He proposed therefore to set out these points in a letter which he would send to me with all haste.. 7. I said that I was sure that you would give all advice possible. I also expressed misgiving about the arguments used by the Persian Minister both in connexion with the Rooka channel and the administration of the Shatt, and explained at some length the importance of the Rooka channel to Iraq and the great interest which Iraq had in securing, in the treaty, legal and physical safeguards for the passage of British Government vessels through the Shatt. My arguments followed familiar lines and I need not weary you by reseating them here. 8 . I received Mr, Naji’s letter in the evening and I enclose a copy herein. His question seems to me to beg the point, since the real issue is not whether the status quo at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab would be affected by the conclusion of a treaty on the lines of the Persian counter- draft, but whether it is not essential to take the opportunity of these negotiations to remove the doubts concerning Iraqi sovereignty over the Rooka channel which exist under the two documents, the validity of which is about to be recognised. Nevertheless, I should be grateful for a reply to Dr. Naji’s question, to which he evidently attaches considerable importance. 9. Prom the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, the main defects of the Persian draft are, I think, to be found in Article 4 (B) and Article 5. In Article 4 (s), though there is apparently an intention to provide freedom of passage for Iraqi Government vessels through those parts of the/the Shatt which Will be under Persian sovereignty, no similar right of Passage is given to British ships, nor is it even provided that British Government vessels shall be able to pass through Iraqi waters without paying dues. This section is also open^to the criticism applied to the Iraqi draft Article 4 (b) in paragraph 4 (d) of your telegram No. 35 of February 15th. 10 - - AS regards Article although the positive stipulation that both sides shall conclude a conservancy and navigation convention does not, I think, conflict with the interests of His Majesty's Government, it appears to me that, in its present form, this article might be interpreted in a manner to preclude the Iraqi Government from proposing, later on, that Great Britain should be a third party to the convention. Indeed, I venture to suggest that it has been drafted with this particular object in view. 11 * Nevertheless, Dr. Naji is clearly very well dispose to the Persian counter-draft, which he is likely to accept as the basis for further discussions, and he seems to have been much impressed by Mudhaffar Alam’s arguments about the real point at issue. In fact, his anxiety to conclude the treaty threate.is, I fear, to cloud his judgment. Hc„. has asked me to give him the comments of His Majesty's Government as early as possible. I shall therefore be glad if you will send me by telegram your observations on the points to which I have referred above and on any other articles of the Persian counter-draft which you may think it desirable that I should communicate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 13. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. I have, etc. (Signed) Archibald Clark Herr.Enclosure in Bagdad despatch No. 98 dated 5.3.57.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C/5/17 dated 4th February, 1937, transmitting a draft Frontier Settlement Treaty. I beg leave to bring to Your Excellency’s notice the fact that clause (c) of Article 4 of the draft does not agree 'with the negotiations and correspondence hitherto conducted with a view to the settlement of disputes and the drawing up of agreements for the purpose. Therefore and in order to obviate future misunderstanding between the two parties, I have prepared a new draft in the French language, of which you will find a copy enclosed herewith, and which, if accepted, will render needless an exchange of special notes between us. Fundamentally, the present new draft agrees with the one which you were so good as to transmit to me, and as the contemplated agreement must he registered with the Secretariat of the League of Nations, the draft has been drawn up in the French language. I am most willingly prepared to furnish Your Excellency with any explanations as you may wish to ask for concernin it. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency my highest consideration and esteem, His Excellency Doctor Naji al Asil, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Royal Iraqi Government, Bagdad.' —^ ' % Enclosure in Bagdad desnatch No. 98 dated 5. 3,37. ♦ Ministry for Foreign if fairs, No. 471 Baghdad* ’ Iraq. Datei 4th March, 1937. My dear Ambassador, Referring to our conversation this morning concerning the rronosed Irac-Iran Boundary settlement, I should he very grateful if you could obtain telegraphically the answer of the British Government to the question set out in paragraph 2 Below in the light of the Iranian counter-draft, a cony of which I handed to you this morning. In explanation of my desire to have this information, I should inform you that the Iranian attitude to the proposed settlement, as explained to me verbally by the Iranian Minister, is as follows: Iraq went to the League on the basis of the validity of the Protocol of 1913 and the Proces-verbaux of 1914. Iran denied their validity. Iran is now accepting their validity and, subject to the modification at Abadan, the boundary therein described, which will thereby be incontestably established. Iran would con sider any new proposals going beyond the acceptance of those documents, e.g. defining more clearly the position of the approaches to the Shatt, as raising a new question and, therefore, inappropriate. 3. In view of this attitude of the Iranian Government, and of the desire of the Iraqi Government to reach a settle ment, even if that settlement does not explicitly deal with the approaches to the Shatt beyond what appears in the /documents is Excellency Sir Archibald John Kerr Clark Kerr, K.C.M,G., Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Embassy, Bagdad.documents of 1913-14, the Iraqi Government would he glad of the earliest possible answer from the British Government to the following ouestion; In view of the provisions of the Protocol of 1913 and the Proces-verbaux of 1914, is it sufficiently clear that, if Iraq and Iran accept by a treaty substantially in the form of the Iranian counter-draft the validity of these documents (subject to the modification at Abadan), the status quo at the mouth of the Shatt and in its anorcaches is confirmed? Or, will Iran have any new legal basis to claim part of the mouth and the aoorcaches or to make new? claims in resoect of them? Is this question really material in view of the intention of both Parties to enter into a navigation convention and the readiness of the Iraqi Government to express this intention in tbe Boundary treaty? I am, my dear Ambassador, Yours sincerely. (Sgd. ) Pa ji al Asil.COPY (E 1386/73/34) BY AIR MAIL - K.L.W. British EmbfesSy* Bagdad. 5th March, 1937 My dear Baggallay, Vi/ith reference to my despatch No. 98 of March 5th, I am sending you herewith a copy of a note on the Persian counter-draft of the frontier treaty prepared by McDougall for his minister. I have not had time to examine it in detail, but it seems to put forward a number of sound suggestions. X am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure to Seymour at Tehran. - Yours ever, (Intld.) A.C.K. H.L. Baggallay Ksq.3rd March, 193 y. f***~'\ 9) IR/^Nl.r,W JJRAFT Oh ’HOrTTIhR G OITVx^MTION iN IRAN .AND I_NA\. 1 . I have now examined the Iranian draft. The most notable defect: are (a) the inconsistency of the description of the boundary at Abadan; (b) the omission of anything to show that for the purposes of the Treaty the Shatt runs to the open sea; (c) the omission of any provision for other than Iraqi war vessels to pass through Iranian waters, and nothing is s. id about- time of war; (d) the omission of any right for Iraq to carry out dredging etc. until a Convention is conc 1 uded 9 and after its termination ; (e) the omission of any reference to the approaches to the Shatt. The follow ing points se riatim appear to me to require consideration: (1) The preamble, however true to fact, is not as delicate in feeling as our preamble which is preferable, if the point is thought worth discussing. The word 'Treaty' is prefcrabIe to 'Coavention'. ( 2 ) In Art. 1 (a) the description of the Protocol is not accurate. Our is. If the parties to the Protocol must oe mentioned, then Great Britain and Russia must be mentioned also. I suggest reverting to our Art. 1 (a). (3) In Art. 1 (b) the date should read 1913-1914. ( 4 ) Art. 1 does not get us out of the constitutional difficulty (See my Opinion of yesterday, March 2nd; as clearly as my suggested re-draft, but the Iranian draft is better than ours in that the ''’modification'' refers, not to the boundary, but to the Protocol-and Proces-verbaux, documents which the two Parties arc now agreeing to ores &amp; as/ His excellency t h e M i n i s a e r.(V)/ M8MNH o?) as valia.. This may seem a fine distinction we might accept the Iranian phrasology and* have an answer to constitutional objections. 5 but I think - t the same time 9 (5) Art'.. 2 of the Iranian draft* like Art. 1 ; is better than ours from the constitutional point of view* and strengthens my view expressed above. The mode, however* of describing the boundary differs from ours not only as to the geographical coordinates of the two fixed points on the bank* but by tracing a continuous line from the southerly fixed point out to the thalweg, up the thalweg to a point ''em face do la jetce Ko.l d ? Aba dan u (which i a. K -3 perhaps not sufficiently definite, ; and so co ciic oank aga in at a point ricprth of our point. I am told that the Iranian Government claims an anchorage measured in nautical miles instead of English miles. This additional length may not be important as long as it is claimed at the south wnc. * but apparently we should resist anything further north an No-1 jetty- (Cf. the British Ambassador’s letter para- 4), This is* of course, a poiat for surveyors and other tech nical experts and must be jr c ry ._g.aref A ly examined en consultstion with them , As long as the area of the Iranian waters can be described satisfactorily and exactly, I prefer the Iranian node of doing it, making the description part and parcel of the f rontier delimit a tion. ( 6 ) Art. 3 says i; Aussit6t apres 1 a sign atu re ; ' . I think our ; * rat if i.ea ti o n 1: more logical. There is no harm in appointing a Commission before the Treaty is ratified, and it might be in accord with the spirit of terminating the dispute in the shortest possible time, to do so. But the Commission would not operate until the Treaty came into force'.3./ (?) I do not see why the Iranian draft inserts in Art. 4 the words ;: les cours du :I before Bhatt-al~Arab. A Arc ich expert should advise. It omits words equivalent to u as far as the open sea 55 . There ought to be a te rmin us ad .queu, but the omission is in keeping with the silence of the draft on the approaches to the Shatt. I think such words ought to go in. ( 8 ) On the whole Art. 4 (A) is better than ours. It does not, however, refer to time of war, which I suggested it smould in my opinion of yesterday. The words n’une fa 9011 egale :; are quite proper. The terms of Art. 7 of the Barcelona Statute of 1981 on the Regime of Navigable Vaterways of International Concern may be usefully studied and, I think, followed. , ‘Rodovanccs' ,! is probably better than i; droios ct taxes 11 . To “entretien du Chatt on etat navi gable {} should be added 'ou d* amelioration de la voie navigable et de scs acels, ou a subvenir a dcs ddpenses fsites dans I’interet de la navigation.. ,! This is very important. (S) Art. 4 (3) takes no account of our wish that the whole of the Shatt including Iranian w-: tors should bo open to warships of our allies. See my Opinion of yesterday, Annex I. This is a most serious omission. (l) In Art. 5 the words H etant dgalemont interessbes etc . 11 should perhaps be altered to rnktant dgalenient dc'sireuees do la navigation lib re 1 '' etc. This Article clearly aims at the approaches to the Shatt, and we do not want words which might suggest equality of 'legal interest ' 1 , in a technical legal sense. 2. It follows from the ab ;ve that the chief points in the British Ambassador’s let 1 or arc jure satisiactorily uealt with 3 n the Iranian drax t, and wno uraft v/ilj. no g exo i-&lt;• i present form.3. As to the approaches to the Shatt, either the proposed letters should be exchanged, or ray proposal to incorporate a provision in the Treaty itself must be adopted, if this Treaty is finally to settle the matter. On the other hand, if no mention is made of the approaches, the status cnio will continue, except that ue agree to enter into a Conve ntion obviously including the approaches. See also para. 1 ( 8 ) s upra . 4. Something must 'be put in the Treaty or notes to be exchanged to preserve the status quo as to dredging etc. in 1 r an i a n v/a t o r s . 5.

Your despatch No. 98 (of March 5th; Perso-Iraqi frontier negotiations] and letter of March 5th to Mr. Baggallay. Mis Majesty s Government consider that all reasonahle concessions co/ pa 'lie with vital interests of Iraq should he made.to Persian point of view, hut agree that Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs is allowing his anxiety for settlement to obscure his judgment upon vital issues. As settlement seems possible in which important Iraqi as well as British interests may be sacrificed, you should draw serious attention of Iraqi Government to following views, stressing fact that advice is primarily given in interests of Iraq, although admittedly His Majesty’s Government, as her allies and representatives of bulk of shix/ping using Shaft-el-Arab, have important secondary interesto 2. Temporary dredging rights in new anchorage. Dangers of ceding anchorage extending to thalweg without providing for dredging etc. in absence of any agreement for unified conservancy are explained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of my telegram Ho._ J)£u Having regard to difficulties inherent in any conservancy negotiations and strength of Persian feeling it would be most unsafe to rely alone on oral statements of Persian Minister reported in paragraph 5 of your despatch, or on indefinite continuance of any conservancy convention that may later be concluded. Cession of anchorage will be perpetual and Iraqi Government, who are making appreciable sacrifice ...on o. . 2 . sacrifice in ceding it 5 are guarantees that navigability entitled to insist on reasonable of river will be maintained at present standards. 5. It is not essential however that these guarantees should be embodied in treaty itself. For instance they could be embodied in exchange of notes (forming part of treaty settlement) to general effect that both parties agree that except daring validity of any later agreement to contrary Iraq shall have right and duty to dredge in anchorage. Alternative ly; as pointed out in paragraph 7 (b) of my telegram No* 55, they could be embodied in eventual conservancy convention instead of in treaty settlement. T' this proves easier course, Persian Government should be warned now of intention of Iraqi Government who otherwise may lay themselves open to charge of having undertaken to establish conservancy convention with a mental reservation on an important matter of principle* 4. If second course is adopted provision will still be necessary for period between conclusion of frontier treaty and conclusion of conservancy agreement. This could take form of note from Persian Government asking Iraqi Government to dredge etc. in anchorage on their behalf until other arrangements are made and promising full facilities, together with an Iraqi acknowl edgment &lt;&gt; 5* Rooka Channel. There is admittedly element of logic in Persian Minister's contention that an agreement about Rooka channel is irrelevant to confirmation of 1913-1914 instruments, for any such agreement would in effect be an interpretative addition to those instruments. Iraqi Government should not, however, accept this argument as conclusive, since point derives its importance from fact that Persian officials havewarn on several occasions Persian waters. 5. ted that parts of channel lie in 3 * Line Irac i i Government should take is that they have nuv 0 r had any o.cuht hue that under nomal principles of international law applicable to such cases Hooka channel fails entirely outside Persian waters and that they would not have raised point as all unless Persian Government had first raised issue m manner described above. Tnis being so, and of treaty being to lay all boundary disputes between she two countries ••o rest for ever, they feel entitled to require Persian Governr.cno zc recognise lega.L position as explained n^- 1 - -'f price for cession of anchorage. r/, ° tit same time power of Persian Government to prefer above as pan vexatious claims in this area will he as great if negotiations break down as if a treaty which does not mention Hooka channel is concluded. Provided, therefore, that position of Iraqi Government has been made unmistakably clear and provided also that nothing elsewhere in settlement is susceptible of casting doubt on Iraqi’s claim to seaward approaches, it is unnecessary to insist to point of causing breakdown* 8. A decision in this sense would not prevent something being inserted in treaty showing that Shatt-el-Arah as an entity continues till high seas are reached, e.g. at end of first sentence of Article 4 of Persian draft ’kjusqu'h la haute rner ,! could be added (see Mr, McDougall's Point (7)). 9c As regards Minister for Foreign Affairs’ specific enquiry, conclusion of frontier treaty without any mention of Hooka channel will not alter status qu o at mouth of Shatt-el- Arab or give Persia any new legal basis for making claims in respect of seaward approaches. Legal position will be un altered, which means that an international tribunal would probably ...probably find that under 1915-1914 instruments Rooka channel lay outside Persian waters. Fact that provision may be made in frontier treaty for subsequent conclusion of navigation convention need not affect question one way or the ether, since navigation convention will (or should) say nothing about line of frontier or questions of sovereignty, but only about questions of administrative control, and since no convention is in any case likely to be of permanent duration. 10. Rights of passage for Iraq’s allies. Persian Minister's argument that this question is irrelevant to confirmation of 1915-1914 instruments is completely specious, since necessity for agreement arises here from fact that these instruments are not confirmed in their entirety. In spite of latest information as to width of navigable channel opposite Abadan it remains highly desirable to secure rights of passage through new anchorage for Iraqi warships. But whether such rights are recorded in treaty or not it is essential that there should be no distinction between Iraq and her allies. The matter should in fact be aealt with either on the lines of my telegram No. 56 o r of rny telegram No. 37 [of February 15th]. This is point on which Iraqi Government should, hold absolutely firm. At same time rights must clearly be reciprocal, and it would, no doubt pay Iraqi Government to explain at once that there would be correspond ing rights of passage through Iraqi waters for warships of Persia’s allies. Tern 'allies' would doubtless have to be extended in practice to cover any State which sent warships to Shatt-el-Arab at invitation of Iraq or Persia as case might be. 11. Some addition on lines of final sub-paragraph of my telegrams Nos. 56 and 57 is also necessary to avoid implication ...5. implication that other warships are liable to clues (see paragraph 4 (d) of my telegram No. 55). This has more than academic importance as both parties have financial interest in such dues ? and Iraqi Government might be in awkward position if they were held to be under perpetual contractual obligation to Persia to impose them on all visiting warships. lb. Agreement to conclude conservancy etc. convention, -bile wording of Article 5 is certainly on border-line it could hardly be held to oblige Iraq to sign a bilateral convention if she preferred to admit a third participant. Subject to your views it might be better not to raise this contentious issue unless undesirable alterations are introduced into proposed text. 15. On remaining points His Majesty's Government have little to add to observations of Mr. McDougall ? which seem sound. As regards his point (5) Admiralty state latitude and longitude of No. 1 Jetty should be as in original Iraqi draft and that most northerly point of Ghoteit island should be 50° 17' 25' North by 48° 19' 28' East. Point (6): 'entree en vigueur' might be better still. Point (7): I can see no reason for insertion of words 'les cours du' except that they occur in ISIS Protocol (see reference in my telegram No. 55 [of February 15th] paragraph 10). Point (8): It is doubtful whether a specific reference to time of war is essential if only merchant ships are concerned, although it is necessary in case of warships. 14.

It would be oXoi oiiely difficult for His Majesty’s Goverment to advise the Iraqi Government to reject the preferred oetulement since in the event of a subsequent breakdown in the negotiations His majesty's Government might oe hela x'es onsiole oy ooth slues.

He had 'been unable to stuuy the aetails of the new proposals as closely as he would have wished, as he had only just returned fron Geneva, and he would therefore ask hi . Baggallay to coinaent on them in gi-eater detail® MIh EAGGALLAY recalled that paragraph G 8 of the Foreign Office memoiandum contained a siumuary of the policy which the Foreign Office thought it would be advisable for Hus hajesty’s Government to recoi^iena to the Iragi Goveiniaent. He suggested that the Sub - Gormiittee should compare the solution which was now being considered oy the Persian ana Iraqi Gove indents with the solution suggesteu by the Foreign Office, with a view to asceitaining how far the various proposals corresponded. As regards conclusion ( 1 ) of the memorandum (1,6. that Iraq should ceae to Persia an anchox-age off Abadan extending to tne th alweg ) the .iie.aorandum hau anticipated the solution which the Iraqi Government now seemed disposed to accept. It was, however, no longer a question of whether His Majesty’s Government should take the initiative in suggesting a certain course of action to the Iraqi Government, out of wnether His majesty ’ s b-overrn.ent snould taue o.ctiv^ stepo to aeter them from taking a course of action which, if left to themselves (ana if Colonel Wara dia not over-persuade them), they seemed likely to take.-4- f't! As regaras the luaits of the proposed anchorage up ana aown strsau, these were, he thought ? those which the Admiralty haa -pi'eviously indicated as acceptable. Mp. sSxtL agreed that this was so, hut auaed that rf a thalweg frontier was in mind* with rights of passage for warships through the Persian anchorage the limits of the anchorage up and down stream ceased to he o f mu c h p r a c t i c al imp o r t anc e © ixa. aAGGALLAY then uiew attention to the fact that conclusion (2) ox' the lueiAoiandum had suggested that the Iraqi Government should be advised to ^ a i ce the cession of the thalwe£ anchorage dependent on certain conditions. The first of these (2(a)) was that Persia should accept the 1913-1914 frontier at all other points and that the agreement embodying this acceptance should be so drawn up as to exclude any possiule doubt regarding the I 1 “hi ti.le to the whole of the hooka channel. According to the information so far available tue Poi oian Government were willing to accent the first point, while the Iraqi Government proposed to suggest that there should oe an exchange of no-^o by ^ v^n^iTiise the v/hoie o f trie which Persia snouiu 1000 ^x 1 - , QO ' r r*u 1 territorial raters. It was Rooha chanuel as xia^ the ooiniou of the legal Risers of the Foreign Office that if the 1913-19x4 agreement were properly interpreted no part of the Hooka channel could be considered to Ire in Persian national or5- territorial waters, although some of it might lie in the open sea.» But it seemed desirable never theless to try and obtain a definite acceptance from Persia. In any case conclusion 2(a) was covered for the time 'being. The second suggested condition (2(h;) had been that an arrangement should be made whereby the right of passage through the waters of the Shatt-el Arab should be granted in perpetuity both in peace and war to the vessels of war and merchant vessels of all nations at peace with Persia or Iraq, as the case might he, or in the last resort to war ana merchant vessels belonging to Persia ana Iraq, ana their allies alone. The Persian Government haa suggested ilie gi ant ox a x ight of fiee passage to Persian ana Iraqi vessels only, out it appeared that the Iraqi Government intended to propose the inclusion of vessels belonging to their allies. This was possibly a solution which His Majesty’s Government coulu. adopt in the last resort, tnough it was clearly far less desirable than a universal dedication on the lines suggested in the Foreign Oilice memorandum. A recent letter from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad suggested that he had derived the impression from the memorandum that the warships of Iraq and Persia could oe granted reciprocal rights of passage by a bilateral treaty between those two Powers, ana that it was only for the sake of the warsnips of other countries, including the allies of either Power, that a universal dedication was required. Tins of + q rqc-p. it was extremely doubtful course was not tne ca^o. ^ u-6— whetxier 'tlis Irs.(^i s.nci P 6 rsis.n Governinent-s could uroucily sign u '-'i eaty oy v/fiicli Gucii conii*Q,ctj 6 cL 1 o clo soiii©'tiling, in certain given cn cruristances which could reasonably he hslu by a third Power to be a breach of the rules of neu i■■ a 1 ify and as such a breach would occur just as effectively if Persia allowed an Iragi warship to pass through her waters when Persia was a neutral and Iran was a belligerent (or vice vers a), as it would if she allowed a v/arship oelonging to an ally of Iraq, or any other belligerent Power to do so ? the question of a universal dedication was just as important for Iraq as for Persia or His Llajesty’s Government. Should it prove impossible, however, to induce the two Governments to accept this arrangement, it would probably be advisable, rather than risk up setting a settlement, to accept the more limited arrangement, although this was undoubtedly less satisfactory. The third suggested condition (2(c)) was an arrangement whereby each Government would undertake to carry out such work ±ii the waters under its control as should be necessary for the maintenance of an efficient waterway and further that in the event of any failure on the part of either Government to fulfil this condition, the other Government should have the right to carry out at its own expense in the waters of the Government concerned such ;vork as might be necessary to make good the deficiency. rhis condition was clearly of great importance, out so far neither the Persian proposals nor the intended. Iraqi counter-proposals contained anything to this effect._7_ The fourth suggested condition (2 (d)) was that Iraq should maintain in force the present arrangements with regard to conservancy and shinping control in the new Ahadan anchorage until such time as the Persian Government were in a position to undertake those services themselves* and should in any case continue to do so until the establishment cf an international Board whether advisory or otherwise? for the control of conservancy and navigation* It appeared that the Iraqi Government intended, as one of the conditions of the frontier settle ment? to press for the inclusion in the frontier treaty of a provision which, although drafted in somewhat different terms, would in fact have almost exactly the same effect in that under it the existing navigation, conservancy and sanitary services of the Port of Basra would continue to operate until such time as the proposed conservancy and navigation convention should have been concluded. In Conclusion (3) of the memorandum it was suggested that the proposal for a. tripartite conservancy board convention should be dropped for the present and that instead the Iraqi Government should endeavour to come to an agreement with the Persian Government, if possible simultaneously with the grant of the Abadan anchorage, for the establishment of a system of conservancy and navigation control based on two local national boards w r ith a central international advisory board, which was, however, to be able to make recommendations which should be binding on both parties in disputes arising out cf the interpretation o° any agreement affecting the river.-3 The idea that the s 7 sten of national hoards should he set up simultaneously with the cession to Persia of the Abadan anchorage ? did not? however, form part of the Persian uroposals, and moreover fir A, Clark Kerr considered that it would he difficult for the Iraqi Government to conclude such an agreement with the Persian Government simultaneously with the frontier agreement 0 At the same time the Persian proposals definitely provided for the suhsequent conclusion of an agreement regarding conservancy and navigation, and certain subsidiary questions such as smuggling, and provided there were adequate safeguards to cover the position of Iraq in the event of the negotiations for this agreement coming to nothing, this seemed a satisfactory procedure. MroBaggallay went on to observe that from this analysis it appeared that a large part the Poreign Office proposals had. already been met. There were, of course, some specific points on which further advice would have to he given to the Iraqi Government. Two points stood out. In the first place an effort should certainly he made to secure a universal dedication of the waters of the Sha11-e1-Arab to the warships and merchant vessels of all nations. Secondly, as regards the question of conservancy and navigation it appeared unlikely that a convention providing' tor co—ordination in tne control of the river services could have perpetual validity either nominally or in practice, and for this reason itappeared advisable to make a strong recommendation to the Iraqi Governnent to -press for an arrangement on the lines inoica.ted in Conclusion 2 (c), rn here was perhaps one further point which should 'be mentioned# It concerned the tactics to 'be adopted hy Iraq in the forthcoming negotiations. According to the most recent telegram from Bagdad (No, 6 Saving of 25th January (paper No* h*o T h (0) 221)) it appeared that the Iraqi Government were thinking of stipulating that the treaty embodying the frontier settlement should not he ratified until the subsequent conservancy conventions had been concluded. It was, however, exceedingly doubtful whether this was a wise policy. The chief merit of the Persian proposals was that they offered the prospect of a final settlement of a problem that had existed for a hundred- years, The conclusion of satisfactory conservancy and navigation arrangements might, however, be as difficult after the settlement of the frontier as before# It therefore seemed desirable to clinch the x frontier settlement while the opportunity offered, and that could only be done by early ratification by the Nejliss, and presumably by the Iraqi Parliament, followed by a formal exchange of ratifications and registration with the League of Nations. It was of course important to have safeguards to protect Iraq’s position if no subsequent agreement were reached, but the other safeguards already suggested should be adequate to guarantee to Iraq the maintenance of an -9-M -10- efficient waterway and the right to take whatever steps were necessary to secure such maintenance should the Persian Go Vermont fail in its duties. Mio BPIGHT01T suupested that a difficulty might arise over the implementation of condition 2 (c) unless it were made clear that some impartial agency should have the power to decide whether or not action under this provision was justified. IcH* fGAL said that the Admiralty were mainly pre-occupiod with the right of British warships to pass up and down the river, and for that reason they had always wished to avoid the cession to Persia of an extent of water which would reader it impossible for vessels to r^ach Basra without leaving Iraqi waters. Assuming, however, for the moment that a thalweg anchorage was inevitable they were mainly concerned with securing from Persia an adequate guarantee for the massage of British vessels through Persian waters. The Timiralty were in fact willing to agree to the cession of the Abadan anchorage, but their consent was dependent on the acceptance of some of the later points which l-v. Bag gal lay had raised. The Admiralty had always regarded the whole problem of the Shatt-el-Arab as falling into two divisions, i. e. (l) the question of the legal right of British ships to pass up the river to Basra and (&lt;i) trie question of their physical ability to do so, and it might be convenient to consider the problem under these two aspects.-11- As regards (l) the Admiralty had so far been reluctant to agree to the cession of the thalv^eg anchorage because of the difficulty of passing up to Basra entirely within the Persian half of the river,, It appeared that if the present Persian proposals 9 as modified by the Iraqi counter-proposals 9 were to be put into effect 9 such right of passage as we should 'possess through Persian waters would be a treaty right 9 and as such liable to be curtailed or even denounced at some future date. But 9 more than this 9 the Admiralty felt that the new arrangement was dangerous from the point of view of the law of neutrality, 1 They wished to point out that in the event of His Majesty’s Govern ment and Iraq becoming engaged in a war as allies ana Persia remaining neutral 9 Persia would be under an international obligation springing from the law of neutrality to prevent the passage through her nauional waters (there was no doabt that the Shatt-el-Arab was national and not territorial- waters) oi British and Iraqi vessels. The relevant passage in Oppenneim would be found in the Fifth JJdition 9 Volume II 9 psg^ 0 O 00 In view of this danger the Admiralty had always considered that only a treaty of a sufficiently general character could modify the effect of international law with regard to the question of neutrality. This was the attitude which the Admiralty had maintained in the past, hut at the recent meeting at the Foreign Office a new proposal had been put forward byf\ V -12 Mr. Beckett which, had j.nduced them to change their view to a large extent. This was the proposal for a general dedication of the river in perpetuity to the warships and merchant vessels of all nations. This proposal at once put a different complexion on the whole question of the right of passage 3 since in the event of it being accepted the danger of Persia being bound by the international laws of neutrality would no longer arise. The Admiralty were therefore willing to agree to the cession of the anchorage on condition that such a universal dedication formed part of the agreement. But they would be extremely reluctant to consent if such a dedication were not made 9 since it was possible that a situation might then arise at some future time when a treaty provision regarding the right of passage would nrove to be illusory. It would admittedly be difficult at this stage to veto the acceptance by the Iraqi Government of the Persian proposals 9 but the Admiralty considered that his i.-iajesty’ s Government should use all their influence to induce Iraq to press for a universal dedication, pointing out at tne same time that this would, in fact, be as much in the interest of Iraq as in that of Persia. THT CIIAlPI/IAr said that he entirely agreed wit a Hr. Seal that a universal dedication would be infinitely preferable, if it could be obtained. Sir A. Clark Kerr considered, however, (although he admittedly hud misunderstood the proposal when he wrote) that it wasj:::' ——o- doubtful whether the Iraqi Governnent would be willing to agree, and Persia was likely to be even more reluctarrc than Iraq. On the other hand it was clear that His majesty’s Government could not well prevent Iraq from accepting the Persian proposals and in the circumstances it seemed that the most His majesty’s Government could do was to ensure that the Iraqi Government at least realised all the implications of the proposals, in the hone that they might thus be persuaded to accept it. After sowe discussion it was generally agreed that it would be inpracticable for His majesty’s Government to try to prevent Iraq from accepting the Persian proposal for a thalweg' frontier, but that steps should be taken to ensure that they realised the true implications of the doctrine of universal dedication and that every effort should be made to secure its acceptance by both Governments. UR. c-HaL then dealt with point ( 2 ) which concerned the Question of the future conservancy of the river, recommendations as to which were set forth under Conclusions 2(c) and 5 of the foreign 0?fice memorandum. In his opinion, the arrangement envisaged under Conclusion 2(c) needed some clarification. for instance trouble would arise in the event of it becoming necessary for the Iraqi Government as a result of any failure on the part of the Persian Government to maintain the navigability of the river, to take active steps to carry out the necessary work at their own expense in-14- 'ST- 1 Persian waters* as regards the question of dredging itself? the procedure would probably be comparatively simple? since it was easy to determine whether a specified depth of water was or was not being maintained, but this would not be the cose as regards other essential river services? as, for instance? the work of bunding. It was conceivable that when the Iraqi Government contended that the work had not been done adequately by the Persian authorities? the latter would deny that this had been the case, and it therefore seemed desirable that in the event of a difference of opinion arising there should be a third, party to whom an appeal could be made? and who should have the necessary authority to give a definitive ruling. At the same time, he realised that if the proposed central advisory board had such authority it would in e.ti ect have executive power 9 that is to say it would bo a definite daporturn from the idea of a purely advisory E oar d c for these reasons he could not help feeling that the proposal for a tripartite conservancy Board, even if it were necessary in order to secure Persian acceptance to exclude from its control the Karun and the Bahr.ianshir, would he preferable to that of a system of national Boards with a central advisory Board, and he suggested that further effort should he made to persuade the two Governments to accept the former uroposal. (Lieut. -Colonel Webb arrived at this point).-15- THb CHAIRMAN doubted whether the establishment a tripartite executive Board would in fact prove adequate for obtaining the desired guarantees as regards the physical conservancy of the river, since in all the circumstances the Shah was almost ceruair. to refuse to allow foreigners to interfere in any way in Persian territory, which included not only the Karun and Babmanshir, but the whole left bank of the river. .Ample evidence as to his attitude in this respect would be found in the difficulties which had been experienced even by Colonel ward, A tripartite Board which did not control the Karun and the Bahmanshir was also unsatisfactory from the point o.^ view of the Iraqi Government, since it seemed illogical that ;°ersia should be represented on a Board which controlled waters belonging almost entirely to Iraq, But he quite agreed that a tripartite Board with full British participation was to be preferred if it could be obtained. He found, however, that this might not prove possible? in which case the National Board’s proposal would have much to recommend it» There was as a matter of fact no reason to suppose that the Persian and Iraqi authorities would find it more difficult to co-operate under a system .of National Boards than in a single tripartite Board, but rather the reverse. As regards detailed arrange ments, such as the levying of dues, it would no doubt be possible to devise a system which would be just as satisfactory as that contemplated under the draft Conservancy Board Convention. These difficultiesloomed large, Toecauae they had not been deeply studied, uliereas everything connected with the tripartite Convention had been worked out in great detail. hr. Beckett had given it as his opinion that the question of dues would not present any insuperable difficulties, and given sufficient study a satisfactory arrangement for the apportionment of revenue and expenditure could no doubt be elaborated. In any case, however? he did not think this question really arose at the present time. The proposal which apparently held the field was that the two parties should merely agree to conclude an agreement about these matters subsequently and when the negotiations for that agreement started, his majesty Government could offer the Iraqi Government whatever advice they thought fit as to the form of control to be set up. Meanwhile it was important to distinguish between the immediate political question of the proposed frontier settlement with the proposed guarantees for the Abadan anchorage, and the eventual conservancy question, which would have to be settled subsequently. MB. BAGGALLAf said he would like to add a word of explanation about conclusion 2(c). The proposal had not been worked out in any detail. While any river convention was in force the Central Board might be.the arbiter or the right could perhaps simply be regarded as in abeyance. But the underlying idea was not that it should be a right to be exercised every time some minor dispute or difficulty arose, but a right of a fundamental character which should for all time guarantee Iraq and Persia against a total deterioration in the situation in the river.River conventions might come and river conventions might go 5 but such a right would in theory at least stand for ever 5 , and its value would be greater in the distant future than in the present. It might well be that disputes might arise as to whether the right had been properly exercised. But this was a subsidiary point. The real point was that it would always give Iraq an excuse at least for taking action after words had failed. In fact it afforded a sci ntilla of justification for unilateral action when things went r adic ally wrong. LiR. its value SRAL asked whether . r. no higher than that o Baggallay put HR. BAGGALLAY said he had put its value as low as possible in view of the dilficuloies which no.d been shown to attach to it. He quite agreed that if it were embodied in an agreement and accepted by Aeioia (which was perhaps a doubtful factor) there was no reason why it should not be regarded as having full i. e g a 1 v al idi ty e MR. SISAL explained that the question with which the Admiralty were most concerned from the noxnt of view of conservancy was the question of dredging. It was essential that hath parties should undertake to mainiam a certain depth of water in those parts of the river which were under their control, and this was in fact the only aspect of the conservancy problem which could oeI defined at all clearly* Conclusions 2 (c) and 3 were therefore intimately connected. As regards conclusion 2 (d.) lie felt that the Iraqi Government would he extremely unwise to ahrogate the temporary arrangement contemplated therein unless soecial provision were made in the eventual conservancy convention for the maintenance of the navigable channel at some specified depth. Better still? the actual depth which was to he maintained hy 'both parties might he specified in the frontier agree ment itself. If it were only specified later as part of the conservancy convention the orovision would he revocable? whereas if it formed part of the frontier treaty it would he irrevocable. If this were done the position would he as satisfactory as it was at present, from the point of view of river conservancy olio, tne Admiralty would have no objection in this respect. TfT' CHAIRMAN thought that there should he no difficulty in incorporating a provision to this efxect within the frontier agreement itself. It was? however? suggested that it might he difficult to lay down in the main treaty a depth of water which would he suitable for all time? end that the wording of Conclusion 3(c)? which had been honoured from the draft conservancy convention (and which had been very carefully chosen hy the Board of Trade) might he retained. LiRc GCAL further enquired whether it would not ■be possible to provide that the interim arrangement envisaged under point (d) should automatically enter int o force again in the event of the ConservancyI - ■ 19- / \ H' / I I Board Convention lapsing. \mt the Chairman thought that the Persian Government would never accept such a provision* CAPTAIN CRBASY thought that it would he very difficult for more than one authority to dredge a channels whether that channel was a frontier 0 r not 0 MR. HALE observed that the question of dues was of some importances as these were at present no security for the repayment to His Laoesty’s Government of the debt owing from the Port of Basra. . In conclusion THE HTAIRkAN said that more detailed proposals for the eventual conservancy arrangements could be worked out later?but meanwhile no time should be lost in instructing Sir A. Clark Kerr to communicate to the Iraqi Government the substance of the recommendations of His majesty's Government as to the frontier settlement? with regard to which agreement seemed to exist between the different Departments. CONCL USIO NS. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed (a) That a draft telegram to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad should be prepared by the Foreign Office for the concurrence of the Admiralty? on the following lines:- His Majesty's Government consider it desirable that the Iraqi Government shall settle the frontier on the basis of the proposals made by the Persian Government, subject to the acceptance by the Persian Government of conditions which shall guarantee20 (i) full legal rights of passage for Iraqi and British warships (including troopships and military and Air Force supply ships) through any waters ceded to Persia at Abadan (Conclusion 2(b) of the Foreign Office Memorandum.) (ii) continued physical ability on the part of Iraqi and British Y/arships (including troopships and military and Air Force supply ships) to pass through such waters (Conclusions 2(c) and (d) of the Foreign Office Memorandum)o His Majesty 7 s Government also wish the advantages of Conclusion 2(b) 9 i c eo 9 a universal dedication of the river to the warships of all nations to be strongly impressed on the Iraqi Government® (b) That at the proper time an attempt should be made to secure the establishment of a tripartite executive conservancy board? even if the Karun and the Bahmanshir have to be excluded from its jurisdiction? but that if this object cannot be attained? a system of national Boards with a central advisory Board on the lines of the Foreign Office Memorandum, might be accepted* (c) That the Iraqi Government should be advised to bring the frontier agreement into full force as soon as possible? assuming adequate guarantees regarding the Abadan anchorage are secured? without waiting for the conclusion of the subsequent river conventionso 2?

His Majesty’s G-overnment agree that Persian proposals were unexpectedly satisfactory, and consider that in all the circumstances Iraqi Government have acted prudently in accepein them as a general basis of discussiom 2c Points to which Iraqi Government should attach extreme importance are, as you know:- • (a) continuance of legal right of warships of Iraq and her Allies to pass between Basra and high seas in all circumstances, and (b) maintenance of navigable channel through which such legal right of passage must be exercised in a conditi suitable for passage of large ships. 3. I gather that as regards both (a) and (b), basis of draft Treaty contained in your telegram No. 11 Saving is that after anchorage has been ceded a sufficient navigable channel will still remain within Iraqi waters. His Majesty's Govern ment are prepared to agree that this is so, subject to observations in paragraph 6 and 7 below and provided that anchorage does not extend north of No. I Jetty. Admirllty nevertheless wish to point out that if in addition rights ol passage for Iraq and her allies through the Persian half of the river can be obtained in the Treaty, such rights might make it possible in war to use the whole width of the r„ver, and thus avoid inevitable congestion and inconvenience in the relatively narrow channel which will remain in Iraqi waters.2 , It would be necessary to institute one way traffic through this channel unless such rights of passage exist. These advantages would have great value from Iraqi point of view. 4. for this reason alone, it is desirable to amend drafting of article 4(b) ? which in addition has following defects (a) If it is intended to bestow rights of passage as well as exemption from dues, this should be made clear by dealing with the two points in separate sentences. ('b) If it is not intended in general to provide specially for rights of passage for iraqi warships tnrough ceded anchorage, mention of Iraqi warsnips in this ar ci^j is superfluous. (o) 11% on the other hand the intention is to provide such rights of passage they are also i equi.ro cl U-n Tran’s own interest) for warships of iraq s allies. (d) Article is dangerous as being open to construction that bhatt is not open to any warships ai all except viobe of Iraq and Persia, or at any rate that other war snips muot pay dues (which would be contrary to generally acce^too. international go urte sy). 5. In the circumstances it would be lar preieiaul^ for Article 4 (b) to be re-drafted on lines of text contained in my tele gram ^No. 56 (Alternative A) or i ailing chau oi t^-x^ contained in my telegram No. 37 (Alternaoiv., B)» 6o His Majesty’s Government also desire to point out importance of ensuring that dredging rights in Article 4 (c) revive if any conservancy agreement eventually concluded cea^s to be operative. It must be remembered that although thalweg may at present day follow a line which leaves a wide navigable channel on Iraqi side, thalweg (and with it the frontier) would .shift its position if for any reason navigable channel on Persian side began to silt up and Persian Government were unwilling, and Iraqi Government unable, to take remedial Therefore it is important to ensure as far as possible measures.possible that the Iraqi Government will he able to dredge on the Persian side at any time ? whether now or in the remote future, if there is not in force some alternative agreement ensuring adequate dredging on the Persian side. 7. In face of this possibility one of two things is necessary:- (a) Either care should be taken to ensure that in Persian and Arabic text words n In absence of any agreement to the contrary’ 5 can only bear construction that rights granted by that article will only remain in abeyance while any n agreement to the contrary” is in force and will not be finally extinguished by conclusion of such an agreement, or (b) If (a) proves impossible, the eventual n agreement to the contrary” should itself contain a provision to this effect. 3. Apart from description of anchorage, which I agree is clumsy, but seems good enough, Article 4 (c) and Letter No, 1 would also be improved by re-drafting. 9. Article 4 (c) should read:- !? In that part of the river where the thalweg forms the boundary, it shall be tne duty and rigllfof Iraqi ^ Government, in absence of any agreement to contrary, to undertake on both sides of the thalweg dredging and all other works, etcA { 10.

This re-drafting makes the position more water-tight', uut piesent draft may be good enough for practical purposes. II. You should bring the considerations in this telegram to notice of Iraqi Government and suggest that in the cour further discussions (in which Persian Government -ill c se of cubtless propose numerous amendments) they should themselves endeavour to secure amendment of Article 4 (b) and 4 (c) and Letter ho. 1 on lines indicated.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that it was approved by the Council of Ministers and that he handed it to the Persian Minister on January 26th. 2. As regards the second paragraph of the same telegram, Dr. Naji told me yesterday that Mudhaffar Alam had suggested that the Iraqi Government should produce the first draft and that the work had been entrusted to Mr. Edmonds. 3. Mr. Edmonds has since then given me confidentially a copy of his draft and of the explanatory letter which he sent with it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Copies of these two documents are enclosed herein. 4. I do not yet know what opinion Dr. Naqi has of this draft, but I expect that he will soon consult me about it.

Monsieur le Kinistre, I acknowledge with many thanks Your Excellency’s letter No. 638 of 20th January, 1937. As I informed Your Excellency in my previous letter the present Iraqi Government, from the moment of its assumption ox oixice, placed in the forefront of its programme the early settlement of all outstanding differences with its neighbour, Iran, anci the consolidation of relations of genuine friendship, mutual trust, and co-operation between the two States. It is therefore with the greatest gratification that it recognizes in your letter under reference the plainest proofs that the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah reciprocates these sentiments. The Iraqi Government accepts this exchange of letters, namely my letter C/5/17 dated 25th November, 1936 and your letter 638 of 20th January, 1937 as furnishing a basis for the final settlement of the frontier question, and have authorised me to initiate at once negotiations for the drafting and conclusion of a treaty to this end. In conclusion I desire to express to Your Excellency personally my cordial appreciation of your wise and friendly efforts which have contributed so largely towards the removal of the last doubts and uncertainties and towards bringing about complete harmony in the views of our two Governments. I avail etc.Enclosure In Bagdad despatch Mo. 49 of 89.1.36. COPY 28th January, 1937. In order to facilitate early consideration of the text of the Treaty to settle the Boundary controversy with Iran, I send you herewith without delay my first rough draft of the Treaty as I conceive it. It will of course require careful consideration and polishing in consultation with the legal and other experts. Most of the points are so familiar that I need only discuss two points here. After drafting letter No. 1 I began to v/onder whether, since it is to be an integral part of the Treaty, it would not be better to insert the definition of the boundary between the territorial waters in the Treaty itself between Articles 2 and 3 of the draft. But on further thought I incline to keep it as a letter. If Inserted in the Treaty it might look as if we were asking for something new, whereas our contention is that 'Shatt- al-Arab as far as the sea*' includes the approaches; all we want is acknowledgment. In draftin Article 4.d. I have assumed what I have always understood from Colonel Ward, that at the Muhammara anchorage the thalweg must always remain on the Iraqi side of the median line. H. E. Dr. Naji al Assil.RQU &amp;H. DRAFT OF THE IRANI-IRAQ.I SE TTLING THE BOUNDARY DUERTT ON.

ARTICLE 2. Subject to the provisions of article 4 of this Treaty the C-overnment of Iraq hereby cedes to Iran, for the port of Abbadan, an anchorage bounded as follows: (Exact description to be drafted in consultation with Colonel Ward).

Immediately after ratification of the present Treaty a Demarcation Commission shall be formed charged with the task of renewing the boundary pillars erected by the Commission referred to in Article 1 and erecting such additional pillars as may be considered necessary.

Proposals for a new polocy. A* Introduction, Recent developments in the Perso-Iraai frontier negotiations leave little hope, if any, ©f a solution 6 f the kind which His Majesty’s Government have hitherto hoped to achieve: that is to say, the confirmation of the frontier laid down in 1913-1914, except for the creation of a Persian anchorage of moderate width (say 100 yards) opposite Abadan, and the conclusion between Iraq, Persia and the United Kingdom of a Ccnvention setting up a Tripartite Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board with full executive powers and functions over the whole waterway system, on the lines set out in the draft Convention first communicated to the Iraqi and Persian Governments in 1932. The unwillingness ot the Persian Government to place the all—important waters of the l©wer Karun and Bahmanshir under any kind of international control is apparently insuperable, while they seem equally determined ( 1 kot to accept any invitation to participate in a river commission on which His iiajeety's Government are the only non-rinarian Government to be represented. At the same time it is clear that the respect which successive Iraqi governments have expressed for the draft Convention prepared by His Majesty's Government has never blossomed into affection. tn/ (^determined, that is, not to do so in return for no more than an anchorage off Abadan.... 2. These factors, and especially the Persian attitude, render impossible the establishment of a tripartite Conservancy Board on the lines hitherto contemplated, and are doubtless responsible for the policy adapted by the new Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has already made to tho Persian Government a suggestion which the previous Iraqi Government had intended to make next March, largely on Turkish advice, in the event of no agreement having been reached in the interval. This suggestion is to the effect that the two governments shall settle the frontier dispute on the following lines: the 1913-1914 line will be confirmed subject to the creation of a Persian anchorage off Abadan, and the two -governments will agree in principle to continue the discussion of such questions as the establishment of a commission to control conservancy and navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab. In addition Iraq will agree to sign the non-aggression pact between Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan and herself which has already been initialled, but not yet signed owing to the unwillingness of the Iraqi Government tt., bring it into force before the frontier question is settled. • There is, however, little likelihood that even this limited programme will be accomplished, for the Iraqi Government not only wish to retain in their uwn hands the conservancy of the anchorage which it is proposed to cede to Persia at Abadan, but also-to restrict the width #f that anchorage to- seventy-five yards, or at most to a quarter of the distance across the river, while the Persian Government are insistent that it shall extend to. mid—stream or to the th alweg (see footnote to paragraph 5 ( 3 ) below). 4. There is thus every prospect of the dispute dragging/dragging on interminably, a state of affairs which can do nothing but harm not only to Perso-Iraqi but also to Anglo- Persian relations, and may even lead to some Persian t jjQhP main which it may be easy to stigmatise as an outrage, but difficult to remedy in effect. Concurrently, there is the possibility that tke new Iraq_i Government may suddenly reach agreement with the Persian Government along some unexpected line which would take no account of the interests of His Majesty’s Government. it seems essential in these circumstances for His Majesty’s Government to review, and possibly revise, the policy which they have followed during the last two years, and the ourpose of the present memorandum is to examine certain alternative lines of policy which may be more likely to lead to a settlement. 5. For the purposes of discussion, the nossible solutions of the political question of the line of the frontier (as distinct from the question of the control of conservancy and navigation) may be summarised as follows (1) The acceptance by Persia of the 1913-1914 line unchanged. (P) The acceptance by Persia of the 1913-1914 line subject te the transfer of a ’’narrow” strip of water off Abadan. (3) The grant to Persia of a strip of water off Abadan ( 2 ) extending to the thaTweg , in return for her acceptance of the remainder of the 1913-1914 line. ( 4 ) ( 2 ) The Persian Government ask for a mid-stream frontier ”as at hommerah”, where the frontier is the median line. But the objections to a median line frontier are much stronger than those to a thalweg frontier and when it came to the ncint the Persian Government would probably not make difficulties over this distinction, of which they may not even realize the existence.(4) The alteration of the frontier from the 1913-1914 line to the thalweg from Mahommerah (Kh«rramshahr) to the open sea. (5) the establishment •f*'some form of condominium or joint Iraqi and Persian control over the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab from Mahommerah to the open sea. According to which of these solutions is eventually adopted, somewhat different arrangements as regards conservancy and navigation will be necessary or appropriate.. 6 . Of these solutions, ( 1 ) must unfortunately be dismissed as having ceased to be within the range of practical policy, since no concession which the Iraqi Government could make in •th£r spheres would be likely to induce the Persian Government to forego so completely their most cherished ambitions. ( 2 ) has now scarcely more chance of acceptance, in view of the imp^rtpnce which the Persian Government are known to attach on grounds of amour- prcpre to a more spectacular solution. continue to press for or aim at such a solution will It ad nvits/here, and merely cause increasing ill-feeling, of which His Majesty’s Government will probably come in for a large share. (4) and (5), on the other hand, would probably prove inacceptable to the Iraqi Government, although in the opinion of the a&gt; Foreign Office they might be found to* possess advantages which might well out-weigh their disadvantages, both for the Iraqi Government and for His Majesty’s Government. The best hope of a solution, therefore, for the present at any rate, seems to be on the lines of ( 3 ). B. Proposal for a Thalweg Frontier o pposite Abadan . (a) General . 7. The arguments in favour of giving Persia an anchorage/(^ t: y anchorage extending to- the thalweg opnosite Abadan, n«twithstanding the objections which have been urged against this course in the past, are mainly those of higher policy. It is essential for Iraq to cultivate genuinely friendly relations with Persia, but s* ling as the frontier dispute remains unsettled, the establishment of such relations is impossible. This is equally true of the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Persia, and it must be remembered that in the event of hostilities involving the Shatt—el—Arab it is likely to be at least as important for His Majesty’s Government to obtain oil from Persia as to send warships to Basra. The events of the past year have lent a degree of reality to the problems of the Shatt-el- Arab which they did not possess in earlier years, but above all else they have made it imperative that the whole question should be settled in a manner which will enable His Majesty’s Government and Iraq to rely on Persian friendship in the unsettled period which may lie ahead. This is a matter of pure self-interest for His Majesty’s Government, and the manner in which the Persian Government have hitherto conducted the dispute, or the general behaviour of Persia towards His Majesty’s Government, form no part of the argument. 8 . But while tolerably friendly relations between the Powers interested in the Shatt-el-Arab are impossible without a frontier settlement, no settlement can be lasting or effective unless it satisfies reasonable Persian aspirations. Unless it does so, Persia will be under a constant temptation to use the very real powers of obstruction and interference which her geographical position undoubtedly gives her, all legal barriers no tw i th s t a nd i ng, /notwithstanding, to the detriment of Iraq and of His Majesty's Government * In the event of war this might be not only inconvenient but dangerous. Whatever may be the legal and historical basis 4f the existing frontier, it is unquestionably abnormal, and only defensible on the ground that Persia has other outlets to the sea and Iraq has none. There can be no doubt that this abnormality has created a genuine grievance in the minds of the Shah and his counsellors, and this grievance is a serious obstacle to complete tranquillity in the Middle East. It has been made abundantly clear that the minimum concession which will. .- remove this grievance is an anchorage •ff Abadan, and it can hardly be denied that even for practical purposes an anchorage within the narrow limits hitherto suggested is of little value, while for purposes of amour-propre or of satisfying the Persian psychological grievance it is of no value at all. It is therefore submitted that the true interests of Iraq, and a fortiori of His Majesty’s Government, who have in addition to consider the position of the Angl^-Iranian Oil Company, demand that Iraq shall conciliate Persia by granting her a thalweg frontier at least opnosite Abadan. If this were done with a grod grace, and the remaining details if the settlement could be satisfactorily adjusted, the gain in Persian good-will and c#-operation should far outweigh the attendant risks. * 9. At the same time it is necessary to examine these risks. Briefly, they are that the grant to Persia of ./ legal sovereignty iver any part of the navigable channel of the Shatt-el-Arab might all#w circumstances to arise in which it was no longer both legally and physically possible for His Majesty’s Ships to pass between Basra and the open sea/0 * sea in all circumstances «f peace and war. If it meant, as it probably would mean dn practice, that vessels could no longer pass Abadan without impinging upon Persian - waters, in however slight a degree, the danger would admittedly exist;- (a) that any vessels which might wish to pass Abadan could only do so at the pleasure of Persia as the sovereign pov^er: this would apply particularly to the belligerent vessels engaged in a war in which Persia was neutral; (b) that any vessels which might wish to pass Abadan could only' do so if Persia were not •'only sufficiently well-disposed but also sufficiently active to maintain her 'waters as part of an efficient waterway. &lt;? There are, however, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, ways and means by which these dangers can be eliminated. (b) Legal Rights of Passage . 10. In the first place, as has been shown in a previous memorandum (see M.S.(O) 167 of 30th November, 1934), there- is^ no reason why Persia should not subscribe to an agreement which would under international law over ride her rights and duties as a neutral in time «f war, rr have the effect of preventing her obligations- as a neutral involving the duty to close to belligerent warships the stretch of river under Persian sovereignty. The most limited form which such an agreement^could take would be the grant to Iraq by Persia of a right of passage for Iraqi warships, or lor the warships of Iraq and Iraq’s allies, through all Persian waters in the ,Shatt-el-Arab in. all circumstances. Persia would be unlikely to. grant this/this right unless Iraq granted a reciprocal right in respect of Iraqi waters ? but there should be no difficulty about this, especially as the right probably exists already in virtue of the Treaty of Srzerum. But although such an agreement might afford an adequate excuse for any departure from strict neutrality which Persia, as a benevolent neutral, might be disposed to make in favour of Iraq and her allies, and although this might, having regard to the probable circumstances of any hostilities affecting the Shatt-el-Arab, be a sufficient safeguard for most practical purposes, it is uncertain whether it would in law constitute a complete answer to complaints by third Powers that the rules of neutrality were not being observed. 11. In order to furnish a legally perfect answer to such complaints, it would be necessary to create a state of affairs in which the rights of the potential complainant were inevitably the same as those of his opponents, and the only way to d# this would be to dedicate the river as a whole to the use of the vessels *f commerce and of war of all nations, at peace ’with Iraq (f r Persia in respect of the ( 3) Persian portions of the river). 7 Apart from being the only completely satisfactory method by which Iraq could secure an undisputed right #f passage for herself and her allies in the event of any alteration in the existing frontier, and by which Persia could obtain it even in existing circumstances, a universal dedication would have the advantage of relieving both riparian states of all technical legal/ 3 (3) The question could be considered separately whether it should be made clear that Iraq (or Persia as the case might be) retained the right to seize in her waters when at war neutral vessels carrying contraband to her enemy.legal responsibility f*r the us.e of the river by belligerent Powers. It would in fact bring the case within the principle laid dawn by the Permanent Court of International Justice with regard to the Kiel Canal (an artificial waterway and therefore a more extreme case) in the ’’Wimbledon” dispute in view of the provisions of Article 38« of the Treaty if Versailles (Publications of the Permanent Caurt of International Justice, Series A.Ha.l. p.28); ’’When an artificial waterway connecting two open seas ”has been dedicated in a permanent manner to the use of ’’the whole world, the waterway becomes assimilated to ”a natural strait to the extent that the passage of ’’even a belligerent man-of-war does not prejudice the ’’neutrality of the territorial State under whose ’’jurisdiction the waterway in question is.” At the same time the fact that the universal dedication would appiy 'kc* rights oi passage only and not to the use of any Persian or Iraqi ports upon the river would leave both Persia and Iraq as free in practice as at present to control the entry of warships which entered otherwise than by the invitation or consent of one or the other of the riparian States. # 12. It would be essential for the rights of passage granted by this universal dedication to be perpetual and irrevocable, especially as an alteration in the line of the frontier at Abadan or elsewhere would be perpetual and irrevocable/ (”) Provided the dedication is permanent and general, it does not seem to be in principle material whether the waterway which provides a means of communication to another State does so by first connecting with another sea or by itself touching the ports of that other State.irrevocable (any qualification of the transfer of sovereignty would almost certainly he impracticable, and in any case certain to prove ineffective when the time, came)» In this connexion it should be observed that it would be far more difficult for Persia to attempt to ignore a universal dedication than to retract a right granted to Iraq alone. 13. The foregoing arguments in favour of universal dedication affect His Majesty’s Government as the ally of Iraq, but a further strong argument which affects His Majesty’s Government alone is that the Anglo-lraqi alliance may not last indefinitely, and that if it were to.cease to be effective, His Majesty’s Government might find it extremely useful to retain an indisputable right of passage, through, say, Iraqi waters to Abadan. (c) Guarantees ,pf Navigability . 14. In the second place, leaving aside the question of conservancy. Boards.of whatever nature, it is evident that Persia has in reality as great a stake as Iraq in the efficient maintenance of the river and that in normal circumstances she would be exceedingly unlikely to allow any part of the waterway under her control to become unnavigable or dangerous. This does not naturally preclude the possibility of abnormal circumstances arising in which Persia might be unwilling or unable to co-*o]?erate in such essential matters as the dredging of the channel where it (or half of it) passed through-Persian waters. 80 faras the prospective Abadan anchorage was concerned, it might be possible for Iraq t# meet this eventuality by attaching to its transfer to Persia (as is already her intention) the condition that its conservancy should continue, at any rate for a term ©f years, to remain in Iraqi hands. Insistence upon this condition might however wreck the chances of a settlement, ©r at any rate a friendly settlement, and the Iraqi Government would probably be well advised to abandon it, except as regards a transition period of strictly limited duration. It w#uld, however, be reasonable to stipulate that the transition period should in no case terminate before the establishment of a joint conservancy or navigation Beard, whether advisory •r ©therwise (see paragraph 19 below). 15. A more effective guarantee would probably be to make the transfer of the anchorage conditional upon the conclusion ©f a mutual agreement by which the two States would undertake, in such detail an might be thought necessary, t© maintain certain standards of navigability in various parts the river, including the anchorage. It might be possible to embedy a provision in this agreement t© the effect that if either party failed to maintain the stipulated standards, e.g. an regards depth ct water, the other party would have the right t&gt; carry out the necessary v^ork at its own expense. Such a provision, which should be ©f unlimited validity/4 validity, v/«uld c»ver mere inefficiency on •ihe part ^f Persia, and further such inefficiency w*uld probably only •ccur as the result of conditions, such as internal chans, which would in any case make it possible for Iraq, to conduct conservancy nperations in Persian waters without remonstrance, ©r at any rate without active opposition. But it might admittedly n©t be equally possible t© implement it in the event of active Persian ill-will. Except for the possibility that it might in such circumstances be possible to dredge a separate channel through Iraqi waters, the only effective guarantee against this danger is to remove the likelihood of Persian ill-will. The question rf how to do this merges in the question of general policy, 16. A further difficulty of a technical kind would be the danger to shipping which might arise fr&lt;©m divided control inside and outside the anchorage, but it should not prove difficult to devise ad hoc \ ^ measures for avoiding this danger even in the absence of special conservancy and navigation agreements-. (d) The Rooka Channel. , 17-. Before leaving the question of the thalweg frontier opposite Abadan, it is desirable to refer to an important special argument in its favour. This argument is the uncertainty attaching to the sovereignty of the western end ^cf the Rooka Channel. It is true that the -cnly reasonable/ ...reasonable principle for the division territorial waters 'between neighbciiring States (i-.e-. frr the continuation %% the land boundary through the marginal belt of sea till the high seas are reached)- which His Majesty’s Government have been able to discover produces the effect that, if it were apolied at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, it would leave the whole of the Hooka (5) - Channel in Iraqi territorial waters. But although it does not appear likely that any simpler dr juster principle could be devised, His Majesty’s Government cannot be sure that an international tribunal would apply it if the present case came before them. The only certain method of avoiding this danger is to effect a settlement which shall inter alia confirm Iraq in her « title to the whole of the Hooka Channel. The trouble which Persia might make if she were given sovereignty ^ver half the navigable channel opposite Abadan -is negligible compared to the trouble which she eruld make if she were to establish a claim to sovereignty over the •O' whole of the navigable channel at the point where it meets the'open sea* It therefore seems a wise precaution to* Gonjure the greater danger by accepting the lesser. C. Proposal for an Advisory Conservancy and_ Navigation Board . 18. The settlement of the political frontier represents only one half of the Shatt-el-Arab problem. The/ This principle is, briefly, that all points on the line of division*should be equidistant from the coast •f the two States concerned.the other half is the control of conservancy and navigation. As it is now clear that a tripartite Board with executive functions over the whole waterway system is no longer a practical possibility, it will be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to concentrate their efforts on securing the maximum degree of co operation between two governments each independent within its own sphere. This might be achieved by the establishment cf national Boards, with a central co ordinating Board more or less confined to advisory functions. 19. The heads ef an agreement between Persia and Iraq in regard to this question might take the following form:- (1) Each government would be responsible for the control of conservancy and navigation in the waters under its own sovereignty. (2) Each government would fix and spend its own dues, which should be commensurate with services rendered, but arrangements might be made for the collection of these dues at one time and place. Further, &lt;*r alternatively, it might be arranged that the proceeds of the dues should be allocated to Persia and Iraq in certain proportions. It is not anticipated that this purely technical question #f the collection and divisisn of the dues/ ^^If, that is, Persia is only given an anchorage off Abadan: the position is different if a thalweg frontier throughout is envisaged (see paragraph 26 below).'1 u. dues would lead to serious difficulty. (3) The two governments would agree to certain principles, Yi/hich they would each aonly in their own waters 9 •e.g: (a) Equality of treatment for the vessels of all nations. (b) The maintenance of certain specified minimum standards in regard to conservancy. (c) The adoption in all waters of similar rules for shipping and navigation. (4) bach government would have the right to ask the other to undertake on its behalf such work as dredging in waters under its sovereignty, or any part of them, or alternatively to put forward suggestions for the performance of such work by services under joint management. (5) A joint Board would be established, with the assistance of a neutral member representing His majesty s Government), to secure co-rperation between the two Governments and make recommendations in all matters affecting conservancy and navigation, especially (a) ihe control of the flow of the main stream and all neighbouring streams. (b) Dredging. (c) Revetting of banks, etc. W/ v ) This refers to the Karun and is put in the forefront as the mist important duty of all, although the Karun might not be specifically mentioned. The silt and unregulated flow of the Karun is the principal danger to the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab and if its waters could be diverted elsewhere, for whatever purpose, the dredging of the river would be immensely simplified. v,Lighting and Buoying. Pi let age. and control of shipping. Lues. Quarantine and sanitary measures. (6) The two governments would agree to accept a decision of a majority of the Board as binding in the cas^ of a dispute arising out of an alleged breach rf a legally binding obligation with regard to the river (viz. an alleged breach of 3(a) or 3(b) above). 20. These provisions may be regarded as representing the maximum desiderata which His Majesty’s Government can now hope to secure in regard to any scheme for the establishment of an advisory Board (although there is just a possibility that a Board with executive functions f^r the control of shipping, as opposed to conservancy, might prove acceptable to the Persian Government). It must be recognised, hcwever, that it might prove especially difficult to secure the acceptance of point No* (6), in which case it would be necessary to accept a Central Board with functions strictly limited to the making of recommendations, and to coordinating as far as possible the activities of the national Boards. Such a Board would hewever be preferable to' having no joint Board at all, and might in practice exert considerable influence. 21. It must also be recognised that it may not be easy to secure the representation of His Majesty’s Government even on an advisory Board. But His Majesty’s Government would be justified in advising the Iraqi Government that in return for the grant to Persia of a thalweg/ («) (e) (f) (g&gt;thalweg anchorage (or, if the anchorage was already ceded, in return for the termination of the transition period: see paragraph 14 above) they should not only insist on the acceptance «f a joint advisory Board, but should also insist *n this Board being tripartite. The ground for this would be the essential necessity •f having on the Board a neutral member capable of acting as a mediator in the event of differences between the two riparian States, and the inacceptability of any other Power than His Majesty’s Government fwr this purpose in view of the dominant British interest in the shipping using the river. As between His Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government the argument would be, as before, that so long as the Alliance exists it is not only the duty but the interest of Iraq to ensure the co-operation of His Majesty’s Government in the control of a waterway which would be a vital factor in the fulfilment by His Majesty’s Government of their obligations under the Alliance. 22. Another point for consideration is the duration of the agreement. Certain portions of it would necessarily have to be of permanent duration; viz. the dedication of the river to the shipping of the world, the arrangement suggested in Article 15 and points (1)? (3)(a) and 3(b) of Article 19 as a minimum. For this reason it is desirable that all these principles should be embodied in the instrument transferring the Abadan anchorage to Persia. But although the Persian and Irapi Governments might be willing to embody rmct of the above principles, and even the establish lent of a joint advisory Beard, in an agreement of unlimited duration, they/they would be less likely to accept the permanent representation of His Majesty’s Government on the joint Board. It would however be preferable tc avoid if possible any arrangement by which the agreement for a Board continued in force after the provision for the representation of His Majesty’s Government had lapsed. Therefore the provisions for a Board might be contained in a separate instrument of limited duration. Subject tc this, it is clearly desirable that the duration of His Majesty’s Government’s representation should be as long as possible, but hardly essential that it should be longer than, say, twenty or twenty-five years. 23. It should be noted that if an agreement on the lines indicated above is to be accepted by the Persian Government, it is essential that it should be drawn up on a basis of complete equality and reciprucity. I). Alternative Proposals fur a general Thalweg Frontier or a Condominium, with a Conservancy / 1 rr- “T ~ ~ ‘ ' ~ _ ' 1 1-1 Board with Executive functions . 24. In conclusion, it may be useful to examine the probable effects of solutions (4) (a general thalweg frontier), and (5) (a condominium) mentioned in paragraph 5. 25. From the point of view of higher policy, that is to say the establishment of sincere and lasting friendship with Persia, the proposal for a general thalweg frjntier, which would render such relations certain, has everything to^recommend it. Moreover, there is in one sense little to choose between granting Persia a thalweg frontier for a short distance and granting her such a frontier throughout. Again the •adaption cf a thalweg frontier to the open sea would ^ finally/finally dispose of all risk of Persia seeking (possibly with success) to establish a claim to sovereignty ever the while of the Hastern end of the Rooka channel (see . paragraph 17 above). But it must be admitted that for practical purposes the control of Iraq over the Shatt-el- Arab might be much less with a general thalweg frontier than with a thalweg frontipr ,-u £ Aunuior opposite Abakan alone. n or the present, therefore, it is unnecessary to consider this solution m greater detail, although it may be necessary to do so later should the question of tl»e Rooka channel become acute. 26. a general thalweg frontier would, however, have one important result which must not be over-looked. An international conservancy Board with executive functions may be desirable for the Shatt-el-Arab as at present divided between Persia and Iraq, whether a rectification takes place at Abadan or not. But if the frontier were shifted to the centre of the* stream such a Board would become inevitable. It,is in fact impossible to imagine that the conservancy and navigation of the river with such a frontier could be carried on for a day without such joint control, although this would not of course necessarily oblige Persia and Iraq to accept Brutish participation^ Finally it is arguable that the offer a thalweg frontier to the open sea would so change the whole atmosphere, and create so favourable a disposition in Persia, that it would offer far the best means of obtaining the various Iraqi desiderata , such as full freedom of passage, rights of dredging etc.not necessarily be used) has not been studied in any detail, it would have the following advantages; it would simplify all ques'tfens of neutrality, as the river would not be under the exclusive sovereignty of either Power (although it would still be desirable to | provide for a universal dedication of the river to all vessels); it would facilitate the establishment of joint services for conservancy and navigation; and it could be laid down that if the agreement respecting these joint services broke down Iraq and Persia would instantly and automatically resume full and exclusive sovereignty • eer tuose oortions © 1 the river of which they were in possession at the time when the agreement was concluded. On the other hand, it might prove on examination to give rise to various unforeseen difficulties of administration and jurisdiction. 28. The policy which it seems advisable for His Majesty’s Government to adwpt in the light of the forego considerations may be summarised as foll^ws:- (1) To modify the advice hitherto given to the Iraqi (2) To recommend the Iraqi Government, should they grant this concession, to make it conditional upon the acceptance by the Persian Government of:-The points other than Abadan ? the agreement embodying this acceptance to be so drawn as to exclude any possible doubt regarding the title of Iraq to the whole if the Rooka channel. (b) An arrangement whereby the right of passage through the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab ? whether Iraqi or Persian, should be granted in perpetuity ; both in peace and war, to the vessels of war and merchant vessels of all nations at peace with Persia *:r Iraq; or, In the last resort, to vessels of war and merchant vessels belonging to Persia and Iraq and their allies alone. (c) An arrangement whereby each government would undertake to carry out such work in the waters under its control as should be necessary to maintain the river as a safe and efficient waterway adequate to the needs of the shipping desiring normally to make use of it, with the express proviso that in the case of any failure on the part of either government to fulfil these conditions the other government would possess the right to carry out at its Own expense in the waters of the government concerned such work as might be necessary to make good the deficiency. This arrangement should be of unlimited validity,, (d) An arrangement whereby the Iraqi Government might continue its present arrangements with regard to conservancy work and shipping control in the new Abadan anchcrage until such time asthe Persian Government was in a position to undertake these services itself, with the express proviso that this arrangement should in any case continue until the establishment of a joint Board, whether advisory or otherwise, for the control of conservancy and navigation in the river* (3) To recommend the Iraqi Government to leave in abeyance for the present the proposal for a tripartite Conservancy Board Convention on the lines hitherto contemplated, and instead to seek an arrangement with the Persian Government, if possible simultaneously with the grant of the Abadan anchorage, for the control of conservancy and navigation and the establishment of an advisory Board, on the lines indicated in paragraph 19 of the present memorandum; the Board to have compulsory powers, if possible, in the case of breaches of any agreement affecting the river. (4)Te recommend to the favourable consideration of the Persian Government as many of these proposals as may be agreed upon with the Iraqi Government, the time and manner of doing this to be decided at a later stage.'

(i, 7993/10/34) Sir, In your despatch No. 493 of the 31st October (17/190/36) you suggested that His Majesty’s Government should consider whether the inclusion of the waters of the Karun and Bahmanshir among the waters to he placed under the jurisdiction of any international Board established to control the conservancy and navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab was an essential, and not merely a highly desirable , element in the successful establishment of any such Board. 2 . It is probably essential, if the Sha tt-el-Arab is to be preserved as a first-class waterway, that steps should sooner or later be taken to regulate the flow of; water and mud from the Karun, but it would no doubt be possible for these steps to be taken without the establishment of a tripartite conservancy Board controlling the whole of the Shatt-el-Arab system of waterways. To this extent, therefore, it is correct that the inclusion of the Karun and/ H.J.Seymour Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O., # etc . , etc. , ■ etc . Tehran.and Bahmanshir among the waters to be cjntrolled by a Shatt-el-Arab Board, although highly desirable, is not absolutely essential. In any case, if the Persian Government are determined not to place the harun and Bahmanshir under any form of international control, it appears desirable to face this fact and consider other alternatives. A memorandum has accordingly been prepared in my department reviewing the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the frontier dispute, and this memorandum, which makes various suggestions for the settlement of the dispute on the assumption that the Karun and Bahmanshir cannot be brought under international control, is intended to form the basis of inter-departmental discussions, of the outcome of vv'hich you will be informed in due course. A copy of the Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) memorandum is being sent to you separately. 4.

W. 1. Reference to previous correspondence (if any) :\ Your despatch No 577 j_of November 25th: Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute]. I regret that it/was impracticable to send earlier reply to your telegram No. 29 Saving [of November 7th]. Iraqi Note appears merely to anticipate programme contemplated in dis cussions between Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Nuri Pasha in event of failure to reach comprehensive settlement by next March. Wording of item 3 in procedure which it suggests seems liable to give impression that Iraqi Government have abandoned stipulation that Conservancy Convention shall be tripartite. Otherwise I have little to add to your observa tions and to comments contained in Mr. Seymour’s telegram No. 204 [of November 12th]. But in case you may be consulted in the near future, following considerations are sent for your guidance. 2. His Majesty*s Government still consider that arrange ments for unified - or at least co-ordinated - technical control of whole waterway system will be essential if a lasting and satisfactory settlement is to be reached. Soundest course might therefore be to continue to attempt to reach comprehensive settlement to include such arrangements, particularly as cession of Abadan anchorage may prove strongest lever in hands of Iraqis for securing Persian acceptance of conservancy arrangements and it seems unwise to give this point away in advance. But His Majesty's Government are now as always sincerely anxious to see early liquidation of Perso-Iraqi dispute, and do not wish to hamper or delay any initiative to this end or designed to narrow...X / # 2 . narrow down points of conflict, provided British interests are not adversely affected thereby. 3. iaain British interest is to secure satisfactory con ditions for shipping using the Shatt, since over 90.o of this is British. Hence desire of His Majesty's Government for tripartite Conservancy Convention. His Majesty's Government also have important political and military interest in ensuring that solution of Shatt question shall not be such as adversely to affect their obligations to Iraq under the Treaty of Alliance, this may be affected by any frontier settlement and particularly bj o* anch.,.,age at Abadan about which Admiralty views are already mown to Iraqi Government. It would in any case be desirable for Iraqi Government to obtain a treaty undertaking from Persian Government to allow free passage of all merchant and war vessels through any Persian water in the Shatt both in peace and war (see on this point Mr. Rendel's letter of December 2 ord, 1935). Safeguards would also be required regarding dredging, but it seems doubtful whether, once anchorage wls recognised, as Persian water, these would be enforceable in event of serious dispute. 4. Ii negotiations for arrangements for future control and conservancy of Shatt are postponed, and Abadan anchorage conceded meanwhile,, some erasures to avoid dangers to shipping arising irom dual jurisdiction will also be necessary. re g?rds thalweg frontier, Admiralty are still most ,fX ou ? to . avoid, cession of anchorage of more than one hundr-pa S lYu VY 1 £i th ? lnce the y still regard it as ess“tia! that shins wa?er This asSofof ^ tho ^ passing through Persian S'2 n “ff ant that ea again as to precise nature of 'safeguards' on which Irani CnM ernment would have to insist in returnXor fny cession of tMs Addressed to Bagdad No. 12 Saving, ... .

He said that even if Persian Government went to the Hague Court and judgement was given against them they could never acquiesce in the present situation in the ohatt-el- arab. He also made it clear that Persian Government remain opposed to participation of His Majesty s Government in any convention respecting navigation or conservancy and repeated as he has said before ths.t Yasin Pasha had told him Iraqi Government also did not desire British participation. On this point I said I could not hold out any expectation that attitude of His Majesty's Government would be modified. As regards general question I pointed out that Iraqi Government had now made a new proposal to Persian Government and enquired whether His Excellency thought it possible to proceed, at any rate to a settlement of frontier question. He said he had not yet had time to study Iraqi note, but his personal opinion was that a settlement of frontier and Abadan questions mi^it be possible if agreement could be reached on width of Abadan anchorage ana provided certain cognate questions were settled at least m principle at the same time. Amongst these would be freedom ofof navigation for ships of all countries, control of shipping, % dues not to he in excess of services rendered. Details could be left for later treatment if agreement in principle could be reached. As regards width of anchorage, His Excellency seems to take view that width should be 'as at Mohammerah', i.e., half the river. I expressed hope that Persian Government would take opportunity now afforded to reach settlement of frontier question which would in itself be an important step towards improvement of relations with Ira&lt;p&lt;. Discussion was amicable throughout but His Excellency did refer at one point to possibility that prolongation of these discussions might affect relations between His Majesty's Government and Persian Government on other questions.

J. Edmonds. H. E. Dr. Naji Ali Asil.DRAFT LETTER TO THE MINISTER OF IRAN. My dear Minister, The consolidation of relations of genuine friendship and cordial cooperation between Iraq and Iran being an essential part of the foreign policy of the Iraqi Government, I lost no time, after my assumption of office, in examining thoroughly the various matters which have recently been under discussion between our two governments. I understood from my predecessor, H.E. Saiyid Nuri as Said, that at your interview with him on October 20th Your Excellency intimated to him that your government was anxious to settle the frontier question immediately, on the basis of the proposals of H.I.M. the Shah. We are anxious to settle all other outstanding matters as soon as possible. Nevertheless, in view of the necessities of the world situation, and in order to make possible the signature of the Non-Aggression Pact before 21st March 1937, as earnestly desired by all the Parties, I am of opinion that the most satisfactory procedure would be as follows: 1. To conclude as soon as possible a treaty settling the question of the boundary on the basis proposed by H.I.M. the Shah, viz: (a) the recognition by Iran of the original boundary throughout its length from the Turkish frontier to the open sea, and (b) the grant by Iraq to Iran of an anchorage at Abbadan, subject to certain safeguards regarding freedom of navigation through the anchorage in all circumstances of peace and war, and regarding the rights of dredging. 2. To proceed, immediately after the signature of the abovementioned treaty, to the signature of the pact of Non- Aggression by our two countries and by Turkey and Afghanistan. Each • • •3. Each of the two governments to undertake to open negotiations, immediately after the signature of the above- mentioned Pact, for the conclusion of a Convention regarding Navigation and Conservancy in the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. The two governments to agree to negotiate as soon as possible a series of conventions which are necessary in order to place all other aspects of the relations between our two countries on a firm conventional basis, these conventions being: A Neighbourly Relations Convention, a Residence and Nationality Convention, a Consular Convention, an Extradition Convention, a Convention for judicial assistance, and a Post and Telegraph Convention. the matter is referred to in a recent letter from Your excellency to my predecessor, that throughout these negotiations each government has repeatedly made it clear it reserves all its rights and maintains all the contentions which it made before the Council of the League of Nations; that remains understood and there is no need to repeat this reservation on each occasion of an exchange of views. Your Excellency’s Government I am prepared to commence at once the discussion of the various points of detail and the drafting of the text of the first Treaty mentioned. In conclusion I desire to say, since I note that that, until such time as a new agreement has been reached. If the above suggestions commend themselves toNO DISTRIBUTION.

The minister of Foreign Affaire,in diecuesing the prospects of the new Government, told me that from the Iranian point of view the most satis factory methtion would he the emergence of a Government in Iraq possessing real authority. In Rig ixcellency *e view, previous Governments in Iraq have felt insecure in their tenure of power,with the result that they have been disin clined to commit themselves to any definite decision in their negotiations with foreign countries.

This presumably implies that the Iranian Government do not now anticipate any substantial help from His Majesty's Government in securing an agreement on terms acceptable to them. I have thought it better not to raise the question on my side until the Iraqi Government have replied to the last Persian note* 2. It is generally accepted here that the Shah will never agree to any settlement which includes any part of the Karun and the Bahmanshir in the waters to be controlled by an inter-national Board. I understood in Baghdad that, while the inclusion of these rivers in the proposed convention was certainly highly desirable, it was not technically essential. In the meantime the building of the Trans-Iranian Railway progresses, and its completion may well bring to the fore again the question of improving the port facilities at Bandar Shahpur. How this will affect the Shatt question must at present be a matter of conjecture, but, if there is then still no Iranian anchorage at Abadan, it is not likely to make a settlement easier* 3. If His Majesty's Government should desire to try some fresh approach to the subject it might be worth examining whether/ Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P. etc., e tc., etc ., the Foreign Officewhether the inclusion of the Karun and Bahmanshir is so important as to be a sine q ua non for any agreement. If the inclusion of these rivers is held to be really essential, there would seem to be little prospect of drafting an agreement to which the Shah would consent — even supposing the numerous other points at dispute to be successfully surmounted. 4* I aiT1 sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty r s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 90.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copy of a note by Mr. Sterndale Bennett, dated the 28th September, respecting a conversation with Nuri Pasha on the Turkish attitude towards the Perso-Jraqi frontier. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, September 30, 1936. Enclosure. Note by Mr. Sterndale Bennett respecting a Conversation with Nuri Pasha on the Turkish Attitude towards the Perso-lraqi Frontier. NURI PASHA has asked me to inform the Secretary of State of a recent development in this question. 2. It will be remembered that one of the chief objects of Nuri Pasha’s recent visit to Turkey was to enlist the support of the Turkish Government in promoting a settlement of the Perso-lraqi frontier question. The direct Turkish interest in the question is that it is holding up the signature of the non-aggression treaty between Turkey, Iraq, Persia and Afghanistan which was initialled in Geneva in October last year, the Iraqis having taken up the position that they could only sign the treaty when their frontier difficulty with Persia had been cleared up. 3. Nuri Pasha and M. Aras had hoped to have the opportunity of further conversations with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Geneva during the present session of the Assembly. As the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs is not here, however, M. Aras sent a telegram to the Turkish representative in Tehran three days ago, and Nuri Pasha understands the telegram to have been on the following lines :— 4. The Turkish Government would be willing to postpone the signature of the non-aggression treaty until March 1937, in order to give time for further negotiations between Iraq and Persia on the basis of {a) the Shah’s willingness, as expressed during Nuri Pasha’s visit to Tehran in August 1935, to accept the existing frontier in the Shatt, provided that Persia received an anchorage at Abadan; and (5) the elaboration of a convention to regulate the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab and the details of navigation in that waterway. If a comprehensive settlement should not be reached by March 1937, the Turkish Government would press the Iraqi Government to sign the non-aggression treaty in return for the acceptance by the Persian Government of the existing frontier, subject to their receiving an anchorage at Abadan, and for an undertaking, to be embodied in a protocol between Iraq and Persia, to continue negotiations for a conservancy and navigation convention. 5. The form which M. Aras’s message took was understood by Nuri Pasha to be that the above was the procedure which M. Aras proposed to press upon the Iraqi Government if the Persian Government agreed. But M. Aras’s intention was, in fact, to press both Governments equally and to act as mediator. (6. I gather from Mr. MacDougall, the British legal adviser to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, whom I asked to elucidate some of what Nuri Pasha f840 e—11had told me in rather involved language, that the above does not mean that the Traais have committed themselves in any way to an anchorage at Abadan 4 kilom. in length and up to the medium f.lum as the Persians claim.) 7 Nuri Pasha has telegraphed the substance of Af. Aias s demavchs to the Iraqi representative in Tehran, with instructions to take no action, but to watch the matter closely. He suggested that it would be advisable to telegraph it also to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran for his confidential information. But he would be grateful, in addition, if the Secretary of State would do him the service of takiner an opportunity to mention the matter to M. ^- ias - He suggested that the Secretary of State should take the line that he had heard that M. Aras had taken a step on the above lines, and that, m view of the well-known interest of His Maiesty’s Government in this problem, he would t&gt;e glad to have infor mation on the point from M. Aras himself. Nuri Pasha s object appears to be twofold. In the first place, he does not seem entirely to trust M Aras and would like confirmation of what he has actually said. In the second P la ce, he feels that M Aras would be more definitely committed to the line which he has taken up if he makes the communication to the Secretary of State, and not merely to Nuri Pasha himself. Nuri Pasha did not put his motives so clearly m speaking to me, and I am only inferring them from the somewhat ambiguous words that he used.

If a comprehensive settlement could not be reached by March 1937 Turkish Government would press Iraqi Government to sign non-aggression treaty without further delay, provided Persian Government would then accept forthwith existing Turkey, Persia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Following their recent conversations at Istanbul, Turkish and Iraqi Ministers lor Foreign Affairs had hoped for further Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. In latter’s absence, Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs according to Nuri Pasha frontier,frontier, subject to receiving anchorage at Abadan, and would further undertake in a protocol or exchange of notes to continue negotiations for a conservancy and navigation convention. Nuri Pasha has telegraphed this information to Iraqi representative at Tenran with instructions to take no action but to watch situation carefully. He has asked that His Majesty’s Chargd d'affaires at Tehran might be similarly informed. -l understand tnat while procedure proposed in M. Aras’ telegram is to ce put to the Persian Government as something which the Turkish Crovernnent are prepared to urge Iraqi government to accept if Persian Government agree, Nuri Pasha has already informed LI.

Q ^ 6 August 24, 1936. A CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. E 5336/481/93] Copy No. 117 Mr. Bateman to Mr. Eden.—{Received August 24.) (No. 398 E.) Sir, ^ Bagdad, August 1, 1936. IN my despatch No. 357 E. o f the 15th July last, statistics were furnished showing the financial worlang oi me Port of Basra and of the Fao Bar Dredging Scheme for the year ended the 31st March, 1936. 2. I have now the honour to transmit to you the budget estimates in abridged form of these two undertakings for the financial year 1936-37.(') 3. The total estimated revenue of the port is higher by some I.D. 36,000 than the estimate for 1935-36. Several factors have contributed to this increase. The inclusion of a full year’s provision for sanitary dues has helped to swell the marine revenues by some I.D. 11,000. In 1935-36, although provision for three months’ collection of these dues was inserted in the estimate, no dues were in fact received, as the necessary enabling legislation had not been enacted. The position is unaltered in this respect, but it is hoped that parliamentary sanction wull shortly be obtained. 4. Traffic revenue is estimated to produce I.D. 6,000 more than in 1935-36, in anticipation of increased import tonnage, whilst miscellaneous revenues account for an increase of a further I.D. 6,000, derived in the main from anticipated recoveries, from the Central Power House and Central Water Purification Scheme, on account of service of capital debt. 5. On the expenditure side the estimates are also higher by I.D. 36,000. This increase is due in part to the enhanced provision made (under £C Salaries ”) to cover the cost of the additional staff required to run the airport, and in part to the expenditure required in connexion with the airport and the Central Water Purification Scheme, which have not previously figured in budget estimates. For the rest, provision has been inserted, on a conservative scale, for increased expenditure resulting from the growing activity of the port. Provision is also made for the payment of I.D. 33,360, the thirteenth annual instalment of the capital debt, including interest due to His Majesty’s Government. 6. Estimates of receipts and expenditure of the Eao Bar Dredging Scheme are both lower by approximately I.D. 32,000. On the basis of actual collections in 1935-36, it is estimated that dredging dues for the current financial year would amount to I.D. 150,000, but allowance has been made for a contemplated reduction of 3 per cent, in the scale of charges, and revenue from this source is therefore estimated at I.D. 171,000. 7. In the estimates of expenditure no provision for new dredgers, such as appeared in the estimates for the preceding year (I.D. 62,000) is inserted, although I understand that Colonel Ward has, in fact, secured the Prime Minister’s consent to the purchase of a fourth dredger. All other heads show increases, the most important of which are I.D. 10 550 for renewals and repairs, and I.D. 9,500 for mino r works. In the former case adequate provision has been made for the proper maintenance of the three existing dredgers. Minor works include additional beacons and lights to be installed, at an estimated cost of I.D. 2,500, in the dredged channel, and the provision at Fao of facilities (also estimated to cost I.D. 2,500) for minor repairs to and overhaul of port craft, hitherto dependent in this respect on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan. 8.

WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 168 and 169 of the 7th and the 8 th July respectively, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith translations of the following notes addressed by Nuri Said to the Iranian Minister in Bagdad :— {a) Note of the 11 th July. (5) Note of the 13th July. 2 . The first of these communications asks for a classification of the claim to sovereignty in the Shatt-el-Arab made by the Iranian Minister in his note of the 5th July last (see my despatch No. 338 of the 8 th July). The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs adopted my suggestion that it would be well for them to deal promptly with this aspect of the matter so as to prevent the Iranian Minister from pleading, later on, that by failing to comment the Iraqi Govern ment had allowed the claim to go by implication. I now learn that, when tackled on this point by Nuri Said, the Iranian Minister first said that his note hau been badly translated but, being fairly cornered, he admitted that he had inseited the claim to sovereignty on orders from Tehran. His equivocation and shifty behaviour have made him extremely unpopular with the Iraqi Government, anc the Prime Minister has now insisted that all his verbal communications must, in future, be addressed exclusively to Nuri Said. . n i 3 . The second note was drafted by Mr. MacDougall and is intended primarily to answer the Persian complaint about the establishment of an Iiaqi quarantine station and the granting of pratique at Pao. It includes, however (paragraph 5), an emphatic rebuttal of the Iranian claim to sovereignty ovei national Iraqi waters in the Shatt and invites attention to the fact (paragiaph /) that Iranian incursions over the frontier have disturbed the status quo. I understand that it is the intention of Nuri Said to address yet a further note to the Iranian Government on this last point. &gt; 4. The Iraqi Government were anxious, if possible, to have the advice ot His Maiesty’s Government as to the best manner in which to answer the Iranian note of the' 5 th July, but they found themselves obliged, more especially m view of the threatening movement of the Iranian forces in the vicinity of Pen] win, to consider the matter as urgent and to deal with the question involved m the manner and order described above. . . ^ ^ 5 It seems clear that the Iranian Government are reverting to the aggressive policy of 1934 which ended in the Iraqi appeal to the Council of the League in December 1934. 6 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s Charge d Affaiies at Tehran. _ , D I have, &amp;c.

Bagdad, July 13, 1936. t;ir ’ T H WE the honour to refer to my note of the 11th July, 1936, acknowledging the receipt of your Excellency's note of the 5th July, 1936, and commenting upon cert am ^deiand^made by your Excellency that instructions be issued to the officials of the Royal Iraqi Government to abstain from any kind o unilateral step in the matter of sanitary inspection of ships in the Shatt-el-Ara 2 demand were I not .till Uopolul that l&gt;v ol.n.g , 1 . obiervations which follow an obvious misconception on the part of the Imperial Iranian Government might be removed and the discussions going on between the two Governments might come to a successful conclusion. 3 As a party to the International Sanitary Convention, Iraq is not only entitled but bound', to take measures for the sanitary inspection of ships entering Iraqi territory. Such measures, so far from affording any ground for complaint, should be a cause of satisfaction to other Governments and particularly to the Government of a country which, like Iran, is a neighbour of Iraq and also a party to this convention.' Without going further than article 8 of the convention, y 0ur ' Excellency will find the following provision “ xhe prompt and scrupulous fulfilment of the foregoing provisions being of primary importance, Governments recognise the necessity of giving instructions in regard to their application to the appropriate authorities. The provisions referred to are those contained in articles 1 to 7 of the convention and the Royal Iraqi authorities are clearly entitled and out sanitary inspections of ships in the Shatt-el Arab to ±ul S s j national obligations contained in these provisions Any instructions in g to the application of these provisions which have been given by the Royjil Iraq Government to the appropriate authorities have been given in accordance the necessity expressly recognised by the Governments ot states signi „ ivention, which includes the Governments of both Iraq and I 1 an. 4 . The suggestion that measures taken or to be taken by the ^ Authorities for the sanitary inspection of ships in the Shatt-el-Ara inconsistent with articles 52 and 66 of the convention appears to „ foundation. The first paragraph of article 52 applies to ‘‘territorial &gt; an expression which, moreover, is to be understood “ in its stricti} J J sense.' It is, therefore, as plain as words can make it that that parage the article has no application to the national waters of Iraq. It may 3 e that any ship which enters the Shatt-el-Arab has passed the coasts oi 4 | e has entered Iraqi territory, and that paragraph is, therefore, doubly inapi The second paragraph subjects ships calling in a port or on the coast toi e- &lt; ’ of Iraq to the sanitary laws and regulations of the country 7 to wine ^ or coast belongs, that is to say, Iraq. A fortiori, a ship which has P as _ ^ coast of Iraq by entering the Shatt-el-Arab is subjected to suenIn a ,4 n:: it uroflfii 3 it 2 {!Eiri tk ik ® 1 : regulations of Iraq, and article 52, so far from being inconsistent with measures of sanitary inspection of ships in the Shatt-el-Arab taken by the Royal Iraqi authorities, actually reiterates and re-enforces Iraq’s right to take such measures. 5. With regard to article 66 , if your Excellency is suggesting that that article modifies in any way the sovereign rights of Iraq over its national waters in the Shatt-el-Arab, I cannot too emphatically reject the suggestion. of both parties in the Council of the League of Nations which you stated in the following terms :— That they would not proceed to any step that might cause a complication of the affair until such time as the existing differences are removed. The rapporteur, Baron Aloisi, stated on the 25th May, 1935, that: — At the last session, the parties undertook, in the Council, to refrain from doing anything in the meantime that might render the settlement of the dispute more difficult. Whichever form of words your Excellency relies upon, I cannot imagine how they can be construed as applying to routine measures of sanitary inspection of ships in Iraqi national waters, 7. I take the present opportunity of informing your Excellency that renewed aggressions committed by the Imperial Iranian Authorities by the election of police posts on the Iraqi side of the land frontier compel me to consider steps to bring these definite breaches by the Imperial Iranian Authorities of the under taking referred to in the preceding paragraph to the notice of the Council of the League of Nations.

THE Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to the Imperial Persian Legation, Bagdad, and have the honour to inform them that Persian frontier officials continue actively to penetrate into Iraqi territory in spite of the promises which have been given by the Persian Government on many occasions to the effect that Persian officials would not be allowed to violate the Iraqi frontier. The Ministry have the honour to transmit the following information of a fresh incident which recently occurred, which they feel is not in harmony with the spirit of friendship which they desire should be maintained between the two countries. On the 5th June, 1936, twenty-nine Persian soldiers crossed the frontier m the neighbourhood of the village of Banawa Suta and camped within Iiaqi territory. The Mudir of the Penj win Nahiya visited the commander of this Persian detachment and warned him of the fact that he had entered Iraqi territory. The Persian commander thereupon undertook to withdraw the soldiers across the frontier, but instead of carrying out this promise by returning to Persian territory, he increased the strength of his detachment to fifty men. This force then proceeded to build a post on the north-east of the village ot Banawa Suta. . . 1 AT , The Iraqi Frontier Commissioner at Halebja, m his letters Nos. 671 ana C/706 dated the 7th and 18th June, 1936, respectively, invited the attention of the Persian Frontier Commissioner at Nausud to this violation of Iraqi territory, and requested that orders should be given for the withdrawal of this Peisian detachment. Unfortunately, this demarche did not lead to the desned lesults, and the Persian detachment is still established within Iraqi territory.

I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 427 E. of the 1st August, 1935, and to inform you that I have now received from Colonel Ward an advance typewritten copy of the Administration Report of the Port of Basra, including a report on the Fao dredging scheme, for the financial year 1935-36. Printed copies of the report will be transmitted to you when they are available. 2. Details of budget estimates and actual revenue and expenditure during the year are set forth in the enclosures in this despatch, together with com parative figures of actual expenditure in the preceding year. 3. It will be seen that the revenue of the port, while falling short by some T4,300 of that earned in 1934-35, exceeded the budget estimate by about T20,000. This excess is accounted for almost in its entirety by increased traffic revenue and miscellaneous receipts. The earnings of the traffic depart ment exceeded expectations by &lt;£12,900, largely as a result of increased imports of materials destined for the Royal Air Force station at Dhibban and of constructional material for the Kut barrage. Miscellaneous revenue was swollen by receipts on account of the sale of surplus craft and material, for which no budget provision was made. Receipts in the Marine Department, while approaching closely the budget estimate, were lower by about £ 10,000 than in 1934-35. This decrease was brought about in its entirety by the reduction in dues u A ” by 2 fils per gross registered ton as from the 1st April, 1935. 4. Expenditure was greater by about £4,000 than the budget estimate, and by £12,000 than that for the preceding year. This increase was due to the introduction of the new form of contract for foreign officials serving in the port directorate, in consequence of which the leave accounts of all such officials had to be liquidated. 5 . The Fao bar dredging scheme shows a surplus on the year’s working of £8,522, as compared with an estimated surplus of £455. Dredging dues have declined by over £40,000 as compared with 1934-35. This decrease is not due to a falling off in the number of vessels entering and .leaving the port, or to a diminution of their draft, but to the reduction of 15 per cent, in the scale of dues introduced on the 1st April, 1935. Expenditure under the several headings has been within or very slightly in excess of the budget estimates, with the exception of renewals and repairs, where the over-expenditure of some £ 4,000 is due to the cost of dry-docking a dredger, which proved more extensive than was anticipated. 6 .

In an attempt to clarify the position the Iraq Government addressed a note to the Persian Government on June 23rd setting out three alternative proposals for a settlement of the dispute. These are:- (1) a tripartite Board on the British model (i.e. control over navigation as well as over dredging and maintenance of the river), with control over the last three miles of the Karum and the whole of the Bahw^nashir, plus the cession of the water front at Ahadan; (2) tripartite Board to control navigation only leaving the dredging^/conservancy of Iraqi waters in Iraqi hands, and of Persian waters in Persian hands, hut eaeii would advise the separate national Conservancy Authorities; plus the cession/ -—— cession of the water front at Abadan; (3) no Board at all and merely the cession of the water front at Abadan. The Foreign Office consider that the reference to British participation in the Board is not sufficiently strongly expressed, but otherwise the document is statesmanlike. So far as we can judge up to date, the Persian reply is not going to be helpful. They will demand a mediae line for the Ahadan anchorage, insist on a Conservancy Commission with very full powers, from which, however, the Karum and Baiu^ajrfshir will he excluded. As regards British participation, they are taking up a truly Persian attitude and are trying to escape from their former undertakings in regard to British participation in the negotiation and signature of the Convention. On the whole it seems that the Persian Government have given up all hope of reaching a settlement of the Shatt-el-Arab question satisfactory to themselves. They apparently contemplate developing the Bahtfa^shir, hut in the meantime they have returned to violent methods / and have lodged a protest against the recent Iraqi quarantine regulations on the ground^ that it violates their sovereignty over the Shatt-el- Arah. It seems likely that the whole question will he referred hack to Geneva without any progress having been made, hut the Foreign Office are anxious that the Iraq Government should '1k\. /&lt;A1* plU U' ^ t Kft/i !!5S[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] ^ (S 4360/10/54) : &gt; L TO Code telegrem to Mr. Cutler j ..orsign Office ? 1st August, 1956. 10.r-5 n.m. o o do vR; '7 iour telegram g-'-u.

In conversation with me, Nuri Said said that, following upon his return to Bagdad, he had had a number of discussions with the Iranian Minister and had reached the conclusion that no progress would be possible so long as the negotia tions were conducted as at present. He had therefore decided, with the consent of the Council of Ministers, to bring matters to a head, and the enclosed note was the result of his negotiations. 3. On the 24th June the Iranian Minister called upon me and, after some preliminary small talk, embarked upon a loud and vehement complaint about the language of the Iraqi note. As he was disposed to accuse the Iraqi Government of tergiversation and to lay upon them all the blame for the delays which had occurred, I thought it well to disabuse him of the idea that the Iraqis exercised any monopoly in this connexion. 4. I attach a note of my conversation. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran. * SOME time has lapsed without the negotiations between the delegations having been brought to a conclusion, notwithstanding the existence on both sides of goodwill and a desire for a settlement of outstanding differences. Although the great Shah personally intervened in the matter in August of last year and ended the frontier difierence on the basis of full recognition of the entire frontier from the north down to the sea and the cession of an anchorage adequate to meet the needs of Abadan, it is to be regretted that the negotiations which have been proceeding on this basis have so far yielded no fruit. We believe that, unless the points of difference are set down in writing and the replies examined in a spirit of frankness, these negotiations will only result in a loss of time and the growth of a feeling of discontent and complaint not to be contem plated by the statesmen of the two neighbouring kingdoms. 1 . Before proceeding to discuss and delimitate the Abadan anchorage, the Iraqi Government desire to explain their opinion on the question of a Navigation Commission, and they request the Iranian Government in reply to state, with complete frankness, their own view on this subject in order that the negotiators may be able to proceed with their work. 2. The Navigation Commission can only be constituted of three members. A larger number would tend to place control of the matter in foreign hands, while a smaller number, namely, two members, cannot normally form a commission. The only State interested in the matter is Britain, who, Iran has agreed, should have a member on the commission. Great Britain, however, will not, it appears, agree to have a member on such commission unless she is a signatory to the instrument I have, &amp;c. C. H. BATEMAN. Enclosure 1 .

Record of Conversation between Mr. Bateman and Iranian Minister m Bagdad on June 24. THE Persian Minister called this morning. It was quite clear that he had come to talk about the attached note, which was sent yesterday to him uy : Pasha. After a lot of beating about the bush, he came to the point, wiiicn w that in sub-paragraph 1 of the note, no mention was made of an a g reemen A t K w i he alleged to have been reached regarding the length of the anchorage at ADa • He said that the experts (Colonel Ward and Colonel Bayandor) had recommended a 4-mile anchorage, the Iraqi Government had agreed, and Sir A. Gariy a had assured him that this part of the business could be considered as c0 ^ lu i( j The only other outstanding point about the anchorage w r as the width, r 16 .,, that, of course, his Government claimed the medium filum aquae, and tha 1 was to be a conciliator, as he wanted to be, and get his Government to a J&gt; ie i, accept a quarter of the river, he must have something to show for it. tie already reported that the Iraqi Government had accepted an anchorage 4 mi e length, and his grievance was that this ought to have appeared in the Iraqi no ^ ' I contested his argument on the following lines : In the first place, i “ quite clear that the Iraqi note was intended to clear the air on principles, details. The omission of any given point from such a document dm necessarily mean that the Iraqi Government were going back on any prom3 IS8^( •tenaiinp ■v Tl the ^(b. vera vratp ^hr aMyi^v., ^Snallyfe igtodiri- no catfagr, j ?oifc K? - lentkasfe 'mix i? ^ ■seoneesia laq.f^eii roin tfe ask lepsiaafe oveniMi id Goversse ?e up y id order t t event, eont' ind ImM* they had made, if, in fact, they had made it. In any case, was it anything to be proud of that, after nearly a year’s confab, this was the only positive point of agreement that could figure in the document? I then added that the reason why the Iraqi Government wanted to bring the question to a head was that there had been so much misunderstanding as a result of verbal conversations that they l_ \ l ia d decided that they could no longer go on on these lines. Only this morning the Minister for Foreign Affairs had drawn my attention to one grave misunder standing under which the Persian Minister was apparently labouring. He (the Persian Minister) had told Nuri that, according to what the Ambassador had told him, the British Government would have no objection to an agreement reached d deux between the Iraqi and Persian Governments, even if it included questions concerning the Shatt-el-Arab. I said that this was a most unfortunate misunderstanding, which must be cleared up at once. All that the Ambassador had told him was that, if there was a likelihood of the two Governments arriving by their own unaided efforts at an agreement on the frontier alone, then His Majesty’s Government would not wish to hinder (“ entraver ”) the conclusion of such an agreement. If, on the other hand, both Governments were considering a comprehensive settlement, including questions concerning the Shatt-el-Arap then His Majesty’s Government would insist on— (a) Being a party to the negotiations; (b) Signature of the relative agreement; and (c) An executive place on a tripartite board. As the Minister was inclined to hedge and put the blame anywhere but on himself, and in order that there should be no further misunderstanding, I repeated this with emphasis on the word &lt;£ insist,” and the Minister assured me that he had now got the point. He looked very sheepish, and I fancy that if there was a misunderstanding he was responsible for it himself. As he seemed disposed to argue that I could see no reason in the Persian case (a point on which I made no effort to disillusion him), I thought fit to go back to first principles. I remarked that he had talked a lot about Persian “ droits ” and “ revendications.” I then asked him why, if they were so sure of themselves, were his Government so scared of The Hague ? Who had started the row, in fact ? I said there was far too great a tendency in the world to-day to fabricate fictitious cases and then plead them in justification for redress, and it was about time the process ceased. It was all very well to have “ revendications,” but they had got to be bien fondees if anyone with a spark of reason was going to listen to them. I took this line rather because the Minister argued that there was no disputing the fact that, at the mouth of the river, the Iranians had already got the medium fdum aquae. I said I saw nothing about the medium fdum aquae at the mouth of the river in the 1914 protocol (which the Minister kept quoting like a well-trained parrot) or in the Erzerum Treaty; and even if such mention had appeared, I understood it to be the wish of the Persian Government that these instruments should be conveniently forgotten. Were they going to deny the same £ £ Nelson ’ ’ tactics to the Iraqis ? I tried to make him see that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander, but I am convinced that we are going to have trouble when the question of the approaches from the sea come to be discussed. The Minister came with his usual bland bonhomie, but departed in more serious mood, and with a veiled threat to the effect that the dispute could not be allowed to remain as it was (a point on which I agreed), and that if the Iraqis did not do something soon the consequences might be serious. I told him that there was no need to take a tragic view, that the Iraqis had so far taken the initiative and it was now for him to act.

Any action contrary to this arrangement would not be in conformity with the sovereignty of Iran over the 3hatt~al- Arab, would constitute a contravention of the provisions of Articles 52 and 66 of the International .Sanitary convention, and would be the subject of a severe protest on the part of my Cover ament. I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration and esteem.9 c • e- c • o 'This Document is th e Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the F oreign Office if not required for official use.] — ( _ 1 TO IRAQ I f; o a 9 (B 4275/10/34) Cypher telegram to Mr. Bateman (Bagdad).

It is also at least irguable that right of free navigation in Article 2 of Treaty of irzerum implies exemption from dues or other interference for Persian craft in transit through Iraqi waters, 3. Reference to sovereignty in Persian note is of course mwarranted, but Persian Government have for many years oeen saying that half river is or at any rate ought to be their property, and so long as they merely go on saying this and do not proceed go deeds, I do not think an impartial observer would feel tlmt any oreach status quo agreement was involved,2 , 4. For these reasons I suggest that Iraqi reply should be restricted to brief statement on lines of second paragraph of your telegram under reference with possible omission oi mention of ^ rights 5 h 5. As regards police posts, I agree that these are on totally different footing and if Iraqi Government are sure of their facts breach of status pup agreement has occurredo But unless these posts are likely to lead to serious local trouble, it seems unnecessary to refer frontier question as a whole back zo League at this stage, Best procedure may be to attempt in first place to secure withdrawal of posts through diplomatic channel taking particular care that tone of any note is one of studied moderation. 6 . Question of reference back to Council is dealt witn in my immediately following telegram. Addressed to Bagdad ho, 154, repeated to Tehran No. 81.^his Docum ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government; and should'be j -I T71 : m «nnviinAf] -FrtM nffi f&gt;l Q1 11 CO 1 immediately preceding telegrain [of July 18th: Perso-Iraqi frontier dispate]. If Persian Government are indeed determined to make difficul ties ? it is essential that Iraqi Government should keep their heads behave studiously correctly, and remember that Persian Government can only harm their own case by violent methods. 2. It would in my opinion be premature to refer whole question back to League Council before reply has been received to Nuri Pasha's note of June 25rd 0 This note (of which I have now received text) seems with one exception to be a well-devised document which sets forth Iraqi position fairly and clearly and if (as Tehran telegrams Nos. 155 to 157 ^of July 10th and 11th] suggest is pos sible) Persian reply proves so unsatisfactory as to render further direct discussions impossible, Iraqi Government should be able to return to League on a good wicket so far as matters concerned in note are concerned. If, however, reply affords any basis at all for further direct discussions it would be well for these dis cussions to continue. In particular, since Iraqi note gave no details of proposed Abadan anchorage, it would be advisable to deal with any Persian complaints on this score before breaking off direct discussions and also (to avoid future misunderstandings and charges of bad faith) to indicate clearly whether or not statements in present note (that dredging etc. will continue on returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] IP ‘ k 1 4275/10/54). To IRAQ. Cypher telegram to Mr. Bateman. (Bagdad;. oOo- present . « o e isi 2 . present basis ? in absence of a Conservancy Convention) me an that Iraq will continue to dredge any water ceded to form an anchorage 0 o. furthermore, present note does not cover all matters in dispute and if whole question is eventually referred back to Council it is important that Iraqi government should be able to convince rapporteur and Council with chapter and verse that they are willing and able to provide remedies on all points in which existing frontier is a source of practical inconvenience for rersia (e.g. anti-smuggling measures). It is therefore worth considering whether comprehensive statement should not be pre pared showing in detail settlement which Iraqi Government are prepared to offer on all these points (including a recapitula tion of Shatt-el-Arab Convention offer;, and whether before direct discussions are finally broken off, this statement should not also be communicated to Persian Government with object of eventually proving to rapporteur and Council that as Persian Government have rejected it responsibility for failure of direct discussions clearly lies at their door. 4 0 Rapporteur is still Italian representative, and if I.t&amp;ly was unrepresented at a Council meeting at which Perso-Iraqi fron tier question came up for consideration, President ot some other member of the Council would probably be invited to act in his place ad interim . 5. exception referred to in second paragraph is ^weakness of language used about British signature of any Shatt-el-Arab Con vention. This is unsatisfactory not only from point of view of His majesty's Government, but also from that of Iraqi Government, for if they in fact intend (as I assume they still do) to make full...o • •3. full British, participation a sin e qua non they may lay them selves ooen to a charge of having changed their ground ii they have to explain this later- ^ou need not necessarily raxse this point now, but when time comes you should make it clear that whatever views the Persian Government may express his majesty's Government expect the Iraqi Government to agree to no arrangement which excludes full Bricisn participation* 6 .

I got interview with Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday mainly with the object of eliciting his reactions to Iraqi note but he had not yet received it and seemed unfamiliar with the proposals it would contain. 2. Interview was very unsatisfactory. Minister for foreign Affairs said His Majesty's Ambassador had told Iranians and Turks at Bagdad that His Majesty’s Government were disinteresting themselves from the Shatt-el-Arab negotiations. I said Mr. Bateman had heard this story and had already told the rersian Minister that it uas a complete misunderstanding. I restated our position. 3. Minister for Foreign Affairs then (questioned our right to participate in control of the vhatt—el—Arab and tne force ol our argument derived from ownership of 90 per cent of the shipping, practically all ox which went to Abadan only. I questioned the Iranian right and said that His Mxcellency must know that unioj. tunately His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could no u leave con servancy in the sole hands of such unsuccessful co-operators, as the Iranians and Iraqis. I presumed his questions were academic in view of the Iranian Government's repeatedly stated readiness to agree to our full participation if Iraqi Government took the initiative by asking them to agree to it. j7 • • o • #4. Minister for Foreign Mffairs then said, this readiness had been conditional on His Majesty’s G-overnment s helping to secure bhatt—el—Arab settlement before tne end of last nai^n T said I remembered the paper to v/hich he was no douot refining (gentleman’s agreement of September 26th by Kazemi, before His Majesty’s Minister) but that only condition ever made by Iranian Ministers vas the one I had mentioned,, Minister for Foreign Affairs said his dossier showed otherwise. Later he alluaed to point 4 of his original instructions in Bagdad limiting control of the Shaft-el-Arab to the two riverain states and seemed to regard this instruction as now holdings 5. His Hxcellency treated me to a homily on the readiness shown by Turkey and by Russia since 1921 to wipe out unfortunate histories by frankly recognizing Iran's rights and position and relations with Russia were now calm, trusting and even iriendly. Unofficially Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted that steps in the same direction had always been a grudging success.

This would leave on Iraqis Burden of shoving that proposal with Persian modifications was inacceptable, 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs however said nothing to suggest that he now wanted our help end was more concerned to 'wriggle out of the undertakings to wnich is might commit them. Neither he nor Under Secretary of State seemed to expect much from Iraqi notes and Both talked of taking matter Back to Geneva, a course whicn Under Secretary of State has long advocaced.

He asked me to make an extort uo settle the question. The Persian Government only wanted two little things - half the river at Abadan and a commission to control and maintain the bhatt. I thought it time to give him some advice and- I told him that, speaning mjsel_, x ch. g’ that his government was making a mistake in asking xOx ;n._f .he water when the Iraqis were persuaded that for physical and practical reasons a quarter was the most they could cede. A quarter should give the Persian Government all they really needed. He said that he thought that he would have to recommend this to Tehran. He then turned to the administration of the bhatt, and declared himself in favour of a tripartite hoard. He added that, as Iraq owned most of the bhatt, it was for her to move to hnng about our inclusion in the hoard. When she did so his government would welcome the proposal. As to administration, after urging the British plan as the best solution, I said that I understood that the Iraqis did not think it fair for the Persians to claim a share in the maintenance of the Shatt and to exclude the Karun and the Bahmanshir from the hoard’s authority. He said that he had told lasrat that once a common control2 ^ 2 . of the Lshatt had been established the Persians vrould be willing to t he ixito Consideration any technical advice about the maintenance of their waters which the hoard gave* I said that personally I thought this too vague and after some on soussion he said that, in the last resort, his government might include in the agreement a clause to the effect that if the Board decided that it was necessary in the interests of the navigation of the bhatt to dredge or otherwise to undertake the maintenance of the waters of either country adjacent to the ahatt it should notiiy bne government concerned which would accept and consent to me putting into effect of the advice of the board. But he maue it clear that his government would never consent to the mention oi cne names of the two Persian rivers. On June 15th I discussed the question with huri. He said that ne could not feel that any progress had been made while he had been c '~ v/c ^° 1116 saiIle 1 miliar points were still outstanding.

Mr.Ndmonds foresaw that Persian Government might object to this. I have suggested to MacDougall that reply to Iranian note should say that Iraqi Government cannot consider protest against Iraqi quarantine arrangements until Persian Government explain exact meaning of reference to Iranian sovereignty over and rights in Shatt-el-Arab. Reply should also hint that failing a satisfactory explana tion Iranian note may not be considered receivable. It should also observe that presumption of sovereignty over any paru of Shatt-e1-Arab other than anchorage at Mohammerah is not only inadmissible but itself constitutes a departure from status quo of 1955.

He had previously told me that he was without recent news, and wanted to have the latest information. £» Just before Kuri Pasha arrived, I had received my white copy of Bagdad telegram No. 1&amp;6. I therefore read Hnri pasha the whole telegram, omitting paragraphs 10 and 11, and explained any points in it which he did not clearly understand. 3. Nuri Pasha expressed himself as very pleased with the attitude which Yassin had taken up, and seemed to think that satisfactory progress was being made. 4. I replied to this that, while His Majesty* s lover rime nt would of course welcome a direct frontier settlement, and did not wish their proposal for a tripartita Conservancy Board Convention to stand in the way of such a settlement, I was convinced that no settlement would be satisfactory in the long run which did not provide for the proper unified physical control of the whole waterway system under a single authority. I told Hurl Pasha that I had explained our views on this point to the Persian Minister in London on May 30th (see record In E 3145), and that I was undar the impress!&gt;n that the situation had not even yet been clearly understood in Tehran. I thought therefor® that the Iraqis would be wise to continue their efforts to secure a tripartite Conservancy Board with adequate powers of physical control over the whole waterway, including the Karun and the Bahmanshir. 5. If/5* If however the Persians persisted in their refusal to agree to the Iraqis having any direst voice in the control of the Karon and the Bahmanshir, It might possibly he worth considering some solution by which there should be an international tripartite hoard for the control of navigation* and local national hoards for the control of the various national waters, which should work in close contact and co-operation with each other* If the activities of these boards war© co-ordinated, and some arrangement were devised by which they aoted on the advice of the navigation board, it was possible that some compromise might perhaps be found* 6* Hurl Pasha obviously saw no hop© of the Persians agreeing to give the Iraqis a voice in the control of the Karun and the Bahmanshir, out he did not commit himself about any alternative, and the discussion was not further pursued* He proposes however to call on me again on the afternoon of Tuesday, June 9th, when it may be possible to pursue the matter further. { Sgd.)

Substance of your telegram has been communicated to Nuri Pasha who seemed pleased at Prime Minister’s attitude. He was again told that, while His Majesty’s Government did not wish proposals for tripartite Conservancy Board Convention to stand in way of otherwise satisfactory frontier settlement, they were convinced that no settlement would in long run prove satisfactory which did not provide for unified physical control of whole water way, including Kanin and Bahmanshir, under a single authority. They therefore considered that Iraqi Government should in true interests of themselves and everybody else continue to strive for auch a settlement, but nevertheless agreed that, if Persian Government persisted in refusing to place Karon and Bahmanshir under proposed Board, it might be necessary as a second best to consider some solution by which there should be an international (tripartite) -Board for the control of navigation and national Boards for the conservancy of the respective national waters, it being understood that the national Boards should work: in close contact and co-operation with each other and if possible on the advice of the tripartite navigation board. 5. You may use similar language to Prime minister. . 4. It must however he realised that the solution indicated m paragraph 2 would involve serious financial and administrative difficulties - for example, main income from dues is drawn_irom Abadan, whereas larger proportion of expenditure would ia.il on Board controlling conservancy of Iraqi waters.

I then gave M.

Nasrat and Persian .inister had been going over old ground. They had once more agreed about the land frontier but still disagreed regarding the width of anchorage at Abadan. 3. They had however set aside this point for a time and had gone on to discuss navigation and administration and maintenance of Ghatt-el-Arab. Nasrat had asked the Persian Minister what Article 3 of bamii’s draft had implied but found him unable to give clear answer. The Persian minister stated however that his govern ment would not object to British participation in any organiza tion set up to deal with these matters. 3. The Prime Minister said that he now proposed himself to meet the Persian Minister but before doing so he wished to con sult me. 6. would nis Majesty’s Government press for adoption of their own Conservancy Board proposals^ ./hat would they think of a Board of limited control of navigation only or possibly naviga tion and sanitation?

I re plie d that H/i r Majesty’s.,2, Majesty’s Government regarded their drafo convenoion as the best solution and they strongly advised both rersian and Iraqi Governments to accept this draft as a basis for dis cussion. On the other hand i knew uiab olie rrinie Minister himself [? inclined; towards a Board with powers to control navigation only in order to keep dredging in one hands of Iraqi Government. 8. I said that His Majesty’s Government would not wish to stand in the way of a settlement of this kind if rersians and Iraqis thought it better suited co their needs and they would welcome an invitation to take part in negotiations and signature of necessary Convention. I was sure however that His Majesty’s Government would not approve of a suggestion that they should be represented on the Board but not be sig natories to an instrument creating it. 9. The Prime minister then referred to Kanin and Bahmanshirc He said that it seemed most unlikely thau i.ersiano would agree to any Persian water whatever being placed under common control and suggested that this would make it difficult for Iraqi Government to adopt Conservancy proposals embodied in our draft Convention. He implied that uhis was a further reason for having navigation Board only. 10. In further discussion I based my remarks on your tele gram No. 5 of January 10th last. 11.

(E 2944/10/34) PERSO-IRAQI RELATIONS: TURKISH INTEREST* In the course of a conversation yesterday morning, M. human, the Turkish Permanent Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, asked me what the position was regarding Perso-Iraqi relations. 2. I thought it host to give him a frank statement of the position. I therefore gave him a short account of what had passed, 'beginning with the 1932 proposals, which had 'been provisionally accepted hy the Shah and Teymourtache, Kazemi’s subsequent repudiation of them, the better prospects for a settlement in 1934, and the most unfortunate results of the Persian attempt to jump a claim by setting up police posts on the Iraqi side of the 1913 frontier in the autumn of 1934, I explained that the Persian defence - i.e. that the frontier was not legally valid, and did not therefore exist and that no violation had taken place and had forced the Iraqis to take up the juridical issue; that the Persians had greatly injured their position by refusing to face this juridical issue, and by the subsequent confusion that had arisen as a result of the activities of the Italian rapporteur. 3. I then explained our position, which was that we wanted to see peace and friendship established between the two countries, and that our only direct interest in the matter arose out of the fact that 90% of the shipping using the Shatt was British, so that wewe were anxious that a stable and satisfactory situation should he established on the Shatt, and the proper conservancy and technical management cf the waterway assured. We had therefore proposed, after working out the technical aspects cf the matter with great care, and for the consideration of both sides, a tripartite conservancy convention which would get over the physical difficulties of the situation. The Irakis had more or less accepted this idea, and the Persians had not rejected it. But the Persians were refusing to agree to allow the Iraqis any voice in the control of the Persian waters which flowed into the Shatt-el-Arab, and were causing much of the present physical difficulty, i.e. the Karun, so that the Iraqis were very naturally arguing that they saw no reason why in that case they should give the Persians a voice in the control of the Iraqi water of the Shatt. As regards the anchorage at Abadan, it was obviously reasonable that the Persians should have something, but there had been a great deal of complicated bargaining about its extent which it had been rather difficult to follow. 4. We still thought that the proper solution of the whole problem was a tripartite conservancy board which would unify the physical and technical control of the whole of the Shatt waterway system. But our main anxiety was to see friendly relations established between Persia and Iraq, and we had therefore made it clear that we did not wish to stand in the way of a frontier settlement if the two sides could reach one without our assistance, and we would not press our suggestions for a conservancy board to the extent of makingmaking a direct settlement of the frontier problem more difficult. 5. M. Human, who I think was really familiar with the main facts, appeared to appreciate the situation, and seemed to understand our position. 6. I understand that he may be seeing Huri Pasha who is in London for a few ? days, before he leaves this country. (Signed) G.W. Rendel.

I saw the Prime Minister yesterday and asked him whether Abadan.^adsiic They had carefully studied the whole question and had decided that a quarter was the maximum offer they could make. As regards control* he was convinced that no commission or any sort of body charged with this duty could work smoothly if composed only of an. Iraqi and an Iranian representative. If deadlock was to be avoided, there would have to be a third member. Clearly His Majesty’s Government had the strongest right to fill this place, Iraq and Great Britain were allies and, for his part, he was not afraid to have a representative of His Majesty’s Government on any board that might be set up in the Shatt. Yassin said that he had added that the Iraqi Government had given His Majesty's Government pledges to this effect from which they would not withdraw. He had, at the same time, explained that I had made it clear to him that His Majesty’s Government did not wish their suggestion for a tripartite board to stand in the way of any alternative settlement of the frontier dispute (including the Shatt) which Iraq and Iran might be able to work out by direct negotiations, Mudhdhafar had then made no further effort to press for a bipartite control. Yassin had gone on to say that if Iran would accept the water front offered by the Iraqi Government and would confirm the rights of Iraq to control conservancy and navigation, nothing more would be needed. On the other hand, if the Iranians wanted a share in the control of the Shatt, they must state more plainly what sort of a joint commission they had in mind. They had copies of all the-existing regulations concerning the services in the Shatt. That did they want- altered? The Iraqi Government/L 5. G-ovenunent were quite willing to consider most sympathetically any representations which the Government ol Iran might care to make. Mudhdhsfar had then suggested that the penultimate BriMsh Conservancy Board Convention, (which did not place the Kami and the Bahmanshir under the control of the board), might be taken as a general guide for the drafting of the statutes of the commission. The Karun and the Bahmanshir must, he had said, remain under undivided Iranian control, but the Iranian authorities would always be ready to consult the bhatt authorities on all matters of common interest. Yassin had replied that of the two he preferred the iinal British drait. Yassin went on to say that, at the end o± his last talk with Mudhdhafar he had suggested that perhaps, after all, it w r ould be best if he and Furi were to go once more to lehr an and try to explain their views to the ohah. i' , .udhdhaxar haa, however, hastened to dissuade him from any idea of an early visit to Tehran and had said that he himself would report in detail and ask for further instructions.

Yassin laughed and said that he hoped that I knew him well enough to realise where the truth lay. I too have had a talk with Mudhdhafar who covered with me much of/-rT^Vr K” of the same ground as with Yassin, except that he made no mention of a bipartite board and affected deco belief in our penultimate draft convention* he said that success 01 the negotiations depended upon our helm, which I assured him that we were at all times ready to give, I asked if he had come with any special powers to negotiate and ne confessed that he would have to refer everything to Tehran, he told me, incidentally, that he had been a member of the 1914 - la frontier commission and that he therefore understood the qaescion thoroughly.

Another phase of bewildering and apparently interminable negotiations between Persia and Iraq has reached its close with the withdrawal of the Persian Delegation from Bagdad. Nothing whatever has been accomplished since the papers were last submitted at P.Z.8672/35 on the separate file attached. No question has arisen of sending a Britiah expert to participate in^negotiations as it has proved quite impossible to get down to a detailed examination of the Conservancy Board draft submitted the main lines of which are explained in the note at P.Z.1619/36. The Iraq Government are still reluctant to give the Persian Government a share in the 3330 1000 1 2.34 administration/n, mm administration of the river and s till toy with the idea that the functions of the Board should be limited to control of navigation, whilst the only definite contribution of the Persian Government has been their refusal to include the waters of the Karuk and the Bjlhman Shir within the control of/the Board. A deadlock has also been reached in the frontier question over the width and extent of the Abadan anchorage. In the meantime there are indications that the Persians may revert to the development of the port of Bandar Shahpur to which they wiSrl build a pipeline from Abadan, and there is also the possibility of their laying a claim to sovereignty over the Rookha Channel. Whether these are serious projects or merely a pistol held at the head of the Iraq Government only time can show.

(I was of course well aware of the practical certainty that all that would happen would be that the Iraqi and Persian representatives would inform the Council that the matter was still under direct discussion between the two Governments, but I felt it would be useful to obtain a confirmation of this from Nuri Pasha, and that incidentally this question would afford a useful opening to sound Nuri Pasha on the whole matter.) Nuri Pasha, as I expected, said that there was no question of referring the matter back to the Council, and that all that would be necessary at Geneva would be to inform the Council that it was still under discussion. He was only awaiting the formal concurrence of the Persian Government before addressing a communication to the League to this effect. 3. He then gave me an extremely confusing account of all that had taken place. His English was particularly/particularly halting and obscure, and in spite of the most careful attention, I found it most difficult to follow his narrative. The substance of it appeared however to be briefly as follows. A deadlock having apparently been reached in the negotiations in Bagdad, the Persians had invoked Turkish assistance, and as a result of representations from Angora, negotiations had been prolonged. In spite of this, no solution was yet in sight. The Persians were, according to Nuri, by no means keen on the Conservancy Board proposals which they had in any case virtually torpedoed by their insistence on the exclusion of all Persian water, and particularly of the waters of the Karun and the Bahmanshir from the control of the proposed Board. They were pressing for a mid-stream frontier opposite Abadan, and seemed to be under the impression that this would be the same as a thalweg frontier, though it was of course quite different. Actually, the thalweg was what they apparently meant. Nuri Pasha was himself inclined to doubt whether it was any use proceeding further with the Conservancy Board proposals if the Karun and the Bahmanshir were to be excluded. I understood him to say that he had offered the Persians various alternatives - (a) the Conservancy Board Convention as drafted by us, plus a frontier a quarter of the way across the river opposite Abadan (I may however have misunderstood him on the latter point), (b) a Convention to deal with navigation only and not with conservancy, plus a very narrow anchorage off Abadan, (c) a wider anchorage at Abadan on condition that all navigational control, etc • t /... ■ • ’ •- , etc., remained as at present in the hands of the Basra Port authority. I am not sure that I have got these proposals quite right, as Nuri Pasha was extremely confused and confusing about them, but the point is not of very great importance, as I gather that none of them were accepted, and they may all be regarded as having more or less lapsed. 4. I then suggested to Nuri Pasha that the Iraqis might be making a serious mistake in letting the Conservancy Board Convention go. The Convention would be of greater value to the Iraqis than to the Persians, as it would be a guarantee against the execution of any of the threats which the Persians were now reviving to develop the Bahmanshir to the exclusion of the Shatt-el-Arab, and generally to cause loss and injury to the main waterway. I thought myself - speaking quite personally - that it would be worth Iraq ! s while to make some sacrifice in order to secure the Convention, and that it might even be worth considering a v/ider cession of water for the Abadan anchorage if in return the Conservancy Convention 'could be secured. Nuri Pasha seemed to think, however, that it would be most difficult to secure the Convention owing to the Shah f s opposition to its having any control over Persian water, which would of course greatly increase the difficulty of giving the Persians any share in the control of Iraqi water. The impression I got was/ 2 .iswas that he was not very strongly opposed to the idea of a thalweg frontier opposite Abadan, but that he would be unlikely to make the acceptance of the Convention by Persia a condition of settlement. He persisted however in implying that it Y/as the Persians who were the chief opponents of the Convention for fear lest British participation in it should give an excuse for British intervention in the shatt, and generally in Persian affairs in this area. 5. Nuri Pasha ended by saying that the whole matter would have to remain in suspense for some time, and that there was little hope of making early progress. He had not made up his mind whether to visit Tehran, and was inclined to think that the time was not yet ripe for him to do so. 6. I thought it best not to press the matter further at this stage.

Minister for Foreign ,.ffairs confirmed that negotiations would he continued through diplomatic channel. The two chief difficulties had been Iraqi inability to agree to median line opposite Abadan and to equql rights proposed in Iranian draft - presumably enclosure 2 of Bagdad despatch 155. Monsieur Samii argued that though the desired anchorage would give Iran sovereignty over half the river there she would in effect relinquish this to the commission set up under a river convention so that unity of control and free passage of ships could not be interfered with. But Iraqi government would concede neither median line nor participatj^in the administration of the river. 2. If a convention did materialize Minister for Foreign affairs confirmed that his government would agree to our full participation but he must await Iraqi government's proposal. He wished His Majesty’s Government would help more. 5.

Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr* Bateman on Aprin 90tn that both Prime Minister and himself had had informal talk with the new Iranian Minister who has just arrived. Prime Minister told the Minister that the reason why no progress had been made in recent negotiations was that Iraqi Government had gained the ineluctable impression that i.ranian delegate had purposely kept in the background question of a mined administration in in order merely to extort as muon as possible from Iraq in the way of an anchor&amp;ge at Abadan, oo long as this impression remained there will be stalemate as Ir^qi Government intend to insist that any cession at Abadan must depend upon acceptance of nixed board by Persian Government.

Kazemi) to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. Bated Bahman 14th, 1314; February 4th, 1936. Unnumbered* My dear Charge d*Affaires, I have duly received the confidential letter of His Excellency Sir Hughe Kantchbull-Hugeasen No. 17/57/36 dated the 20th January 1936. I agree with the first part of the said letter; but in the second part there is a mistake, in tni* sense, that on Thursday the 16th January in conversation Hie Excellency the British Minister stated that on the subject of the com position of the 'basis of agreement' he saw eye to eye xfc with me and that'was in reality a ' Gentlemen* a Agreement' ; but that he was obliged to refer to his Government in order to initial it. And he uttered the first sentences of the second part on Sunday the 19th January after dinner at the British Legation, when I was there as hie guest; moreover I replied that the Imperial Government did not expect that the British Government would exhibit part isanship in favour of Iran as against Iraq; on the con trary , in view of the relations which you have with Iraq, we trusted that you would accelerate the settlement of a matter which it is in both sides’ interests to settle, and that you would help both sides. In the fourth part of the above-mentioned letter, in which the writer repeated the previous engage ments of the British Government, sentences were written which I interpret as bearing the following meaning: /thatthat in a limited period of time the negotiation of the whole of the necessary treaties and agreements will be, in practice, difficult. In this connexion 1 wish to explain that the mention of nine treaties and agreements in the fourth part of the 'basis of agreement' was made in order to specify what treaties and agreements were necessary for the two parties. And if it is thought that the negotiation of all these treaties and agreements would be impossible In a limited time, which was Moreover mentioned by way of illustration in the 'basis of agreement', I am ready to alter that in this way: that the two or three treaties which are of the greatest urgency and are to be regarded as the basis of agreement should be • negotiated in a certain reasonable limited period, while the discussion and the negotiation of the rest should be postponed to a subsequent time in the near future; and with regard to the fact that allusion is made in several places to the fact that since the British Government does not participate in these treaties and agreements it does not desire to incu/T any responsibility in their execution, I must explain that the existing relations and connexions between Britain and Iraq will result in this, that the British Government will be interested in these matters and will give necessary assistance in the solution of these questions. I have communicated to His Excellency the Iraq Minister in Tehran the desire of the Imperial Govern ment for a speedy negotiation of these treaties and for a settlement of these questions; and of course I shall be grateful if the British Government will also afford the Iraq Government the necessary encouragement, exhortation and guidance. It is obvious that the Imperial Government /will- 3 - will appreciate any help which the British Government and its honourahle representatives can give in the direction of the realisation of the Iranian Government’s righteous objecta, which are also entirely consonant with the interests of the Iraq Government.

INDIA OFFICE COPY SENT TO. iaswarBiBfeCOPY E 1601/10/34) (3/78/36). British Embassy, Bagdad. 10th March, 1936. My dear George, My letter (3/70/36) of the 25th February. The talks with the Persians go on fitfully, but progress, if any, has been too meagre to justify a despatch. I send you three things: (1) A copy of a report from Ward to the Prime Minister recording a conversation with Bayandor when the two of them, as experts, examined the Shatt water round about Abadan. (2) A copy of a record of this conversation signed by Ward and Bayandor, with a copy of a letter addressed by Ward to Bayandor some days later. (3) A copy of a letter from Ward to me, with two enclosures. I need not comment upon (1). (2), which Ward brought from Basra to deliver to the Prime Minister, made Yassin blow up. It seems that he had hoped that Ward and Bayandor would pronounce themselves upon both the length and the width of the piece of water to be ceded at Abadan and that he was greatly disappointed with the scanty result of their talk. Then he did not like the concluding words - ^between the boundaries of the respective countries” Hence the explanatory letter from Ward to Bayandor. Ward described his interview with the prime Minister to me as ”a rough passage” and Yassin as ”a little quarrel with Colonel Ward”. But they were soon fast friends again and in a private/ G.W.Rendel Esq., C.M.G.private letter to Ward Yassin thanked him for fulfilling his ^expectations” in conducting ’’such a delicate and r ather ’’difficult mission”, and Ward went hack to Basra. A few days ago he was called up to Bagdad again and asked to prepare a list of questions to he put to the Iranians about what they proposed to do with the Abadan water if it were ceded to them (see the first enclosure in (3)). And he was allowed to attend a meeting of the Iraqis and Persians, hut not to speak, which must have been painful to him. He does not know what passed at the meeting, which was conducted in French and Arabic, neither of which languages he understands. Meanwhile the Prime Minister sent him to me to ask what were the minimum requirements of His Majesty’s Government about the Shatt. I told him that they insisted upon the free passage of their warships (and I added merchant ships) i.e. ’’the ships of Iraq and her Allies” in all circumstances of peace and war, and that they would like to see the establishment of a unified control (see your telegram Ho.15 Saving of December 83rd, 1955). Then, at Yassin’s request, he prepared a note (see second enclosure in (3)) of what the Iraqi Government would have to lay down if the anchorage were ceded, Yassin gave me an account of wdiat passed at the meeting. He said that the question of both the length and the width of the anchorage had been discussed and that he had told Samii that the most that Iraq could give would be in width fifty yards from the pier heads out into the stream, starting from Ho 1 Jetty and going on to the northern point of the island below Bawarda, with a bulge near the point marked on sheet 3 of Chart ’’Shatt al Arab Kabda Point to Abadan” as ’’anchorage area”. This bulge would be about a cable broad and a mile long. Yassin thought that this would give the Persians/Persians a length of about six miles, hut Holt and I have looked at the chart and we find that it would probably be a bit more. Yassin said that Samii, although still clinging to the median line, seemed to be becoming less obstinate. He hoped that Samii would soon be going to Tehran to report progress to the Shah. This all seems to shew that Yassin is still out for a frontier settlement before tackling the question of a conservancy board. Many thanks for your letter (E 892/10/34) of the * 27th February, which has just reached me. I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosures to Nevile Butler at Tehran. Yours ever, (Intld.) A.G.K.ENCLOSURE No. Report by Colonel Ward to the Iraqi Prime Minister of discussions with Colonel Rayandor regarding the _ proposed Abadan anchorage. As instructed I proceeded on Monday February 17th down river in the Survey Vessel 'INDUSTRY' to pick up Colonel Bayendor the Iranian Senior Naval Officer off the entrance to the Xarun River taking with me the attached large scale charts of Abadan, On the way down I received a Wireless Message from Colonel Bayendor inviting me to his house to lunch. Thinking it would enable me to better carry out your instructions if we were afloat and in the Abadan Reach, I replied that I hoped he would lunch with me on board the 'INDUSTRY'. At 11 a.m. he boarded the 'INDUSTRY' and as we had met several times before we naturally drifted into conversation concerning the navigation of the Shatt-al-Arab. It was during this conversation that I covered all the ground. It was perhaps fortunate that the week previous to our meeting there had been bad weather and a rather dreadful sand storm. There wras also a large German Merchant Vessel discharging cargo off Mohamraerah (now called Khorramshahr) which enabled me to graphically describe the difficulties of Navigation and the danger of dual control of shipping. I pointed out that a ship of that size fully laden would draw r over 30 feet in fresh water and he could well imagine what would happen if a vessel of that size, coming down from Basrah last week in a heavy sand storm with a strong shamal N.W. Y/ind and swift ebb tide running, suddenly appeared round the bend at the top of Abadan Reach in which a ship full of oil Y/as manoeuvring, and in which, I pointed out, only about half the river was available for ships drav/ing 30 feet or over ov/ing to the growing shallow Iraq foreshore. At that moment we were approaching the bend and I was able to illustrate the narrownessof it and the dangers of navigation if there were two Authorities controlling shipping in the River. I rather sensed that he was out to ohuain not only half the river hut the entire control of the Harbour of Abadan. He agreed that there could only be one control in order that movements of vessels coming down from Basrah or Khorramshahr and also those entering from the sea could be directed, and controlled by one Authority. Incidentally, I pointed out how important it w r as for Iraq to retain full ownership of the river for that and other reasons. Irap had. only one Port and that was over 30 miles above Abadan, The Shatt-al-Arab was a main artery and I imagined they could not possibly give any of it away. 'How would you feel if the position was reversed' I asked and emphasised that Abadan Reach was not the same as Mohammerah Reach. The former was at the top of a bad bend,' was already restricted and Abadan was a Port from which dangerous oil was shipped. Situated as it was below the Karun the reach required conserving and the dredger 'LIGER'» which I had working there much the same as you saw her working at Margil v/hen you came down, afforded an opportunity to put to Colonel Bayendor a few more leading questions. I said 'Where would we put the mud that she is picking up if that part of the river was Iran’s, and where would you put the Tanker if she caught on fire'? The result was that he did not suggest that any portion of the River should be ceded to Iran, in fact he raised no question of that nature which your instructions led me to expect, but he did ask what were the limits of Abadan Harbour and I told him that they were already defined in the Book of port Rules and Regulations a copy of which he had but he asked what I considered should be the limits of the Abadan Harbour and after studying the chart I said from No.1 Jetty to the upstream end of Shutait Island. In our regulations we speak of Slow Notice Boards which are erected on the Iraq bank. When passing through Abadan Reach he appreciated that no ships could be allowed/allowed to anchor in the Area abreast of the jetties. He also agreed that a floating dry dock in that area was dangerous as also were the native craft that anchored off the Village between Abadan Bawarda. When passing up through the deep bend above Abadan I pointed out the erosion of the Iraq bank caused by the bunding on the Muhalla Island foreshore and said if we did the same thing in the Iraq foreshore at Seeba it would cause the Iran shore at Abadan to erode and suggested that they should stop it and he said he had already suggested that it should be stopped. We then had lunch whilst Mr. Nicoll, (whom I had taken with me to explain in Persian anything which my English made difficult for him to understand) drew up our brief Joint Report which we both signed during our conversation. You will appreciate that the question of Iraq giving up or ceding a portion of the river was not mentioned, but only the limits of Abadan Anchorage and the Control of the Movement of shipping from the Boundary Pillars to the sea. It was clearly recognised by Col. Bayendor that there could only be one definite Authority to control the Navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab. Naturally, as the question of giving up a portion of the river was not raised, it was not for me to even suggest it. (Sgd. ) J. C. Ward. Colonel P. E. Pebry. 25. 1956.V ENCLOSUI^E NO. 2.

My dear Sir Archibald, Reference our conversation of yesterday in regard to the Boundary discussions. I forward, as promised, the notes which I was asked to prepare. The first was prepared in your office after the talk which I had with you at Yasin Pasha's request and you gave me a note which I passed on to Masrat Beg the President of the Boundary Commission. Yasin wanted to know from the Iran delegates what they proposed to do with the strip of water if such was ceded to them. As verbally explained, at the discussion at the afternoon meeting of the delegates, the Iranian Minister said that he must refer the matter to his Government and suggested that, in the meantime, he should be informed at the next meeting what restric tions Iraq was likely to impose. After the meeting we departed and Nasrat Beg reported the result to the P. M. and then telephoned me to come and see him. He told me that the P.M. was very satisfied and wished me to prepare a note on Navigation and Conservancy. He explained that he had divided the subject under three heads:- (1) ADMINISTRATION, which included Customs, Police, and Sanitation which he would deal with. (2) NAVIGATION ) (3) ) on which he asked me to prepare a note CONSERVANCY ) and to come and discuss this side of the problem at his house at 4 p.m. the next day. At/At the appointed hour we met and discussed the enclosed note at length and the strip of water upon which discussion might eventually take place. He was very satisfied with the notes and said that he would put them up in a more legal form. He said that I would not he required again until the next meeting of the Commission was fixed. I think I have covered everything in the note. If not perhaps you will let me know and I may have an opportunity lat er to fit it in. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. C. WARD.

J4y dear Minister, T did not fall to telegraph to ay Government and to H1 b Majesty’s Ambaesador in Baghdad, as requested by Your Excellency, the contents of your letter of the 4th February (14th Rahman) on the subject of the negotiation of certain questions outstanding between the Iranian and Iraqi Governments. In that letter Your Excellency stated that the imperial Government would appreciate any assistance that my Government could give In persuading the Iraqi Government to negotiate within a reasonable limited period the more important and urgent questions which could be regarded as the basis of a general settlement; and that the negotiation of the other outstanding questions could be postponed to the near future. Your Excellency mentioned to me the meeting of the uouncil of the League of Nations in May as the dote before which the more urgent agreements should be concluded. In this category you placed the Frontier dispute between the tv.o countries. 2. I have now ascertained the views of my Government and am able to reply to Your Excellency as follows; 3. His Majesty’s Government fully share Your Excellency’s view that the curtailing of the number of subjects to be negotiated in the first instance is likely to facilitate an early settlement, and they have every sympathy .s Excellency Monsieur B. Kazemi, Minister for Foreign Affairssympathy with the Imperial Government’s desire for this. They are indeed convinced that the hest plan would he to take first the frontier dispute including the Shatt-el-Arah. They believe that when this is settled other questions will he solved more readily. They are convinced too that what is now most necessary is detailed work between the Iranian and lra&lt;ii Delegatee on definite and practical proposals in a spirit of give and take. Kis Majesty’s Government have made their contribution in the form of the draft Convention, drawn up after prolonged expex*t study. But although they still regard the conclusion of a tripartite Convention as in the interests of all parties concerned and as essential sooner or later, they will nevertheless welcome a satisfactory settlement of the frontier question even in advance of, and independently of, the conclusion of any agreement regarding the conservancy and navigation of the Bhatt~el~Arab. They will in any case continue to give their good offices, diplomatic and expert, in connexion with any considered proposal put before them. 4. His Majesty’s Government will be very glad to see the settlement of other questions of interest to Tran and Iraq. It is, in their opinion, for the Iranian Government to decide for how much to aim and in how short a time. The suggestion in the preceding paragraph is made in knowledge of the formidable work that s businesslike settlement of the Shatt will involve, and not at all to the exclusion of the Iraqi and Iranian Governments being able to settle other questions also before the Council meets in May.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 36, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of the brief summary of the draft of the Shatt-el-Arab Convention, a Persian translation of which I handed to the Shah during the course of my audience with His Majesty on the 18th January. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, No. 5. I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure. Brief Summary of the Draft of the Shatt-el-Arab Convention. THE draft convention has two main objects : (a) to provide for the ■conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, that is, its maintenance as a navigable waterway adequate to the needs of the shipping of all nations; (b) to control the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, that is, to provide all shipping using the waterway with a uniform system of control, administration and discipline in all matters necessary for safe and efficient navigation. 2. For this dual purpose the convention sets up a conservancy board. It consists of three members, two representing Iran and Iraq as the riparian Powers and the third Great Britain as the State owning over 90 per cent, of the shipping using the river. The seat of the board will be at Basra. 3. In order that the board shall be able properly to carry out the first part of its task, that is the maintenance of the Shatt-el-Arab as a navigable waterway, it is most important that all channels which may affect the navigability of the Shatt-el-Arab should be placed under the control of the board. The convention therefore provides that the board’s control shall extend over the whole of the Shatt-el-Arab, including its seaward approaches to a point above its junction with the Karun; the last 3 miles of the Karun and also the whole of the Bahmanshir, and 50 metres up all branch waterways of these main streams. The draft convention also places under the control of the board all the banks of the waters under its jurisdiction, and gives it authority to undertake, regulate or forbid the construction of any jetties, wharves, embankments, dams, &amp;c., connected in any way with the maintenance of the waterway. The board is given power to carry out dredging and all work of whatever kind necessary to maintain the navigability of the Shatt-el-Arab. 4. For the execution of the second part of its task, that is the control of navigation, the board is given power to draw up and to enforce all necessary navigation and administrative regulations. The convention provides that these regulations must ensure the equal treatment of all shipping using the river in all matters and especially in regard to dues. For the enforcement of its regulations, the board is given power to inflict penalties for oflences connected generally with navigation matters; but it is not made responsible for the maintenance of law and order or for the prevention of smuggling. The board is empowered to provide all lighting, buoying and pilotage services. In order that it shall be fully free to execute its task, the convention provides that it and its members and officials shall be independent of the territorial Governments [640 k—3]' in so far as their functions are concerned, and further that the board shall be free to make its own arrangements regarding the engagement and employment of its own officials and servants. ■ ^ * j 5. Finally, the convention empowers the board to raise the tunds necessary for the fulfilment of its task by levying dues on shipping using the waterway. The convention provides that all dues levied shall be moderate m amount, and shall correspond as far as possible to ser\ices Tendered, and further that they shall be levied equally and impartially in respect of all vessels.nil % any further communication on this subject, please quote No. Li ^ ' 7 ^ \4 i \o| 5^ , and address —not to any person by name, but toV The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. r 1 3 7 0 -■'i THE Undei-Secietary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to - '^suc*rtJCZ\^ ov &lt; SGoLT and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^-o of the under-mentioned paper* 40 Foreign Office, ^jlAjwv , 193 Reference to previous correspondence : &gt;' ^ -O . oAXw vlo , 5 Description of Enclosure.(E 5858/1131/93) No» 492 .

NO. 492 British Embassy, Bagdad. 12th September, 1935. My dear Prime Minister, During our conversation at the Embassy on September 2nd, Your Excellency expressed a desire to see the text of a paragraph which was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March last for incorporation in the speech by the Minister of Finance in presenting the budget for 1935. This text is as follows:- ,f In the matter of fixing the dredging dues to be levied on shipping passing though the Soo&amp;s channel, the Iraqi Government will be guided by international practice, subject to the condition that the amount thereby collected shall not be less than the necessary expenditure incurred for the maintenance and improvement of the channel and its approaches to a depth and breadth adequate for the bulk of the shipping making use of it.” Your Excellency is of course aware of the reasons why it is advisable - especially at the present time - to make it clear that the Iraqi Government intend to continue their policy of adjusting the dredging dues to the actual cost of maintaining and improving the channel and its approaches. This policy is in accordance with the international instruments to which Iraq is a party. Yours very sincerely, (Signed) C.H.Bateman. is Excellency Yasin Pasha al Hashimi, President of the Council of Minister, Bagdad.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT WITH reference to Mr. Bateman’s despatch No. 492 of the 12th September, I have the honour to report that, in the course of a speech which he made in the Chamber of Deputies on the 31st December last when introducing the budget estimates for 1935, the Prime Minister announced a reduction of 15 per cent, in the Fao Bar dredging dues. He stated that this reduction had been made in pursuance of the Government’s policy, adopted as from the 1st April, 1935, under which dredging dues to be levied from shipping passing through the Rooka Channel, in transit, should not be in excess of those admissible by international practice, subject to the condition that the amount thereby collected should not be less than the necessary expenditure incurred for the maintenance and improve ment of the channel and its approaches to a depth and breadth adequate for the bulk of the shipping making use of it. 2. The wording used by the Prime Minister differs slightly in two respects from that approved by the Council of Ministers last March :— (a) Instead of saying that the Iraqi Government would be “ guided by (b) The Prime Minister added the words ‘ ‘ in transit. ’ ’ In the first case, the wording used by the Prime Minister is an improvement from the point of view of British interests. In the second, the phrase added by the Prime Minister would not appear to affect the sense of the declaration. EASTERN (Iraq). February 3, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. a Section 1. E 579/481/93] (No. 39.)

My dear Minister, In the course of our conversation on January 16th regarding the negotiations hetween the Iranian and Iraqi Governments, Your Excellency informed me that the Iranian Government were now willing to accept the principle of a Tripartite Conservancy Convention to he negotiated and signed 'by Iran, Iraq and Great Britain, if they were definitely asked to do so hy the Iraqi Government. In r eturn Your Excellency asked for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in expediting the subsequent negotiations for a final settlement within a specified time of all questions outstanding between the Iranian and Iraqi Governments. In order to make the attitude of your Government perfectly clear Y~our Excellency was good enough to hand to me a statement containing the full particulars of your proposals. This statement bore the heading 'Base d’accord' and Your Excellency suggested that we should at once initial it* 2. Your Excellency will remember that. I then stated that His Majesty’s Government were entirely ready to do all that was possible to assist in expediting a conclusion of the negotiations, but that they could do nothing which appeared to commit them to assist. Your Excellency s 'government against that of Iraq or to bind them to one party against the/ Excellency tnsieur B. Kazemi, Minister for Foreign Affairs.the other - a point of view of which Your Excellency expressed full understanding. I also said that before replying to Your Excellency's suggestion that we should initial the 'Base d'accord” I felt that I must ask instructions from my Government. 3. since the date of our conversation I have studied the document closely and having now received the instructions of my Government I am in a position to reply to Your Excellency's proposal. 4. His Majesty’s Government have throughout made every effort to promote a satisfactory settlement of Irano- Iraqi difficulties and have placed their good offices at the service of both parties for this purpose. In so far as Iranian interests are concerned. His Majesty’s Government have acted in virtue of the undertaking given in Sir RX Clive's letter of March 11th, 1929, in the following terms:- 'Mon Gouvernement, ayant appris en detail du Gouvernement persan les diffieultes pratiques qui surgissent de 1'etat actuel des choses dans le ohatt-el-Arab, et les garanties qu'il desire, prStera ses bons offices vis-a-vis le Gouvernement irakien pour aider la Perse a obtenir ses demandes raisonnables.' This undertaking they will continue to carry out. They feel, however, that it is impossible for them to go beyond this or to assume any additional obligations. A further obstacle which they see is that in allowing me to initial the 'Base d*accord', His Majesty’s Government would be under taking a somewhat indefinite responsibility for ensuring the/the conclusion within a specified time limit of agreements on various matters which are not their direct concern and to which there is no question of their being parties. Nor is it possible for them to identify themselves with or assume any obligation with regard to the negotiations for the conclusion of a non-aggression pact of the nature referred to in point 2 of the Base d’accord, which equally is not a matter in which they are concerned. 5. For these reasons my Government feel that it is scarcely appropriate that I should initial the proposed ’’Base d’accord”. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government are most desirous of continuing to give every possible assistance in promoting the satisfactory solution of all these difficulties. They would therefore be prepared, if Your Excellency so desires, to communicate the desiderata of the Iranian Government to the Government of Iraq, including your desire f*or a speedy settlement.

My feeling is that it would now probably be best to leave Persian and Iraqi delegations in Bagdad to work together for a while in their own way* Prime Minister told me yesterday that negotiations were being made difficult by Persian insistence on (a) That 1914 frontier should be described anew from North to South [see Mr. Edmond’s narrative of events at Geneva, paragraph 31 (b)*]. (b) That proposed water front at Abadan should be twelve miles in length and in breadth to Median line® (c) That from point (mentioned in Minute of Second sitting of Delimitation Commission) two miles down stream from Sheikh Khazal’s fort to the * open sea frontier should follow Median line.

Y* I stated that oy impression was entirely different and timt I possessed no information whatever to show trial nis majesty's government had agreed to such procedure. on the contrary, I was certain that his ha^esty‘s Government considered that negotiations should ta&amp;e place on the basis of the Draft Tripartite Convention as recently revised, copies of which are in the possession of your delegates at Baghdad, b. evertheiess, in order to ascertain beyond all doubt exactly wrat the real position was X /informedInformed tnn secretary of state of your views as expressed to ^ 0 * 4, I have now received a reply wnicn states oati^-oricaXly that r oar xcellency *8 view th,@t or. den had agreed to any of these points is based on a very serious misunderstanding. Toe question whether the proposed Conservancy iprement should take the form of an annex to the Trano-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship was not discussed with ur* .den, tiiere was no sort of agreement of the subject nor did any discussion of a draft take -place. oreovei , His Majesty’s Government hold that there exists no reason why u tripartite instrument shoul.t not be annexed to a bilateral treaty* In addition 9 is ajesty f s Government nave from the outset ^aade it abundantly clear botn to the Iranian and to too Iraqi Governments that they attached the utmost Importance to being parties to the proposed Convention, c* X expect to receive further instructions on this matter and will ask Tour excellency to be good eoouga to receive me a© soon as 1 an in possession of them.

His Excellency hoped these could be concluded before May meeting of the Council of the League. He asked me to telegraph resume of his letter to London for you and His Majesty’s Minister and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. I promised and said that j • while His Majesty’s Government were very willing to help a general settlement (your telegram No. 27) they felt strongly that present block would best be broken by Persian and Iraqi representatives getting to work on concrete texts. Minister for Foreign Affairs said he was expecting a telegram from Persian Minister at Bagdad and would then tell me how the position there stood. 5o My comments Mill follow.

Minister for Foreign Affairs’ letter answers by *[grp t undec.]^ His Majesty’s Minister's reply of January 20th so the request quoted textually is presumably answer to offer in last sentence. But it is far from precise and His Excellency has already apparently communicated his government’s desiderata to Iraqi Minister here. Also his request is presumably inacceptable in view of objections in your telegram No. 17 and Bagdad telegram No. 16 which shows too that Iraqi and Persian Govern ments are at cross purposes. Kazemi wants several questions settled before May next including frontier dispute through inter alia a conservancy convention. Yasin Pasha objects to discussing anything else until frontier dispute is settled and he still jibs at a conservancy convention. 2. In these circumstances Shatt-el-Arab seems the key and in replying to Minister for Foreign Affairs there would perhaps be advantage in concentrating on that and in giving.Persian Government best adyice wq can. 5. Subject to views of His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad I would suggest reply on lines following. His Majesty's Government in United Kingdom agree that curtailing the number of subjects is likely to facilitate ear±y settlement with desire for which they have every sympathy. Indeed they are convinced best plan would be to take fl^st the frontier dispute including Shatt-el~Arab. They believe that when2. \ M add, 1 ' v/hen this is settled other questions will he solved more readily* They are convinced that what is now most necessary is detailed work between Persian and Iraqi delegates on definite and practical proposals in a spirit of give and take. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have made their contri bution in the form of draft convention drawn up after prolonged expert study. They will continue to give their good offices,, diplomatic and expert, in connexion with any well thought out proposal put before them, 4 P They will be very glad to see settlement of other questions of interest to Persia and Iraq and the earlier the better. It Is for Persian Government primarily to decide for how much to aim. and in how short a time. Suggestion in preceding paragraph is made in good faith, in the knowledge of the formidable work that a business like settlement of Sha11—el—’Arab will involve, and noi&gt; ... ^ t’** _i__- r, „+ ^ ^ -fr-N I Yasin Pasha, and 11 ne agrees oo a uun^x vax^ principle, and Karun difficulty by dredge or pledge can be over d ! accord and gentleman's agreement but 1 think that all references can be ignored in our reply* oome, a se oome, a settlement may follow. Persian Minister for foreign Afiaiis renewed request for our help will have been met by our best advice m procedure as well as technical assistance and we could legitimately claim credit. 6.

The Prime Minister discussed Shatt-^el^Arab convention with me yesterday morning. He asked me what was the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the proposed draft conservancy board convention. I replied in the sense of last paragraph of your telegram No. 5 stressing the fact that the draft was the outcome of prolonged study of the whole question by a large number of highly qualified experts. The Prime Minister said that he still felt the strongest reluctance to allow dredging in Iraqi waters to pass out ox. the sole control of the Iraqi Government and gave outline of his idea ox a Shatt-el-Arab board similar to that reported in my telegram No* 15. He added that Persian recognition of 1914 frontier in exchange for the cession of an anchorage at Abadan was the se btlerneiiu Anrhi lie mast favoured but he feared that Persians would not be satisfied without some share in control of Sha11~el-Arab affairs. j..o n.xo mind the less the better. j In view of your telegram No. 27 to Tehran I aid not attempt to enter into details (and I doubt if the Prime Minister had prepared any) but I again made it clear that His Majesty's Govern ment attached much importance to being a party co any ±orm oi Shatt-el-Arab convention which Iraqi and Persian Gcueromenta might, propose to conclude.

The differences, S'irZhirof a minh ehl-cter, have formed the subject of separate Majesty’s Government wo^ glad if th.late, te^t.uld be adopted without modification, but th \ rpp-arded as a basis for discussion .... ■ 8298 [12604]3. For this reason His Majesty’s Government think it well to indicate in the present memorandum the principles to which they attach especial importance in connexion with the establishment of a Conservancy Board. These principles may be enumerated as follows s— (1) British Participation in the Convention. His Majesty's Government regard it as essential that the convention shall be a tripartite agreement between Iraq, Persia and the United Kingdom, without the participation of any other Power, and that in all matters relating to signature, ratification, prolongation, revision or denunciation, the United Kingdom shall be on precisely the same footing as the other two signatories. It is desirable that the convention should remain in force for, if possible, not less that fifty years. His Majesty’s Government would not object, if the other parties so desired, to giving it unlimited validity. (2) British Participation in the Board. His Majesty’s Government also regard it as essential that the board to be set up under the convention shall consist of three members appointed by the Governments of Iraq, Persia and the United Kingdom respectively, without members appointed by any other country, and that the British member'shall have the same powers as the members appointed by the other two Governments. Each Government should have complete discretion as to the person whom it appoints to act as its representative on the board at any particular time, and safeguards should be included in the convention to prevent any Government holding up the work of the board by failing to appoint a member at all, or allowing him to absent himself from its meetings. (3) 7 he Conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. It is essential that the powers given to the board shall be such as to enable it enectively and efficiently to carry out its primary duty, i.e., the maintenance and control ot the bhatt-el-Arab as a navigable waterway adequate to the needs of the shipping normally desiring to make use of it. For this purpose- fa) The waters to be brought under its control must include the whole of the bhatt-el-Arab, including its seaward approaches, i.e., the dredged or dredgeable channels at and beyond its mouth, from the open sea to a point above the junction of the Shatt-el-Arab with the Karun; the last tey miles of the Karun, including some part of its course above the point at which the Bahmanshir branches off, as well as that part 0 i s couise known as the Haffar Canal; if possible, the whole, but in ofn T- v ! aS L the mile or so ’ of . the Bahmanshir; and the so- 1 • f e oat n Channel ; together with the necessary minimum is ance up a the subsidiary streams, inlets, creeks, &amp;c. dependent on these mam waterways; ^ e % c ^ V( f co . ntr °l over the banks of the waters under its jurisdiction and authority to undertake, to regulate or to forbid the Sr tl0 ^° f ^ j ettle D S ’ groins, dams, sluices, quays, wharves, mainfAri men S ’ reve j™ en ^&gt; connected in any way with the control, maintenance or safety of the waterway; C 1 wftt !T e ade q uate financial powers (subject to the safeguards dealt with m piiragraph (5) below); and 11 inpmhpl- t 5 ese m an( ? a ^ other powers and functions, it and its soverpi cmf° C1 ^ S , m y st ^ u lly independent of the territorial -i. Jr; i’ u m . ust a f the same time receive the co-operation of the rules and regulations. “ a matterS aS the enfOT cement of its (4) The Navigation of the Bhatt-el-Arab.

It is most desirable that sanitary control over shipping using the waterway and quarantine arrangements should also be included among these matters and fall within the exclusive and effective control of the proposed board. (5) Finance. Safeguards are desirable to ensure that the board shall not levy higher dues than are necessary tor the efficient performance of its duties, nor accumulate unnecessarily large reserves, nor invest these reserves in an improper manner. Furthermore, if any part of the debt now owing to His Majesty s Government from the Port of Basra is transferred to the board, the board must accept uncon ditional responsibility for the discharge of this part of the debt on the same terms as are now applicable to its discharge by the Port of Basra. (6) Jurisdiction The board should nave the power to inflict penalties for offences connected with navigation matters generally, but it should preferably not be saddled with the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, in the ordinary sense of the term, on the waterways under its control or in the shipping using those waterways, nor for the prevention of smuggling, nor for the rendering of judg ments in disputes between other parties, such as collisions, involving civil damages. In these cases, while free to punish a breach of its own regulations, its functions should be confined to those of investigation and the furnishing, if required, of expert evidence. It is desirable that provision should be made for cases in which the board is itself involved in a claim for civil damages, but this should be done by providing for arbitration and not by making the board justiciable in the Iraqi or Persian courts. The converse is not required, as there is no reason why the board should not be free to sue in the Iraqi or Persian or any other courts. If it is necessarv that for this or any purposes connected with Iraqi or Persian law the board should be formally declared to be a corporate person, there is no objection to the inclusion of an article to this effect. (7) Personnel. It is important that the board should be left complete freedom to make its own arrangements with regard to the engagement and employment of its officials and servants. His Majesty’s Government recognise that it may be necessary to admit a certain number of Persian subjects to employment under the ooard, but they hope that this will be achieved gradually and that the board will begin by taking over the existing staff of the Port of Basra administration. His Majesty s Government would, in any case, deprecate any attempt to prescribe the piopoi- tions in which persons of different nationalities were to be employed, and considei that the countries concerned can safely regard their representation on toe boa id as a sufficient guarantee that their interests in this respect will not be o^pookei 4. The above list does not profess to include every point to which His Majesty’s Government attach importance. But it would be a task ot great difficulty to set forth the principles and arguments underlying every article ot the convention as at present drafted, and any attempt to do so would be i ~e \ o cause confusion rather than clarity. In most cases the principles and aigumeii s m question will be familiar to the British negotiators, either trom their knowledge of the discussions which have gone to the preparation ot aie piesen \&lt;ii ex or from their experience of similar questions elsewhere. M here any doubt exists or arises regarding some particular article, paiagraph oi parage, specia instructions can always be sought if necessary by telegraph 5. It is desirable, however, to deal m this memorandum with one othei important point which may cause some difficulty. t seems Persian Government may wish to make all questions without exeepUon the subject of a unanimous vote, and that the Iraqi Goveinmen ; Persian Majesty’s Government will always be ranged upon their side againy the Persian Government may wish to make all questions without exception the subject ol a ma onty vote In the view of His Majesty’s Government, as expressed m the draft convention, the proper solution is provision for a f^^ority matters of outstanding importance, including financial conti o , and for a majonty vote in all ordinary matters. The present draft theiefoie repiesents acompromise between the two extreme views indicated above which will probably be held by the Persian arid Iraqi Governments respectively, and it is to be hoped that on this account it may prevail. But if His Majesty’s Government were forced to make a choice between these two views, they would regard majority voting as less dangerous than unanimous voting, which would give any one of the three members the power to render the work of the board entirely nugatory. They consequently regard it as important that the list of cases in which the draft convention provides for unanimous voting should not be extended to any great extent, though there is no objection to the consideration of individual suggestions on their merits. Suggestions for a reduction of the list may also be considered, although His Majesty’s Government would, for instance, be most reluctant to lose the veto which the draft convention now gives them in the matter of the raising and lowering of shipping dues. 6. His Majesty’s Government cannot indicate with greater precision the sort of text which they would be willing to accept in default of any more satis factory text, and they must leave it to their representatives, bearing these directions in mind, to do their best to secure a text resembling as much as possible the draft of December 1935. In so far as it may prove impossible to secure the acceptance of any particular article or passage of the convention in the form in which His Majesty’s Government have proposed it, or in a form which is clearly equally satisfactory, it will usually be better for any such article or passage to be omitted altogether, even though it embodies an important safeguard, than for the point with which it deals to be covered in ambiguous, misguided or unreasonably restrictive language. If the point is not mentioned at all, the board will at least be free to use its discretion, and at the worst the normal principles of equity can be invoked as a defence against any flagrant abuse of that discretion. But if the board is committed to unsound principles, the harm done may be irreparable. 7. The language or languages in which His Majesty’s Government would be glad to see the convention signed are in the following order :— (a) A sole English text. (b) Persian, Arabic and English texts, with English as the master-text. (c) English, Persian and Arabic, all texts being equally authentic; where they differ, any two which agree prevailing over the third. (d) A sole French text.

This establishment at the mouth of the Shatt has fteen greatly expanded during the last two years, and construction work continues. Colonel Ward hopes to make it the base and dockyard of all the Port vessels - tugs, dredgers and river craft - and is considering the purchase of a floating dock. At present, his three large dredgers must go to Bombay annually for docking and refit, and apart from the time wasted on passage, this arrangement costs about £40,000 per annum. A new vessel which can be used either for control or pilot vessel is also projected and some more dredgers. 39* Captain Garstin (R.I.N.Retd.) arrived at Basrah in December, and it is understood that a great deal of the work of the Port Directorate will be under his supervision, while Colonel ¥ard ! s activities are likely to be increased by taking over the direction of the Iraq, railways.[This Do cument is the Property o f His Britannic Majesty’s G overnment, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official usd.] A No* 44.

Vhen I asked him if the Persian Government had attached any other conditions to their proposals, he sdd no. The Prime Minister confirmed that Kazemi had told Khalid that the Persian Government would agree to British signature of the tripartite Shatt~el~Arab convention if Iraqi Government asked them to do so.

The Prime Minister I know now holds strong view that frontier dispute must be settled first and that until this is done no other matter of common interest to Persia and to Iraq can be discussed in an atmosphere of trust and confidence.

His Majesty said he was perfectly willing to coordinate management of Karun with that of bhatt- el-Arab and to follow the advice of the hoard hut Iranians must do the work and have control themselves* I observed that cur proposal regarding Karun and Bahman^hir was only the counterpart to what was being offered to Iran m the form of share of control in Shatt-el-Arab, His Majesty replied that they did not want corresponding share in Shaft-el-Arabo 2* Continuing conversation with Minister for foreign Affairs afterwards latter confirmed that Persian Government were willing to act on the advice of the hoard with regard to Karun (and I gathered Bahmanshir) hut could do no more.I remarked that their attitude was illogical as th^v were expecting concessions in Shatt-el-Arah and v.ou] 6 give nothing in return.

Xazemi’s objects in trying to get His Majesty's Government to take such an initiative and in making the ty&amp;V proposal outlined in your telegram No. 31 (of January 16th) are obscure but there seems no reason why we should lend ourselves to a manoeuvre so clearly intended to serve some ulterior motive, though there would of course be no objection to the Iraqis, if they wish to do so in response to Kazemi's direct request (see your telegram W v No, 32 (of January 16th)), formally repeating to Persian No. 17.

Attitude which His majesoy’s Government S 1 1^Tv- 3. C-over jTliiiQii t have consistently maintained since Sir H. Clive’s undertaking oi 1929 has always been that they would use their good oil ices with doth parties to oriiy.. about a generally satis!uctory settlement. This they have always done and are still doing. it is inrpossihlu for them to go further or to give any under- talcings regarding the conclusion of agree.-cents to which there is no question of their being parties, and with which they have no direct concern. Kasemi’s proposal is in fact quite inacceptabie and inappropriate. I entirely agree with objections to it given in your telegram No. 34 (of January 16th), but suggest that your reply, while following general lines you propose, should also take foregoing considerations into account, making it plain in addition that if Persian and Iraqi Govern ments can reach general agreement on frontier question without conclusion of proposed Conservancy Convention, His majesty’s Government will raise no objection, though they would consider that the two Governments were making a mistake. 6. On the other hand it is important to avoid giving Persian Government any excuse for representing His majesty’s Government as obstructing or even failing to further a settlement, and if you consider that this risk might be reduced by our offering to communicate to the Iraqi Government the Persian Government’s desiderata as summarized in your te 1 egram No.^ 31 (of January 161h) there would, subject to the views of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, and provided you can do so without entering into any kind of commitment, be no objection. r i4 7. It seems probable that the Bhah has not been fully or correctly infomed of what has passed or of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government * It might therefore be well for you to take the opportunity of your audience tomorrow to try to clear up the situation with His Majesty. I do not wish however to fetter your discretion and the following suggestions are therefore purely tentative. 8. In the first place you could emphasise that Hi g naj esty ’ s Government, ever sine e xh. eir undentuking of 1929, have made every effort to promote a favourable and satisfactory settlement of Per so-Iraqi differences* uhev have long considered that the best practical method of bringing shout such a settlement is to begin oy dis posing of the practical difficulties of the situation on the Shatt~el-Arab by the conclusion of a Conservancy Convention which wi 11 have the advantage ox pro vicing ±ot the unified control of this important waterway, ox ensuring that it is kept open for the use ox Slipping of all nations in the most favourable conditions ana ox giving Persia the voice she desires in the control of the approaches to her ports on the Bhatt. His Majesty’s Government have proposed that this Convention should be tripartite as they consider themselves full}' entitled to participate in it owing to the fact that tne c--r» p p.+. , n.?io^it^ of the shinning using one v^atexWc*y is Pritish and that therefore it is mainly British interests that will be affected by the proposed arrni&amp;cmQnu^o Moreover they consider that their paruicioau 10 n will be of real practical adv-xntage to botn uhe parties concern^c a a T j_p ; Tv'ui estv* s Government have repeatedly during the p-m o few . • ef s’.v years ciads tiiisir visws on “this poino wis^r Po Doth, the Persian find the Iraq.!

While however they consider that the conclusion of a Convention on the lines of the draft which they have prepared would be to the best interests of all concerned, they do not wish to let this proposal stand in the way of a direct settlement of the frontier question between Persia, end Iraq* Addressed to Tehran No. 17; repeated to Bagdad i\ 0 • o * ar 267/10/34.) • 4 6 2 | \ s.

He asked, had I thought that it was legally possible for Pis majesty's Government to sign convention seeing that they were not a riparian state. 5. I said that this was a narrow view.

In return for this Iraqi Government would he prepared to accept principle of Abadan anchorage and negotiate necessary agreement. I said that I was convinced that if progress were made on these two points the rest would he easy. 9. His Excellency expressed view that he should further he assured that negotiations would proceed on all the other points and that nothing that had already been agreed upon should he re-opened. He stated that in earlier negotiations much ground had 'been covered 5 a non—aggression and pacific settlement of disputes treaty had been initialled, 5 out ol 1/ articles of treaty of friendship had been agreed upon, and drafts had been put forward by Persian Government on other matters such as bon voisinage, posts and telegraphs, consular matters etc. If Persian Government agreed to tripartite conservancy convention, then let all treaty questions oe settled.

In one respect there are some grounds for this as Iraqi Minister informed me yesterday that when Puri Pasha was here in August he received a telegram from Yasin Pasha announcing his acceptance of tripartite convention. Nuri Pasha had suppressed this telegram.

Shatt-el-Arab. boheily in the course of long private conversation January 8 th gave the following explanation of Iran objection to signature of conservancy convention by His Majesty’s Government. bhact-el-Arab bordered on Iran and Iraq and was a direct concern of those two countries: there seemed no reason or justification for signature of a convention by His Majesty's Government who in spite of their admission of great interests, were not a riparian State. 2. I attribute this view to a desire to settle dispute with Iraq independently and with no appearance of patronage oi pio- tective assistance from any Great mower. boneily went on to &gt;~cate most categorically that there would he absolutely no objection to permanent British participation in commission and he suggested that this might easily be provided for by a separate exchange of Notes.

Position is as described in Mr. Hendel’s letter of January 2nd and in my Saving telegram No. 1 (of January 6 th). It seems most unlikely that any settlement acceptable to Persia can be devised unless Persia is given a share in control of Shatt-el~Arab on lines contenplated in our draft Conservancy Convention. Moreover if Convention is not negotiated now as part of general settle ment, Persians may, when it becomes necessary to revive the proposal, represent their cooperation in Conservancy scheme as a concession to Iraxi and try to secure some new quid - pro quo in return. You may think it well to draw Iraq.! attention to this point. But it is important that neither Persians nor Iraqis should be enabled to allege that failure to reach direct agreement on frontier question was due to insistence of His Majesty's Government on Briiibh participucj-on in Conservancy Convention as part of a general settlement# His Majesty’s Government still regard ultimate conclusion of Tripartite Convention, to which they would be a par ^y&gt; as essential, and as in best interest oi all parties concerned, but they would naturally welcome satisfacuory direct Perso-Iraqi settlement of frontier quesoion, ey^n ip advance, and independently, oi Conservancy Convention, provided freedom of passage for His Majesty’s ships through Shatt in peace or war is not adversely affected oy proposed concession at Abadan. , . . ~ ^ Addressed to Bagdad No* 5*, repeated to iehran No. iO*1 21 9 « ! 1936 HO DISTRIBUTIOIT .HecypHer.- Sir iL Clarlc.

Persian delegation had tried to get equal rights with Iraq in Shatt-el-Arab end to saddle her with responsi bility of refusing British participation in convention. 3. Iraqi Government had now made oificial offer of conclusion of Treaty of Friendship on basis of the 1314 frontier. But they had also put, apparently serai-officially, before the head of Persian delegation two alternatives. 4. One, that all outstanding matters including frontier should be settled in accordance with desire of the Shah (counsellor interpreted this to mean settlement on 1914 basis but with Abadan anchorage) leaving navigation convention, if Persia objected to British participation to be raised again at a more suitaole uine. 5 . Or secondly, that Persian Government should inform Great Britain that they were opposed to British participation in navigation convention. This ^in view* of Iraqi Government’s attitude in favour of British participation it! ,2 k. rv v i I would mean break off of negotiations but leave responsibility on Persia. 6 . Telegram added that Iraqi Government had telegraphed position to their Ambassador at Angora instructing him to get whole situation as above put before the Shell with a view to settlement. 7. Counsellor interpreted this as asking Turkish Government to press the Shah to agree to tripartite navigation convention with Great Britain included. He had doubts whether Turkish Government would agree to do this but thought they might do so in general interest. He suggested, however, personally that Turkish Government would not do it for nothing and seemed to think they might ezpect support in Straits question in return. 8 . Counsellor was most anxious that it should not become known, especially in Bagdad, that he had made this communication to us.

I told him that 1 was a little unhappy about the suggestion that Persian Government should inform His Majesty’s Government that they opposed British participation in convention’. 5. I informed him in general terms of my letter to Kazemi reported in my telegram No. 6 and said that while Yasin Pasha had been speaking at Bagdad and as reported in Bagdad telegram 504 I had been communicating with Kazemi in exactly the same sense. 4. I told him also that on January 4th I had a conversation with Soheili who had seen my letter to Kazemi. I urged the necessity of an early settlement and pointed out that matter should not be difficult. Persian Government had only to accept tripartite conservancy convention (in itself a great concession to them and one for which His Majesty’s Government 'were originally responsible) and Iraqi Government would give them Abadan anchorage. Soheili agreed as to need of early settlement. 5 . I am convinced that all the delay and bargaining is entirely due to Kazemi himself who is trying to go one better than the Shah. I know he deals with this question encirely himself and does little else. 6 . It is worth noting that Iraqi counsellor s expression of 'navigation convention' and not 'conservancy convention' all through though (? grp. omtd. ) special reason to suppose he was drawing any distinction be Ween the two.

In your rdiscussions with Iraqis you will no doubt hear Pun mind possibility that if Persians do not obtain adequate share in control of Shaft-el-Arab as proposed in draft Conse a vancy convention tnej^ - may well decide to intensify development of Bundar Shs.hpur even if this involves sacrificing interests of Mohammerah and Abadan. In that event they might even succeed in obligingAnglo- Persian Oil Company to ship their oil from Bundar Shahpur instead of from Abadan, and effect might be most serious not only on economic position in the Shaft-el-Arab as a result of withdrawal of tanker traffic but also in other obvious directions. (This danger was certainly regarded as real in 1932, when Blkington showed me confidentially detailed plans which Anglo-Persian Oil Company had prepared for taking oil to Bundar Shahpur for shipment, should developments make this necessary, but this should of course not be quoted). It seems clear that Persians in their present frame of mind might not hesitate to sacrifice Persian ports on Shaft-el-.Arab if they felt they were not being given a square deal over participation in the Conservancy Board - Iraqis would therefore oe well advised in their own interests not to be too niggardly in their proposals to Persian government over participation in proposed Board.

Question whether proposed Conservancy Agreement should take form of annex to proposed Perso-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship was not discussed, and there was no sort of agreement on the subject, nor was there any discussion of any draft. In any case, there is no reason why a tripartite instrument should not be annexed to a bilateral treaty. 3. Both Persian and Iraqi Governments are well aware that His Majesty*s Government have, from the first, attached utmost importance to being parties to proposed Convention (see Sir s.

I called on I .Sinister for Foreign Affairs today to enquire actual position of Bhatt-el-Aralo negotiations. I said that I understood Persian delegation at Bagdad had received instructions to agree to invitation to His Majesty's Government to participate in negotiations for Conservancy Bo ard. 2. Minister for Foreign Affairs said Samii had Been informed that Persian Government had no objection to participation of His Majesty's Government in negotiations. I said I presumed this also meant signature of convention. Minister for Foreign Affairs said, No. It was impossible for His Majesty's Government to sign convention which as had been agreed by you in conversation with him at Geneva would only form one of several annexes to treaty of friend ship between Persia -and Iraq. Mien I contested this point of view Minister for Foreign Affairs went on to say that he had discussed with you at Geneva a droit which he had himself drawn up whereby convention should be signed by Persia and Iraq and a third member should sit on commission. Persian Government agreed that this member should be British. 3 . I said this was not at all my understanding of the position nor had I any information that you had agreed, to negotiations on this basis. On the other hand i Anew onau the ...the views of His Majesty’s Government were that negotiations should take place on ‘basis of draft tripartite convention, 193o eciition of which was in their possession. 4. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had never seen this draft and they had not got it. I replied that Mr. Mallet had given it to Nouri Esfandiary and bir A. Clark Kerr to Samii. His Excellency then said he would look further into the matter. Judging from his tone during this conversation I fully expect he will express strongest objections to 1935 draft and to signature by His Majesty’s Government. I- T e asked why His Majesty’s Government should sign this. I replied that our interests in naviga tion of Shatt-ei-Arab justified it and that it would be of advantage to both parties to have a third member friendly to both sides who could assist in cases of differences of opinion. 5. In view of his attitude I felt it quite impossible to press further for his agreement to signature by us without further instructions from you. 6 .

I do not under- Scand why Iraqi Government should have troubled Shah about length of anchorage, unless as a move in a. bazaar bargain. 2. If anchorage is granted main interests which should be safeguarded are: (a) rigi.it o± warsxiips of iraq and her allies to pass between Basra and open sea in all circumstances of peace and war. (b) unified control of conservancy and navigation. 5. (a) will be assured if anchorage is limited to 100 yards in width (see Admiralty letters in my despatches Nos. 501 (of July 25th) and 704 (of October 17th) ? which also show that while anchorage should not extend north of Margate Jetty its southern limit is of small importance). If at any stage satisfactory agreement is in sight on every point except width of anchorage you should report by telegraph. 4. (b) will be secured by proposed Conservancy Convention and I assume Iraqi Government will not cede anchorage unless Convention of at least 50 years’ validity is previously concluded, 5. If anchorage were only l eased for duration of Conservancy Convention and this Convention were given unlimited duration 3 anchorage would theoretically be perpetual, but would revert to Iraq if Convention for any reason ended. This would he satisfactory arrangement for Iraqi Government, and as lease( ‘Mf-J lease could cany with it full sovereignty while it laSted it might ^ssihly be acceptable to ersian Govenment. 6 . .. exsian suggestion in pare graph 6 of Mr. Mallet's letter of November 26th to Mi.

The board was to consist of Iraq and Iran as the two riparian countries concerned, and the United Kingdom as the state owning over 90 per cent of the shipping using the river.The papers cover: Perso-Iraqi negotiations; the question of British participation in the convention; the views of the Shah of Iran; negotiations over the frontier between Iraq and Iran; dredging dues; the navigation of the river; Persian violations of Iraqi territory; the anchorage at Abadan; draft agreements on the frontier between Iraq and Iran; the Persian refusal to allow Iraq any say over the waters (the Karun) that flowed into the Shatt-al-Arab (e.g. folios 262-264); the interests of the Government of Turkey in the issue; the view of the Foreign Office that a single authority was required in order to achieve unified control over the whole waterway system (folios 245-246); quarantine and police posts; and the Port of Basra (budget estimates, and dues and charges).The main correspondents are the Foreign Office, the British Ambassador to Iraq, and HM Minister, Tehran.The French language content of the file consists of approximately ten folios of diplomatic correspondence and treaty drafts.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
