(From the Bengal Hurkaru, Dec. 30.) We believe that it is now pretty generally known that Government is busily engaged in ' spotting' all true and faithful Wahabees, and that its servants are busy ' taking notes' in all directions, which the Government, however, does not intend to 11 prent.' It has been convinced at last, that the most dangerous, subtle, and per severing enemy to its existence as a Government in this country is the principle of Wahabeeism, It possesses a vitality and strength which neither legal enactments nor martial laws can reach ; and as its operations are as silent, and its ramifications as extensive, as its objects are violent and villainous, it is satisfactory to know that itsMis- ciples and admirers are being carefully watched and registered in the three Presidencies. There are few men who object to meet a visible and tangible foe, and Englishmen are the last persons in the world to be alarmed by the number and materiel of their enemies ; but there is something unpleasantly weird and trying in the conviction' that one is surrounded by plots and infernal machines without the slio-htest ability to baffle them or protect himself. When the mutinies threatened to sweep us off the face of the land, we rose with the crisis and met it triumphantly, but circumstances and conditions are changed when the air is full of daggers and we know not who holds them. Every thing then that throws a light on the character of these Wababees and the nature of their opera tions, is of use both to Government and the pub lic. We do not propose to repeat the tale already so well told by Palgrave and others, of the life, wanderings, and views of the founder ofthis bloodthirsty sect ; neither do we desire to trans port our readers to the snowy heights of Bokhara and Badakshan, to trace the progress of the new faith. We only desire to call attention to a peti tion which, according to a correspondent of the GarnaMc Telegraph, was presented to the Governor of Madras in 1850, and which sets forth in a very clear light the nature of the efforts which were made in that Presidency by Wahabees from the Upper Provinces so long ago as 1830. The petition sets out with a decla ration that the Mahomedans of the Carnatic had always enjoyed under the protection of public and defined laws, every just and ascertained civil right with a free exercise of the religious institutions and domestic usages of their ances tors, until the arrival from Rampore of aMoulvee named Mahomed Ally, who secretly made a few vyml ytes, from amongst the Madras Mahome dans, to uitj owu opmioiiri. vv e caiv &gt;|v refrain from commenting on the strong spirit of proselytism which animates the members of this new school of Mahomedan theology, differing in this from all the religions now known except Christianity. Hindooism and Boodhism cannot embark on any such work, as no amount of conviction of the truth and beauty of those creeds, will enable a man to enter those fraternities, supposing him to be so insane as to see any in them. Judaism, beauti ful in its ruins, was never remarkable for the possession of that strong regard for the spiritual interests of those without its pale, as to enter on any laborious or well- organized eftorts for their emancipation. Mahomedanism, with all its passionate fanaticism, is so entirely of this earth, so gross and coarse in all its elements, that so divine a principle as sorrow for anothers's errors and a self sacrificing devotion for his pre servation^ can find no place in it and live. It has no objection to scour wildly over provinces, and force a hateful creed down the throats of reluctant infidels at the point of the sword, but the charity which studies the welfare of another, and resigns much of its own to ensure it, is to be found in too pure and etherial a region for Mahomedanism to reach. Hitherto, then, Christianity has alone attempted to win a world from error and danger to peace and safety, by patient disinterestedness and persuasive kindness. Wahabeesim has ap parently been studying the fact, and attempting to imitate the system. Of course it has produc edone which bears as much resemblance to the original as Hyperion to a Satyr, but as it answers its purpose, Wahabeeism is not prepared to quarrel with it. It has certainly proved effec tive, for it has honeycombed the earth under our feet, and run a series of galleries through the whole of the Bengal Presidency and part of that of Madras. The object of course of these laboured efforts was to establish a sect, having its ramifications in every part of the East, which, on plans being matured, should, in conjunction, rise and declare a religious war against the English, and every Hindoo power in India. The petition proceeds to state that the Moulvee Mahomed Ally paid more than one visit to Madras, his first beinn; the result of cer tain instructions received by him when in Cabul. It does not appear whether he was particularly successful or not on this occasion; but we are disposed to conclnde that there must have been sufficient of an encouraging character in the out ward aspect of things, for we find the Moulvee travelling back to Madras, armed, this time, with formidable works, illustrating and recommending the new dectrine. These were clandestinely circulated, and in process of time bore fruit to an extent, that His Highness, IheKaibMookhtar, with a view to allay the excitement, invited the chief Kazee and the two Mooftees of the Sudder Adawlut, together with other legal and theological luminaries, to examine minutely the new im portations, and '' to report whether such were in strict conformity with the tenets of tbe Maho medan religion.' They were, of course, de nounced as atrociously heretical; and the new teacher, thereupon, handed in a document, in which he pretended to bow before the pronun- ciamento of this miniature Mahomedan Council. This, however, did not altogether satisfy the orthodox party, who appear to have entertained suspicions that they had a slippery character to deal with, and rightly concluded that as they themselves set but little store by truth and fair dealing, the heretic before them was not likely to be more strait-laced. He was accordingly directed to appear in the Mosque on the Friday following, and there address the assembled congregation, in denunciation of the new doc trine, and set forth the nature of the writ ten declaration which ho had handed in to the chief Kazee, duly signed and sealed, in order to allay the excitement which his false doctrines had caused amongst the Mahomedan community. 'Instead of doing this, however, Moulvee Mahomed Ally, Rampoorie, in addressing the assembly, uttered not one word of admission touching the heterodox doctrines in the book, but, on the contrary, sounded the praises of its author in the strongest possible terms.' This is what the world in its usual vulgar phraseology would call a ' sell,' and the orthodox party, it is evident, felt acutely that it was a very uncommon and complete one, for nothing less than the in continent despatch of the daring Moulvee from Madras on board a ship then lying in the roads saved him from the most horrible pains and penalties. With his removal in 1836 ended for the time the excitement that had existed. The editors of the Jami ool Alcbar, and the Tyceer ool Alchar, two Hindoostanee journals published at Madras, are described as converts to the new faith, and as being sedulously employed in defaming the orthodox party. Several others are also mentioned as zealous disciples of the new creed, but we need not mention their names cbi on beii had her t char, madt with and cabin and 1 great board on bo£ injuria to of the i of the C B rough steamed fishing aid of O) were tra ly had t lurk over Those oi Dundee a Harvest ( launched; of her pa Fife side, eeyeral ,m arrivin j i steamed and thr perate a little the ere taken ( Uunde Har&lt; risin rate the exer gers one Mar wh' ken eitl sav anc thi tug tio cee Du. rest maj to I) ment of tin retun have i lisio^ whi l »e m ed th dama Newc all Su Appai the p( being had re busy board f and sh were s effecte- moved was m afloa' - beloi thrc Part on i 'V nat the trai com tem norl of v it U 5.3i sho sun: how viof Hei col spl thr mu gro non con mos cipi' the less no c the to ] tele« the all 1 sem the fron will loco W( to \ to tl Hea. ten f is as atter. hurt on th and b on tl Schoc the fa pupil- knee, a —seve. market David wound t limbs, driver—</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100024117668.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/64, f 1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024117668.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/64, f 1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Newspaper article on 'Wahabeeism'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1866/1866</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-07-27T00:05:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 folio</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Article printed in a Bombay newspaper, and originally taken from the
