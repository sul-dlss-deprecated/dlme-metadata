J enclose a copy of a translation of a letter from the shaikh of Bahrain which i received on the 11th December, 1946. I have discussed the migration with the Shaikh of Bahrain who states that while he does not mind these people leaving Bahrain, he objects to their being settled by the Shaikh of Qatar on land which he claims to be his in Qatar. 3* While, of course, it is not admitted that umm al Ma'a belongs to the shaikh of Bahrain, the rights to the coast line in the Zubarah region have for long been under dispute. I think that for the shaikh of Qatar to settle Bahrainis, as is alleged by the shaikh of Bahrain, at Dtom al Ma*a is offensive to the latter and is also not in keeping with the 1944 Agreement. s &gt;; , I am not fully aware of the cause of the trouble between the shaikh of Bahrain and the emigrants, but understand that some question of a marriage and non payment of a subsidy was involved. . Similar migrations have resulted in more than one serious incident in the past, and I therefore think that we should take notice of this case. Besides which our reaction is probably being watched closely by the shaikh of Qatar, whether or not he is behind the migration as implied by the Shaikh of Bahrain. I therefore suggest that I should write to t ie shaikh 01 Qatar informing him of the sense of paragraph 3 above, and ask him to settle the families away from the dis puted area. Settlements in that area have in the past been a considerable trouble to His Majesty's Government and they do not wish to run the risk of a recurrence. I should be grateful for early instructions.

I inform you that last year I received information that one of our subjects from Al-Bu-Romaih tribe went to Shaikh of Qatar for an agreement (permission) for them to go to Qatar together with their families and boats which have been registered in Bahrain, but that (information) could not be properly confirmed to me* These days, some 20 days ago, some of them (Al-Bu-Rumaih) went to Shaikh of Qatar asking him to settle (them) at Qatar. Twelve days ago they went from our village ummul-Hasam in four boats to Bander ummul-Maa, which is one of the ports belonging to our state Zobarah. This latter has been under our disposal since a long time* They landed there with their luggage with the intention of settling there* As Your Honour is aware that this port is one of our properties,that they went without our consent and that the Shaikh of Qatar has settled them in it (Bander Uinmul Maa), to which we do not agree* Firstly; that it is our port, and since a long time no one has been settling in it without our consent* We have in our possession ownership documents for it, which you saw on the day of our interview with you* Secondly; that they went without our consent, so we request you to remove them from those places which are our own proper ties* U«£* NS*\o 1 \ N o.c /16.

A^ter compliments: I inform you that we received information last year to the effect that one of our subjects of the Buromaih tribe went to the Shaikh of Qatar to make an agreement for the tribe to migrate to Qatar and settle there with their families and boats, which latter have been registered in Bahrain. This information has not properly been confirmed to us. Recently, 20 days ago, some of them did go to the Shaikh of Qatar asking him to settle them in Qatar. Twelve days ago they moved in four boats fron our village Utamul-Hasam and went to Bander ummul i aa, which is one of the ports belonging to Zobara, which has boo u*d«r our disposal since a long time. They landed there and unloaded their luggage with the intention of settling. Your Honour is aware that this port belongs to Zobara, and triat they virent without our consent, where the shaikh of ^atar has (allowed them) to settle, we do not approve of it. rirstlys that it is one of Zobara's ports, where, for a long time, no one might live without our consent, and for which we possess title-deeds which you have seen on the day of our interview with you. Secondly: that they went without our consent, so we request their removal from those places and properties which we regard specially. Usual ending. NS.D.O. No .c /14. The 5th of January, 1947. Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with my Express Letter No.C/1376 dated the 14th December, 1946? 2. in order to clear the position on the Zubarah issue, I have prepared a note summarising the history of zubarah and the case which has arisen over it. I do not claim that it contains all points, but it should be fairly accurate. I hope you may find it of use. 3. With regard to a modus vivendi, the most that can be hoped for is that the two parties should agree to differ. As time has passed relations with qatar have become easier, and although Shaikh Salman misses no opportunity of having a dig at Qatar, in fact communications are more open. To negotiate further might add fuel to the fire, and must involve the fort at Murair over which the Shaikh of Qatar is likely to prove adamant. Since we did not object to its construction it would be difficult now to ask him to abandon it, and£should have to find a quid pro quo which would be difficult, if not impossible. 6.^5 4. Only this morning Shaikh Salman was requesting a settlement of his claim and a reply to his letter dated the 21st May, 1946, failing that he asked if he might refer the question to a committee of Arab Rulers. This was a new move but I replied that the matter was under action. Whatever may be decided in this case, we shall always have to face the obsession over Zubarah which domi nates not only Shaikh Salman but the whole of the Al Khalifah Neither is the Shaikh of Qatar at all likely to retreat willingly from the position he has achieved. The Hon»ble Lt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . NS.1. Zubarah was founded In 1766 by the whole A1 Khalifah division of the Utub. They had migrated from Kowelt. 2. By 1782 they had established supremacy in the Qatar peninsula. Khalifa 3. in 1/83 the A1 with the assistance of other tribes, captured Bahrain irom the Persians, and made it their principal seat. 4. 1782-1842. Fighting and confusion. 5. 1811-1842. Zubarah deserted by the inhabitants many of whom move to Bahrain. 6. Abdullah bin Ahmad of Bahrain bdgan to rebuild Zubarah which was then entirely deserted. 7. in 1843 Mohd, bin Khalifah bin Salman returned to Bahrain from Qatar, expelled Shaikh Abdullah, and became Ruler of Bahrain. 8. 1867, Treacherous and destructive raid by the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Abu Dhabi on Dohah and Wakra. 9. By 1868 the A1 Thani had risen to predominant power in Qatar, how is not known. 10. 1868. Mohd. bin Khalifah removed from Bahrain by His Majesty's Government, isa bin Ali came over from Qatar where he had been residing and was installed Ruler in Bafirain without assistance from His Majesty's Government, He remained Shaikh of Bahrain for 60 years. H. The Political Resident admonished the Shaikhs of Qatar o^retafiation^ ** counter raid - He accepted their plea 12. i86 9 . Muhammad bin Thani and other Qatar shaikhs agreed that the Political Resident should determine what tribute, if any, was due from them to Bahrain and to pay it through the Residency. political Resident recognised that the Shaikh of Bahrain had certain pasturage rights on the Qatar Coas t« 13. 1871, Turks established themselves at El Bida fort. Mohd. bin Thani sent an agent to the Nairn tribe, and made an amicable settlement with them by which some of the tribe settled at El Bida under the Turkish flag. 14. 1872. Turks occupied Dohah. 15. 1872. Shaikh Isa of Bahrain wished to establish a garrisc at zubarah for the protection of the Nairn, but the Political Resident advised him to remain neutral to avoid the A1 ^halifah's becoming entangled with the Turks. (Political Resident reported to Government of India that the Shaikh had not the power to control the Qatar tribes). 16. 1873. The Government of India agreed that the Shaikh oi Bahrain had no clear or important rights in Qatar. 1/. 1876. The Government of India instructed the political Resident to advise the Shaikh of Bahrain that he should not interfere on the mainland. In March 1875 Shaikh Isa replied /to.to the Political Resident»s letter saying that he would refrain from interfering on the mainland 'except our city Zubarah for that Is our property and has been'. The poli tical Resident wrote saying that reports he had received showed an increased necessity for 'avoidance of all inter ference on the mainland (whether at Zubarah or any other place no exception is made)'. The Government of India Instructed the political Resident to make the Shaikh understand clearly that if he persisted in entangling himself in mainland affairs they would hold themselves free to take such action with respect to him as they considered necessary* 18. In 1878 the inhabitants of Zubarah committed a heinous piracy in consequence of which the Government of India Instructed the political Resident to demand of the Turks that the place should be punished and to offer British naval assistance* In the meantime Shaikh Jassim Al Thanl of Dohah had sacked Zubarah. Sheikh Isa of Bahrain requested British help for the Nairn at Zubarah. This was refused and the homeless Nairn, to the number of about 300, took refuge in Bahrain. In 1886 the Nairn of Qatar received large payments from the Bahrain revenues, but the tribe failed to give any adequate return. 19. In 1888 the British Government fearing that the Turks would connive at the rebuilding of Zubarah Informed Shaikh jasim Al Thanl that a settlement by him would not be permitted. In this and the following year a considerable migration of Nairn from Qatar to Bahrain took place. A vague treaty of amity was concluded between the Shaikh of Bahrain and Jassim of Dohah. 20. 1890. Shaikh Jaslm Al Than! endeavoured to Induce the Turks to establish a garrison at Zubarah. 21. In 1890 the Turks were reported to be considering the appointment of a Turkish Mudir for Zubarah. One was appointed by 1896. 22. 1896. The Al bin All, a discontented Bahrain tribe, migrated from Bahrain to Qatar, where, with the consent and support of Shaikh Jasim Al Than! they formed- a settle ment at Zubarah. A Commander pelly was sent to Zubarah to demand the return of the Al bin All. He met with a refusal on the grouhds that they were Turkish subjects and the place a Turkish possession. From this incident a serious threat to Bahrain was checked by Commander Pelly who again visited Zubarah and destroyed 44 armed vessels there, under the peace arrangements the Al bin All returned to Bahrain. 23. in 1896 the Shaikh of Bahrain was informed that he had received the final decision of the Government of India, and that the question of his right to Interfere in affairs on the mainland could not well be referred again; it behoved him carefully to consider his present position and the modi fications it might occasion. 24. In 1896 Jaslm Al Than! wrote to the heads of the Nairn /tribeV' -3- tribe, and offered them the choice of war to the death, removal to Bahrain, or subjection to his authority. Those members of the tribe residing.at Zubarah thereupon made overtures to Muhammad bin Thanl of Bida and asked to be allowed to H transfer their allegiance to him'* 26. Later in 1896 His Majesty's Government informed the porte that they could not permit the Zubarah coast to be considered to lie within Turkish jurisdiction* 26. In 1896 friendly relations with Qatar were restored and the re-opening of trade notified in the bazaars. 27. 1903. A Turkish gunboat left Basra to assist in the warfartrtriiiiBit establishment of guard houses to connect Zubarah and Odaid. The Mudir designate for Zubarah arrived in Hasa in this year, but the porte assured His Majesty's Government later that they had no intention of posting a Mudir for Zubarah. 28. m 1913 by Article H of the Anglo-Turkish convention His Majesty's Government undertook to prevent the Shaikh of Bahrain from interfering in any way in the mainland of Qatar* 29# in 1915 the Turks abandoned Dohah* 30- In 1916 an agreement was signed between His Majesty's Government and 'the Shaikh of Qatar' by which the latter bound himself to fulfil the various obligations already undertaken by the Trucial Shaikhs, and His Majesty's Govern ment undertook to protect him from aggression by sea* 31. In 1922 the Shaikh of Qatar desired to enter into some closer agreement with His Majesty's Government but the Govern ment of India were averse to undertaking liability for his defence against rebellious subjects or invaders from inland. 32. in 1930 the Shaikh again proposed a closer form of agree ment, and met with a second refusal* 33. in 1935 the Shaikh of Qatar gave an oil concession to the Anglo-Iranian oil company enabling them to operate 'throughout the principality of Qatar'. This agreement was followed by a 'political' agreement between His Majesty's Govern ment and the Anglos Iranian Oil company. 34. Zubarah remains almost deserted though tribesmen grazed their flock in that area and members of the Al Khalifah went there on hunting trips from Bahrain. Communications between Bahrain and Zubara continued until 1937. Relations with the Shaikh of Qatar and Bahrain were outwardly friendly. 35. In 1937 the Shaikh of Bahrain received offers from the Bahrain petroleum company, Limited, and petroleum Concessions Limited for the 'Additional Area'. The Hawar Islands and other shoals and islands near Qatar were claimed by Bahrain, and the Shaikh of Bahrain reported to the Political Agent that the shaikh of Qatar had visited Zubarah. in 1938 His Majesty's Government seemed to have been of the opinion that the award of Hawar to Bahrain should be balanced by the award of Zubarah to Qatar (vide paragraph 6 of sir Trenchard powle's note forming enclosure to India Office Complimentary Slip No. P.Z.2904/1938 dated the 30th April, 1938). /36. in36. in 1937 two factions of the Nairn residing in the Zubarah area quarreled over a woman and one faction ''appealed' to the Shaikh of Qatar, The Shaikh possibly influenced by the activities of petroleum Concessions Limited and wishing to demonstrate his authority informed the head of the Nairn at Zubarah that he should swear loyalty to him or be punished. He also threatened to tax the Naimo ihe head of the Nairn appealed to the Shaikh of Bahrain for assistance, who thereupon sent three Bahrain guards to plant the A1 Khalifah flag at Zubarah. He also ordered repairs to the r ort. The Shaikh of Qatar protested to the political Agent who, after consulting the political Resident asked the Shaikh of Bahrain to remove his guards and close down the repair work, two days after writing this letter the political Agent visited Zubarah, and found the guards still there. He wrote to the Adviser requesting him to ask the Shaikh to issue orders for the withdrawal S Uard i' ^ ide Agency letter No.0/333-4/13 dated the 3rd of May, 1937^ — 3 a ^ v &lt;? / • c • ^ ' 37.

P f- , About this period the Shaikh of Qatar built a new fort a few hundred yards from the old fort which he used as material for it. The Shaikh of Bahrain protested to the Political Agent, but the latter, after consulting the Poli tical Resident, did not reply to the Shaikhs letter. (Vide Residency Memorandum N0.477-S dated the 10th April, 1939). L p. 7M vo / C.95 40. in 1944, the Political Agent effected an agreement by which the two Rulers agreed 'to the restoration of friendly arrangements between them as they were in the past'. The Ruler of Qatar undertook that Zubarah should remain in the same state as in the past. (Vide Agency printed Letter No .c /939 dated the 19th June, 1944).e, £&gt;•'$ The Shaikh of Bahrain showed some reluctance in signing the agreement whereupon the political Agent wrote an explanatory letter to him stating that the Shaikh of Qatar was anxious for the restoration of friendship and zziabi friendly communications to the state ante 1936. A copy of this letter was not sent to the Shaikh of Qatar. Soon after the Agreement had been signed the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the political Agent drawing his attention to the fact that the fort built by the Shaikh of Qatar had not existed ante 1936 and asserting that he (the Political Agent) had promised that the position at Zubarah should be restored to its past state and that he had not done this. The Shaikh also asked for the return of the arms taken from the Nairn in 1937 by the Shaikh of Qatar. The Political Agent replied denying that he had made any promises 'either in regard to the restoration of the position to what it was in the past or with regard to the return of arms'. He pointed out that from the phrase 'The Ruler of Qatar undertakes that Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past', it did not appear 'that anything is required to be changed which existed at the time of the Agreement but rather that there should be no new innovation'. The Political Agent added that he would use his personal endeavours to arrange for the wifehdrawal of the garrison of the Zubarah fort and for the return of the whole or some part of the arms. (Vide Agency printed Letter No.1380 dated the 25th September, 1944). C s M ' S l vol c. 9S The Shaikh of Bahrain wrote again to the effect that the fort was a source of humiliation to the Al Khalifah when they visited Zubarah, and again asserted that the Political Agent had 'promised 1 to arrange for the removal of the fort and the guards, and asked him to fulfil his promise. If the political Agent were unable to arrange this the Shaikh of Bahrain wished to know whether there was any objection to his taking up the question directly with the shaikh of Qatar. He added that if the shaikh of Qatar insisted on maintaining the fort and the guard he would close communications with Qatar. The Political Agent again denied that he had made any promise, and referred the matter to the Political Resident (vide Agency letters Nos. C/1424 and C/1425 dated the 4th October, 1944). ( SJ0\ C 1 ^ Li U /On the vol41* On the 2nd December Saleh al Mana', the Shaikh of Qatar*s secretary, informed the Political Agent that the Shaikh of Qatar was willing to withdraw the guards. The Political Agent replied that the Shaikh of Qatar should do so and inform him when this had been done. (Vide Agency printed Letter No.c/1917 dated the 24th December, 1944). ^ s. 5 3 v*! » 42. On the 10th December, 1944, the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the shaikh of Qatar that, in view of the recent agreement, he considered the situation to be r, as it was before the dispute took place'. The Shaikh of Qatar replied that he would be governed by the terms of the Agreement under reference. (Vide Agency P.L. No.0/1789 dated the • 18th December, 1944). The messenger of the Shaikh of Bahrain who carried his letter to Qatar also discussed the possible return of the arms taken from the Nairn. The Shaikh of Qatar is reported to have said that he was agreeable to return them if the shaikh of Bahrain would make a written request. He also informed the messenger that under the 1916 Treaty with His Majesty's Government he could not alienate any part of Qatar and was, therefore, unable to recognise the Al Khalifah claim to Zubarah. (Vide Agency letter No.c/1916 dated the 20th December 1944). s.saL vtfi. r 43. On the 13th January, 1946, the Shaikh of Bahrain asked the political Agent to inform the Shaikh of Qatar that His Majesty^ Government had no objection to his negotiating direct for the removal of the guards. The political Agent thereupon suggested to the political Resident that he should express a hope that the Shaikh of Qatar had by now removed the guards, and should add that any outstanding questions should be dealt with direct by the two Shaikhs. The political Resident agreed and left it to the political Agents discretion to advise the Shaikh of Bahrain verbally that discussion should be con fined to the specific question of the withdrawal of the guards (vide Residency telegram No.113 dated 16.1.1946). L S). $(&gt; vol, C.qs 44. on the 22nd January, 1946, the Political Agent wrote to the Shaikh of Qatar and replied to Shaikh Salman that the Shaikh of Qatar had been informed 'that there is no objection to discussing the question of the Zubarah guards directly with Your Highness'. 46. On the 24th January, 1946, the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the Shaikh of Qatar saying that in the past the Shaikh of Qatar had neither a fort nor a garrison 'in my country Zubarah', and asked him to restore the situation to its former state and also to return the arms taken from the Nairn. (Agency Endorsement no.c /168 dated 3 .2. *46). s v i On the 30th January the Shaikh of Qatar replied that he was surprised to see the Shaikh of Bahrain speaking of Zubarah as his country which 'as everybody knows it is an Inseparable part of Qatar', and that if he wanted the arms back 'in the form of a request, that is a separate question'. On the 1st February, 1946, the Shaikh of Qatar replied to the Political Agent's letter that he had with drawn the guards and there were now only some two or three caretakers left in the fort. The Shaikh of Bahrain there upon wrote to the Political Agent saying that Zubarah had belonged to the Al Khalifah up to the 1937 dispute, and that 'all the people of the Gulf know that Zubarah is one /of-7- ^ L-' 3 • of the Al Khallfah properties In the past and future'. (Vide Agency P.L. No,c/236 dated the 12th February, 1945). 46. The Shaikh of Bahrain asked the political Agent whether he should reply to the shaikh of Qatar's letter and whether, if he did not do so it could beheld that he had accepted the claims made therein. The Political Agent advised him against replying, and gave it as his opinion that such a view could not be held. 47. on the 22nd January, after consulting the Political Agent, the shaikh of Bahrain ordered some 20 of the Nairn who had settled in Baixain to proceed to Qatar with their families and their cattle. They landed at Zubarah on the 23rd, spent the night there, and moved on to Hilwan. On the fourth day of their stay at Hilwan, one of the Shaikh of Qatar*s arms-smuggling patrols informed them that they must move inland, and that they could not now leave Qatar without an exit permit and must pay duty on any commodities received from Bahrain. The Shaikh of Bahrain complained to the political Agent who replied, after consulting the Political Resident, that the Political Resident had never supported the Shaikh of Bahrain^ claim to the Zubarah area, and that he was at liberty to take the matter up with the Shaikh of Qatar direct. (Vide Agency printed Letter No. C/366 dated the 15th March, 1945). £ v -&gt;: c ' T 48. The Shaikh of Bahrain did not take the matter up with the Shaikh of Qatar, but continued to make recurrent complaints to the Political Agent (a) that the Bahrainis sent to Qatar were ordered to move away from the Zubarah area and threatened with the cutting of their tent ropes if they did not move, (b) that they must pay duty on their supplies from Bahrain, (c) that Bahrainis going to the western coast of Qatar to collect lime were turned back by the ha a r of Qatar^ patrols and sometimes ill-treated (vide c , Agency D.O. No.p.12 dated 23rd August, 1945), and (4) that v Bahrain! boats were charged harbour fees at Qatar ports. (In fact a tax on the export of juss which had previously been Imposed by the Shaikh of Qatar - cf. Agency telegram No.84 dated the 23rd April, 1937). 5. l , v«5 / • ^ ^ 9 49. On the 21st May, 1946, the Shaikh of Bahrain wrote to the political Agent referring briefly to the events leading up the 1944 Agreement and contending that while he had kept to it and allowed Qataris to visit Bahrain, the position at Zuoaran had not been restored to that prior to the 1937 trouble, (vide Agency letter No.c/622 dated 11 .6.1946). ( ^ • ^3 vol 50. in July, 1946, the politicalAgent visited Qatar.

Vvitn regard to the Shaikh's request that he mi^ht refer his claim to ^ubarah to a committee of Arab rulers, 1 would suggest that if he returns to the charge you should call his attention to the statement contained in the Political Agent Bahrain's letter No.C/562-4/13 dated 19th July 1937 to his father to the effect that 'His Majesty's Government is the ultimate authority for deciding questions regarding ownership between Shsikhs'. If he wishes to pursue a claim to the ownership of Zubarah, which is presumably what he means, he should put In a formal and detailed representa tion for transmission to His Majesty's Government. I trust however that you will do your best to discourage him from submitting such a claim. 5. If the Shaikh wishes to repudiate the agree ment which he signed on 23rd June 1944 on the grounds that he did not fully understand its contents, I should see no grave objection, and we should be relieved of a certain amount of embarrassment. On the other hand it is desirable if possible to avoid a return to the state of blockade which existed between Bahrain and Qatar before the agreement. Sic. Lieut.-Colonel A.C.

I have the honour to reply to the letter which Your Highness addressed to me on the L5th May 1946 on the suoject of Zuberah, 2* I regret that I have been unable to reply to this letter before. The reason was thet I considered it necessary to consult the Hon'ble the Political Resident and obtain his instructions before replying, and as Colonel Hay had only recently assumed charge as Political Resident he wished to study all the papers about this complicated question and visit Zubarah itself before expressing any opinion regarding it. He has now authorised me to reply to you as follows. 3# It is true that the agree ment with the Shaikh of ^atar wnich Your Hifchness signed on the ii3rd June 1944 v.as effected as a result of the mediation of Major Hickinbotham who was then Political A^ent Bahrain and it is to be presumed therefore that Major Hickinbotham knew what the words used were meant to convey. With regard to the interpretation of the clause which Your Highness quotes, viz., 'The Ruler of Qatar undertakes that Zubarsh will remain without anything being done in it which did not exist in the past', Wajor Hickinbotham has himself in his letter No.C/1372 dated 23rd September 1944 said that this does not mean that everything is to be restored in Zubarahi r - 2 - as it Vr&amp;s in 1D36 but that there shall be no nev innovation after the signing ( of the agreement. The Political Resident ana I recently visited Zubarah and so far as *.e can sre there has cert?;in]y been no new innovation and apart from the Ghaikh of Qatar f s fort at Murair the whole piece is ruined and deserted. The fort in question was built several years before the agreement of 1944 and the Shaikh of Qatar cannot be c lied upon to oostroy it under the a^ree-nent, in ^cooruanc® with the - \ inlerpretation ^iven above, ilajor Hi ck in bo t ham v^as however successful in persuading the Shaikh of Qatar to withdraw the garrison and when we visited the place it was occupied by only two aaturs. 4. I have mfioe enquiries into complaints received from Your Highness from time to time and have been unable to obtain any clear evidence that the Shaikh of Qatar is persecuting your subjects or Imposing more restrictions on them than on other foreigners entering his country. V/hen Your Highness* subjects enter Qatar they must naturally expect to be called upon to comply with the laws of the country in the same way as Qatar subjects have to observe Your ilithness 1 laws and regulations when they visit Bahrain. 6. In the circumstances explained there appears to be nothingA 1 ^ - 3 - to substantiate Your Highness* complaint that Shaikh Abdullah is not observing his side of the agreement and there are no grounds for makint any protest to him, 6, In conclusion I wish to assure Your Highness that I will always do ny best to persuade the Shaikh of Qatar to observe the terns of the a^ree- ment should there be any evidence that • he is felling to do so. At the same time I hope Your Highness will observe your side of the agreement and do your best to maintain good relrtlons uith Qatar, and avoid a return to the state of affairs which existed before 1944. xTHE AGENCY BAHRAIN D.o.

A further point which is now confirmed is that the Shaikh of Bahrain himself is not acting upon the terms of the Agreement of 1944. Recently he has for bidden the export of lorries (3 in number I think) to Qatar. This is in contravention of the Agreement since Qatar should be entitled to the benefits of R.E. 3. I tackled the Shaikh on the subject and he replied that any article for P.C.L. itself would be subjected to no restrictions, but that for Qatar sub jects he proposed to maintain an embargo pending a settlement of the Zubarah dispute. He said that he regarded the prevention of the export of lorries with particular importance because it was by means of lorries that »his people' were attacked at Zubarah. This is rather childish, but his whole attitude is impossible over the present dispute. ,4. Actually the situation in Zubarah itself has slightly improved for I understand that the Shaikh of Qatar has sent an official with a representative of the Shaikh of Bahrain and has publicly told villagers and nomads in the Zubarah area that they will be left in peace and that they may import food from Bahrain free from payment of dues. The Shaikh of Bahrain has not admitted this to me because, and I presume that he prefers to maintain his attitude that all that he does is right, and all that Abdullah does is wicked. 5. This morning the shaikh attacked me from a new angle, and pointed out that for old friends like the A1 Khalifah His Majesty's Government did nothing to assist in obtaining their rights for them, but for Arabs newly settled in a territory we did everything. The raising of the status of the ex-Amir of Trans Jordan to that of King seemed particularly aggravating and Glubb came in for much praise as an efficient Adviser. At first I thought that the Shaikh was striking out towards a revision of his treaties, but on enquiry I learnt that this was not the case, and that Zubarah was being pressed once again. Nevertheless the point is of interest and shows a working of the Shaikh's mind. 6. As regards re-export of P.C.L. equipment, I am discussing the point with Lermitte.

NS. •£~ I &amp; lljilHI* pb Translation of letter dated the 3rd Rabi II, 1366, (23rd February, 1947), from the shaikh of gatar to the Political Agent, Bahrain. After compliments; I thank you very much for your letter No .c/187 dated the 13th February, 1947 (23rd Rabi al-Awv/al, 1366). I fully appreciate your interest in your efforts to improve relations among neighbouring States, for which efforts I am sure you will be praised because of your intention to take into consideration the interest of both parties. For this, you deserve the best thanks and the highest con sideration. But you are fully aware that I have done my besl co achieve this object and carried out all in my power to link up the ties of unity and friendliness. But have such efforts been expended by the other party? 0' Your Excellency, you realise that the pressure exerted by Bahrain on ^at.ar is very severe, and it has been increasing in severity, (jatar subjects are facing difficulties which are not present in other cases. They do not receive in Bahrain the same facilities as other countries have been receiving to the extenc that the transhipments granted to others are reiused to them, and the goods destined for abroad are not allowed (shipment) for ^atar at a time when they are allowed for any destination. All this implies that the Bahrain attitude towards us is not friendly. Besides, Hahrain has opened Its gates to all those persons who would come to it trom the Qatar peoples and tribes, welcoming them ana endeavouring by every way of enticement and propaganda, while we are keeping patience, and because of our good intention, and our appreciation of the freedom of the indi viduals, we have not complained to Your Excellency. As regards what Shaikh Salman has told you about the al-Bu-Rumaih, Your Excellency is aware that they have emigrated from Baurain with the knowledge, consent and permission of shaikh Salman, and without our asking or inviting them; nor had we any knowledge about them. They arrived in (Jatar as guests, and [our 'jviceliency understands the Arab customs and their usual practices, such as welcome and hospitality. And when they expressed their desire to settle, we did not consider it proper to shut the door in the face of a noble tribe ariived as a guest, in pursuance of the customs, we have allowed theM to settle like other settlers, without meaning any harm. By my doing so I cannot find any cause to trouble Shaikh Salman, so long as he himself had allowed them to migrate. Ve are in the 20th century, and under the super vision of noblemen who sacrificed their blood for the k &amp; Mjs sake en democracy and freedom. If your Excellency would make enquiries, you would find that some of the .atar tribe 8 and people left Qatar and settled in Bahrain, where it pleased them to settle and v/here they were well received. Tn future, if Shaikh Salman v/ishes us to adopt a definite procedure necessitated by circumstances, and it be under youi supervision, we are prepared to come to an agreement on mutual basis, should this proposal appeal to Your Excellency and ; naikh Salman, I would put up my proposal on which the idea of reciprocality will be based. Usual ending. I !i14 The 8th March, 1947. His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla bin Qasim Al Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar. After compliments; I thank Your Excellency for your letter of the 3rd Rabi II, 1366 (23.2.47). J am sorry to hear that you consider that Bahrain puts pressure on Qatar and that thisjis increasing. it is, of course, true that Bahrain's relations with her neighbouring states differ in some respects. This is normal in the world today and I am indeed happy that your Excellency is thinking in terms of permanent friendly relations between the two states and wishidto make an agreement on a mutual basis, indeed I should be most happy to assist in this, but before I do so I shall address our friend Shaikh Salman and I must also refer to the Hon'ble the political Resident. 2. In the meantime would your Excellency please refer to paragraph 2 of my letter NQ.c/187, dated the 13th February, 1947, and prevent the Al Bu Romaih from establishing themselves on the north-western shores of Qatar.

If you agree to Galloway's suggestion in the second paragraph of his demi-official letter first quoted I would now write to the Shaikh of Bahrain informing him that the Shaikh of Qatar states that (a) the Al Bu Rumaih have emigrated from Bahrain with his knowledge, consent ^ a and permission. f i v there have been similar migrations of Qatar tribes to Bahrain.

I would add that, provided Shaikh Salman is anxious to reach an agreement in the matter , I would be prepared— to ask the Shaikh of Qatar for specific proposals. I am conscious that this suggestion is a red herring across the track of the main issue, and I have very little expectation that an accommodation will be reached; but I see no other course of action open to us.

As indicated in our conversation, my comments are:- (i) A matter concerning even indirectly,the relations between Bahrain and ^atar cannot be described as merely a question of the Shaikh of Bahrain's 'internal rights'; (ii) Ranee's letter (apart from the fact that it appears to have been suggested by the Shaikh, and certainly was suggested by Belgrave) was a request, and more of a request for a courtesy than anything else. It is ridiculous to describe this as inter ference 'in my country and my subjects'. (iii) I resent most strongly the Shaikh's action in writing to you without first addressing me. I understood you to say that you were agreeable to replying to his letter by asking him to address me. , r . IS 3.

The Adviser then said that H.H. had told him before leaving the Adviserate that morning, that the man might be released if the Agency wished this to be done, and the Adviser said this would be done, but suggested I should write to him about it.

I have 'to comment as follows. As the man who was arrested was of course one of the ♦ Ar-Rumaih 'and his arrest was clearly connected with the Bahrain-^atar dispute, I am unable to understand why it should be described by Your Highness as merely a question of your 'internal rights'. It would be v perhaps more reasonable to argue that the settlement of the Ar-Rumaih in Qatar was a question of the internal rights of the Shaikh of Qatar. I am furthermore entirely unable to 'accept Your Highness's description of my assistant's request for v/hat was very largely a courtesy as an interference with your sub- jects and country. • 4. fhe divergence of Your Highness's and my views in this matter clearly makes it vain for me to try to help in connection with the settlement of the Ar-Rumaih in Qatar.

Your esteemed letter No.561 dated the 11th May, 1947 (21st Jamadah Ath-Thani, 1366) has been received, and I reply to the reference made by you to my letter of the 2nd Jamadah Ath-Thani, 1366 (22nd April, 1947) and to the contents of your letter regarding Jasim bin Muhammad (as follows):- First; I inform you that Jasim bin Muhammad is a Bahrain national and I have the absolute right to arrest him; he is my subject and the Shaikh of Qatar knows about it. Secondly: The order for his detention was passed before his arrival at Bahrain; for he had shortly before left Bahrain, vide my letter No.35/1366 d&amp;ted the 10th • P ^ Muharram, 1366 (2nd December, 1946) concerning him and his fellow people. After he had traversed the country, from Hid to Umm-al-Hasah and Manamah, causing disturbance among the tribes, we wished to return him to where his fellow people were living, i.e., to one of the sea-ports of Zubarah, as was indicated in my previous letter. You say that you try in vain to help us in connection with the Bu-Rumaih. You promised in your letter No.c/224 dated the 18th February, 1947 (27th Rabi Awwal, 1366), which you may refer to and also refer to your letter No.c/410 dated 30th March, 1947 (29th Jamadha Awwal, 1366) which was in reply to my letter No.522 dated the 4th Jamadah Awwal, 1366.

On Saturday, 17th May, about noon, Mr. Belgrave asked if he could see me and came over to the Agency shortly afterr/ards. He told me that he had just come from an interview with the Shaikh and that the latter had said that he did not want bad relations with the Agency and wondered whether he should see the political Resident or myself about the correspondence which had taken place as a result of the incident regarding Jassim bin Mohammed and of the Shaikh's letter complain ing of the 'interference' of Captain Ranee in his internal affairs. I said that I also wished for good relations with the Shaikh, but that if he wished to come to see me it would be vain for him to enter into discussion as to the merits of his arrest and imprisonment of Jassim bin Mohammed since what I was concerned with was his letter complaining of the Assistant Political Agent's interference, and I wanted an explanation of what amounted to an accusation against the A.P.A. before I could consider {ilSKHXxisK discussing the merits of the case of Jassim bin Mohammed, or indeed any other case connected with Qatar. Mr. Belgrave said that he would try to get the Shaikh to give an explanation of his statements about the A.P.A. and I said that the A.P.A. should be present. The Shaikh came to see me this morning. May 20th, and in an interview which lasted an hour and twenty minutes, the Shaikh gave as much an explanation as one is likely to get out of him. The note herewith gives an account of the gist of the conversations. The A.P.A. was present throughout. Sd./- C.J. PELLY 20th May, 1947./(i) No^e of an interview between His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and the political A^ent at which ?.ir. Bel^rave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Governrient, and Optain iance were present. His Highness expressed his feeling for friendship for and desire for good relations with the political Agent, He stated, however, that the Shaikh of Qatar had caused mis understanding by sending Jassin bin r ohaniraed to Bahrain, and, inquired whether this man Jassim bin K'ohammed was not one of his subjects. The Political Agent pointed out that in his experience of the rulers of the Arab coast he had never seen a letter like that sent by His 'lighness in reference to the Assistant political Agent. He pointed out that there was no question of the Assistant political Agent demanding the release of Jassim bin J.'ohamiaed, all he had done was to suggest tha^ the man's incarceration should be deferred until the Folittcal Agent returned to Bahrain; and he had done this at the sug- gestion of His Highness*s Adviser. His Highness could have replied that it was impossible to postpone the arrest of the man, but instead of doing so he wrote a letter to blame not only the interference of the Assistant political Agent in this case, but in several other instances. This letter made a general accusation, but did not quote instances and when in the political Agent's letter to the Shaikh he asked for instances he received no reply. Che Shaikh replied to this that his relations with the Political Agent were far different and far closer to that between the political Agent and other rulers. He then quoted cases to support his allegation of the Assistant Political Agent's interference, viz.,nlni! (i) two letters regarding the nationality case of Hu^sain Nama*. (ii) releases of cars for (a) Sal eh Al Ifana'* (b) Abciulla oarwish (two cars). He added that he was ready enough to release anything required from the island for P.C.L. (even one of His Highness's own cars, if necessary). The political Agent pointed out that the Agency was an office and did not depend upon the personality of the political Agent or the Assistant political Agent. Whatever official letters issued from it, issued as Agency letters and whether signed by the Assistant political A&lt;ent or by the political Agent, the latter was responsible for them. The Assistant Political Agent pointed out that the release of the car for Saleh Al l T ana' was froc the Qatar quota of cars which came to ^atar through Bahrain. The Shaikh referred to the political Agent's statement in his letter No.C/561, dated the 11th of T'ay, 1947, that he was unwilling to help in the natter of the Ar-Rumaih, and asKed - if the Political Agent did not help him, who would help him? The Political Agent pointed out that ho could hardly be expected to help when there was an accusation made by the Shaikh against the Assistant Political Agent unsupported .by instances. The Jhaikh said that if anyone belonging to the Agency, from the Assistant political Agent to a farrash, gave him cause for complaint, he would complain to the Political Agent. As for the Political Agent's statement that he would not help him, if that was to s-and, then, he would not ask for help; he had given his reply regarding the allegations about the Assistant political Agent. /The. »The political Agent asked the Assistant political Agent whether he had anything to add. He saii that he was satisfied if the political Agent was. It should have been mentioned that when discussing the letter written by His Highness regarding the Assistant political Agent, the'shaikh pointed out that in a previous case when a letter had been written to which the Political Agent (Colonel Galloway) took exception, he had withdrawn the words objected to from the letter. It should also be recorded that the political Agent made the point that both letters in the Hussain Nama' case were drafted by the political Agent himself even if signed by the Assistant political Agent.

The development which brought to a head my conviction that the position is deteriorating was, of course, the receipt of the Shaikh's letter complaining of Ranee's 'interference'. As I said in ray demi-official letter No.C/560, dated the 10th of May, 1947, I have never seen such a letter from a Shaikh referring to a political Officer in such terms; and it seems to me to argue a change - and an unfavourable change in the Shaikh's attitude towards us. This I thought I had already noticed in a few other cases. In that concerning the proposal for a Director of Education, the fact that Kuwait does not have one was quoted as a reason for Bahrain's refusing one; and again in the discussions concerning the proposed formation of a landing company, Kuwait was quoted: while in one of Ranee's cases about motor cars Belgrave mentioned the Shaikh's belief that the political Agent did not control their sale in Kuwait. /3. I spoke to on'ble Lt—Col• W.R. Hay, C•S.I., C.I.^., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, — B A H R A IN.3.- I spoke to Belgrave at some length on the undesirability of regarding Kuwait as an example to be followed since the state of its government is in every respect unworthy of imitation- Belgrave admitted that^ and said that the Shaikh was aware of it, but,on my suggesting it to hin^he agreed that the Shaikh 'sometimes' chafed at our control. 4. However we regard it, and however the general public regard it, I believe that the Arab rulers in this Agency who think about these subjects at all (and in that category I include the Shaikh of Bahrain) look upon our policy in Egypt, RxjbixttKS and India as recessive; and as they would never recede themselves unless forced to, they believe that we are acting through weakness. This, I imagine to be a factor in the change of attitude of the local Shaikh towards us.

This information has not properly been confirmed to us* Recently, 20 days ago, some of them did go to the Shaikh of Qatar asking him to settle them in Qatar. Twelve days ago they moved in four boats from our village TThimul-Hasam and went to Bandar Ummul Maa, which is one of the ports belonging to Zobara, which has been under our disposal since a long time. They landed there and unloaded their luggage with the intention of settling, your Honour is aware that this port belongs to Zobara, and that they went without our consent, where the Shaikh of Qatar has (allowed them) to settle. We do not approve of it: Firstly: that it is one of Zobara T s ports, where, for a long time, no one might live without our consent, and for wks which we possess title- deeds which you have seen on the day of our interview with you.

Our friend Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifah has informed me that recently a section of the Al-Bu- Romaih migrated from Bahrain to Qatar, and that Your Excellency has settled them at Umm al Maa. It is clear that these people have left Bahrain, but I am not actually aware if they are at TTmm al Maa or not. Your Excellency is fully aware that much of the trouble between Bahrain and Qatar in the past has arisen from the migration and movements of tribesmen with their families between the north western coast of Qatar and Bahrain. His Majesty's Government have been at great pains in the past to assist in the settlement of these troubles and in order to avoid a recrudescence, and for the benefit of all parties, I have to ask you to prevent the establishment of the Al-Bu-Romaih on the north-western shores of Qatar.

The reason for this is that having heard the Shaikh of Qatar on the subject of the emigration of the Ar Rumaih to TTm al Maa', and having visited the Ar Rumaih at Um al r/'aa^ and having again heard the Shaikh of Bahrain at his usual length on the subject, I believe that the draft proposed by me is unsuitable. The real point is that made in paragraph 2 of Galloway's letter No .c /314 and replied to by the Ruler of Qatar in his letter dated the 7th Jamadah Awwal, 1366 (28.3. , 47). (Copies of these letters went sent to you with Galloway's demi-official letter No .c /338 dated the 10th March, 1947, and my demi- official letter No.C/434 dated the 6th April, 1947.) The Shaikh of Bahrain, as I must admit was originally^''pointed out by Galloway in his Express Letter No.C/l376-'0f the 14th December, 1946, has no objection whatsoever to the Ar Rumaih emigrating from Bahrain to Qatar; what he objects to is their being settled in Um al Maa' - in territory which (t think vopy usually by implication) he claims to be his.

Besides, it would do absolutely no good. I am inclined to think that having asked the Ruler of Qatar to remove the Ar Rumaih we should take action against him for refusing to do so. 2. In his monologue, lasting an hour and a half, of yesterday and on several similar occasions, the Shaikh of Bahrain no longer spent so much time in arguing that the Shaikh of Qatar has failed to observe the agreement concluded through the mediation of Hickinbotham. His main attack is now directed at claiming (a) his privileges; (b) his properties in Zubara. As regards (a) he relies on a letter which he received from Galloway from which J enclose the relevant extract. His claim to 'his properties'* is also, he says, supported by a letter from Galloway though I have been unable to find any such letter. With regard to the Shaikh's claim to 'his privileges' I should be glad if I could be told what I should reply to him.Extract from letter No.C/324 dated the 9th March, 1947, from Lt-Col. A.G.

This, however, is not a very cogent argument since it is one thing to promise the Shaikh of Bahrain 'every hospitality and a good reception' in Qatar, and an entirely different matter to admit that he has 'privileges' in Qatar. ^ v 4.

I, however, wish to invite your attention that there is a group (number) of Na'im tribe, whose landing at Qatar is not desirable; they always proved to be the cause of trouble and disturbance which were advisable to obviate. 17e will not allow such people coming from Bahrain to land at Qatar, lest there should be what might disturb the present situation.

BAHRAIN the 16th September 1947 Will you please refer to my demi-official letter No.l646-S dated the 26th August, 1947, to Bance 7 2. I visited Shaikh Salman on the 8th and as was to be expected it was not long before he started to ta?k about Zubarah* The following is a summary of the conversation. 3. He asked what were the 'privileges 1 to which I had referred. I pointed out that I had written in the past tfinse -• which he admitted -• and that since the A1 Khalifah had come from Zubarah to Bahrain it was he who should tell me, and not I him. He said that he wanted my reply since that might enable him further to substantiate his claim to Zubarah today. I replied that I had no detailed knowledge of the A1 Khalifah when they were in Zubarah, and that neither I nor Government, admitted that he had rights or privileges (other than as agreed upon by the Shaikh of Qatar) in Zubarah, and that I was not going to make any admission on that score. 4. He requested me either to write and state that he had no claim or else to make the Shaikh of Qatar act in accordance with the Agreement. To the former I pointed out that I should do nothing of the sort, since whenever I visited him either as Political Agent, or Political Resident, he never failed to mention the subject and I never failed to give him a long hearing. As regards the latter I said that I was not convinced that he himself was keeping to the Agreement which in any case concerned Zubarah and should not be brought to bear on all disputes between Qatar and Bahrain. For instance he congratulated himself on welcoming some sons of Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Jassim to Bahrain to attend the Mission Hospital. When I pointed out that the Shaikh of Qatar had stated that he would welcome him to Qatar he replied, as usual, that he did not trust Abdullah bin Jassim and that he wanted his 'freedom'. I pointed out also that the Shaikh of Qatar had expressed himself willing in writing to make detailed proposals regarding the Agreement which he the Shaikh, had not accepted. 6. Shaikh Salman said that he had proofs of his rights to which I replied that I was not Political Resident, and that the permanent incumbent of this post would soon return, and thet doubtless he would then have an opportunity of further representing his case should he wish to do so.

He refused to admit any private rights of the Al Khalifah in Zubarah and said that if they claimed any graves there they could dig up the contents and remove them to Bahrain if they wished to do so. He said if the Al Khalifah merely wished to come to Zubarah for hawking his country was at their disposal. He.did not strike me as feeling very deeply on the subject and I do not consider it is beyond the bounds of possibility that he may in due course be persuaded to make some concession. 2.

Your Excellency mentioned that the Shaikh of Qatar is under no obligation to refrain from visiting Zubarah without informing us. We inform you that we consider this as unfairness ^ towards our rights in Zubarah and that we did nob expect this from Your Justice.

In this connection (please) refer to Your Excel lency's letter No.720, dated the 21st June, 1947 (3rd Sha'ban, 1366).

Reference your Excellency's letter No.1158 dated the 3rd December, 1947, regarding our assertion of the aggressions made by Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim, Shaikh of Qatar, in Zubarah. We beg to invite Your Excellency's attention that Shaikh Abdullah has now ploughed the land and is utilising the water of our two wells for cultivation. These two wells and the land are our property; they were formerly used, with a permission from us, by one of our subjects, namely Fadhil bin Muhannah An-Ni f aimi. Your Honour might remember that the agreement concluded between us and the Shaikh of Qatar (lays down); 'That none of the parties shall cause any new change to take place over what was previously existent'. Changes have been brought^about by the demolition of some buildings and the utilisation of the water, which, as we have previously referred to in our letter to the Political Agency on the same subject, is incongruous with the agreement.

The A1 Khallfah may possess private rights there but the Shaikh of Qatar is the Ruler and it is for him to decide whether any such rights should be recognised or not. NOTEi ~ We do not possess jurisdiction over Muslim foreigners in Qatar, but we should, if possible, avoid mentioning this. The agreement of 1944 was made through the ^ood offices of the British authorities. In these circumstances we will do what we can by persuasion to see that its terms are observed but are under no obligation to use force for this purpose. Either party is at liberty formally to repudiate the agreement. If the Shaikh of Bahrain so wishes, he may present to us a detailed statement of his claims with documents in support, and we will pass this on to the Shaikh of Qatar and ask him to state his side of the case if he does not admit his claims. If the parties agree to submit the dispute to an arbitrator we will do our best to bring about a settlement by this means. Alternative!; we have no objection to a settlement by direct negotiations between the two Rulers and consider that/more satisfactory result is likely to be obtained by this means. oOocor^i^EriTiAL .

Shaikh Salman might be approached in the^note enclosed with your demi-official letter No.143^3, dated the 15th Jan- uary, 1948, I enclose a copy of demi-official letter No. 696-45SF dated the 3rd February, 1948, which I have received from Belgrave which makes it unnecessary for us to take the initiative. The Shaikh's approach is, as usual, |b. 88 question-begging and stupid, and I am tempted to suggest our writing to him that with the exception of his question about private rights beyond the sea-bed boundary about which J am replying to him, there is no issue outstanding between him and ourselves regarding the dispute with Qatar; it is, however, better, I suppose, to show ourselves accom- modac and I, therefore, support the Shaikh's request for an interview with you. Specifically referring to the 'Note' wich your letter I would say:- Paragraph 1 . I may have misunderstood this, but presumably neither this paragraph nor the paragraph prefacing the 'Note' contemplate a settlement of outstanding questions between the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar in a court of law? The parcies are, after all, ruling sovereigns even if only in a small way, and their disputes must, I am sure you will agree, be dealt with politically. I entirely agree that Che question - - of jurisdiction should be avoided. Paragraph 2 .

It should be emphasized that they must be specific; he should be told that nothing can be done about vague complaints regarding vhe abuse of his 'HAQOOQ'. jU all coses, we should avoid following che unfortunate precedent of 1944 by taking the ini:iacive where it was neither desired nor desirable, and thus assuming responsibility^ which we were, practically speaKing, unable to enforce.Confidential .

What I would like to do is to give His Highness an assurance that the sea-bed division does not affect private rights, but I am fairly certain that he will immediately seize upon it as establishing his private rights to pro perties at Zubarah and, possibly, other places on the Qatar mainland. I don't think there is anything to be alarmed about at this prospect, but will it be all right if the Shaikh quotes our 'assurance' as a justification for his claims on the mainland while His Majesty 's Government have apparently only authorised us to assure him that his nationals' rights in Bahrain waters are not affected? You will agree also that the Ruler of a State cannot be described as a 'national' thereof. 3.

I asked the Shaikh to submit a clear statement of the property and privileges which he claimed in ^atar with a view to discussing them with Shaikh Abdullah but I pointed out that I could not promis a succesiful result and that I was not willing to issue anything in the nature of an order to Shaikh Abdullah to recognise the Shaikh of Bahrain's claims.

It is perhaps the most marked distinction between him and the Western min.

It is proposed to reply to the Shaikh of Bahrain that Fadhil bin Muhannah ( 'or his heirs at law ) are at liberty to do so^ and that the words quoted by him do not exist in the 1944 agreement which is irrelevent to Fadhil bin Muhannah^ claim. 6.

We have asked him to put his new arguments in writing and will pass them on to you with our comments in due course. In the meantime we feel we ought to tell you that, apparently as a result of his conversations with Belgrave during his recent visit to Bahrain, he stressed the seriousness of the Shaikh's attitude towards the Zubarah question and rather vaguely suggested that if some arrangement could be arrived at whereby the Shaikh of Bahrain were given freehold rights over at least the ruins at Zubarah he might be more easily prevailed on to accept the decision regarding the division of the sea bed. Failing some concession regarding his Zubarah claim, Ballantyne suggested that the Shaikh may take the opportunity of his forthcoming visit to England to appeal to His Majesty. In reply we told Ballantyne that Zubarah and the division of the sea bed were two distinct questions and that we would not confuse the issue regarding the division of the sea bed by linking it with Zubarah. Ballantyne apparently accepted it that this new line was unlikely to succeed and said he would write and tell Belgrave. We have now received a lettef from Ballantyne in which he gives an extremely contentious record of our conversation and says that he proposes to report to the Shaikh of Bahrain 'the failure of my persoaal mission to His Majesty's Government on his behalf for further consideration of the long outstanding question of his rights in Zubarah'. We have told Ballantyne that at no time in the course of our conversation did we regard this as a mission on behalf of the Shaikh and that if he wishes to write to the Shaikh reporting his conversation with us he should say that now, as in the past, the channel through which His Highness's views should be expressed to His Majesty's Government should be the Political Agent, Bahrain.

I now enclose a short note giving developments up-to-date. 4 ' '' 3. The following are my comments on the Shaikh's letter: (1) It is so vague that even if the Secretary of State could grant the demands, they could never be enforced. The Shaikh's attitude and that of Belgrave is that he has now made a great concession by limiting his claim to one of 'private ownership' (vide paragraph 9 (b) ). Nevertheless in paragraph 2 for the transla- - i ■* tion of 'predominance' he uses ' — ' which is all right as a translation, but is not very far away from sovereignty. What he really wants is extra territorial rights which the Shaikh of Qatar will never concede. (2) Paragraph 9 (c). This refers to Article 2 of the Deed of Further Modification dated the 29th De cember, 1934, executed between the Shaikh of Bahrain and BAPCO. (3) Paragraph 6 and by implication paragraph 9 (f) are threats, but I do not think they need be taken very seriously. ^ 4. I have attempted a draft of which I enclose a copy.

CONFIDENTIAL RE CORDS jvery patient for very long and that it is time the Shaikh was told some truths. The reference to his administration being unchanged for 20 years, of course, refers to Belgrave. You will note that the door is not closed to the Shaikh's claim^since in paragraph 4 I suggest in effect that the onus should be put clearly upon him to accept the full implications of the alleged reduction of his claim to one of 'private rights' only. If he does so accept this, it will be up to us to obtain such rights for him in Zubarah and the Shaikh of Qatar will not be able to quote Bahrain's claim to sovereignty as a reason for refusing them.4 IKS j\^l- NOTE ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ZUBARAH CASE S®CE THE ISSUE OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENTS DESPATCH NO.C/767, DATED THE 26th AUGUST, 1946, TO HIS MAJESTY 1 S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA, INDIA OFFICE, LONDON. 1. In December, 1946, the Shaikh of Bahrain complained that some of his subjects of the Al-Bu-Romaih tribe left Bahrain and went to Qatar where they were settled at Ummul- al-Ma^ 'which (he stated) is one of the ports belonging to our State Zubarah', by the Shaikh of Qatar. The Political Resident objected to the expressions 'our State Zubarah and I 'our port' used by the Shaikh and he withdrew them. The Political Agent regarded this act of the Shaikh of Qatar's as unfriendly towards Bahrain and asked him to move the Al- Bu-Romaih. This the Shaikh of Qatar refused to do. For various reasons the case was delayed and a final reply stating c that the Shaikh of Qatar was within his rights in his atti tude was not sent to the Shaikh of Bahrain until May, 1948. 2. After the Political Resident's visit to Zubarah in January, 1947, the Shaikh was again told (P.A.'s letter No. C/206, dated the 16th February, 1947) that the 1944 agreement did not ne an that everything is to be restored in Zubarah as it was in 1936, but that there shall be no innovation after the signing of the agreement. He was further told that there would appear to be nothing to substantiate the allegation that the Shaikh of Qatar was not observing his side of the agree ment. 3. In October, 1947, the Shaikh of Bahrain complained that the Shaikh of Qatar had visited Zubarah without informing fctiai him about it and that he was about to cultivate at Lish and Hiliwan (really only places where there are small cultivable depressions where water collects) 'where our houses are and which are our property'. He was told that the Ruler of Qatar is under no obligation to refrain from visiting Zubarah; nor to inform him when he does so.kC ! w -2- 4. In January, 1948, the Shaikh stated that the Shaikh of Qatar had cultivated at Lish and Hiliwan and was using the wells there. He again quoted his interpretation of the 'status quo in Zubarah' clause in the Agreement and stated that the cultivation was a breach of this clause (here it should be noted that the Shaikh of Bahrain claims rights under the Agreement in what he calls the 'Zubarah Area 1 ' as shown in the map of Zubarah which he has sent with his last letter; while the Shaikh of Qatar has never admitted that the Agree ment covered more than Zubarah itself - indeed the word ti ti was specifically excluded from the Agreement by the Shaikh of Qatar). 5. In February the Shaikh asked whether the Political Resident was 'going to make any decision regarding the dispute between Bahrain aid Qatar' and'whether or not the matter is going to be dealt with'. The Political Resident granted the Shaikh an interview in which he claimed for himself and his subjects private property in the 'Zubarah Area'. The Political Resident asked him to submit a clear statement of the property and privileges whichhe claimed. p-11^ A copy of the translation of his letter No.448, dated the 2nd March, 1948, is attached. /The position regarding it is as 3.5'/ / stated in my D.O.No.C/421, dated the 27th April, 1948. A reply is expected from Qatar shortly. At the same time (in March, 1948), four other complaints were made by the Shaikh of Bahrain viz. (1) one of his subjects was fishing off the Qatar coast when oneof the Qataris destroyed his nets. The Shaikh of Qatar denied this and contrasted the treatment of Bahrain fishermen in Qatar with Qatar fishermen in Bahrain. ^ (2) The Shaikh of Bahrain forwarded a letter from a number of his subjects complaining that the Shaikh of Qatar had deprived them of their houses, fish-traps, and stone fish- traps, in the territory of Zubarah. The Shaikh of Qatarmti • n -3- denied this and stated that the petitioners had fled from Qatar (presumably at the time of the disturbances early in 1936) and were allowed to take with them what they could move. (3) At the instigation of the Shaikh of Bahrain, some others of his subjects complained that the Shaikh of Qatar had deprived them of their fish traps in the waters of 'Zubaeah Area', the Shaikh of Qatar replied similarly that these fisher- v men had fled from Qatar. The Shaikh of Bahrain was apprised of the result of the reference of these complaints to the Shaikh of Qatar. He wrote.contentious letters repeating his previous claims. - — —Translation of letter No.448, dated the 2nd March, 1948, from His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain. wS After Compliments: I have the honour to draw your attention to our meeting with the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 17th February, 1948, during which Your Excellency and our Adviser were present when we discussed the question of our and our subjects' rights in the territory of Zubarah in Qatar Peninsula: I pointed out that during the last ten years the Shaikh of Qatar possessed himself of all our property there and introduced many innovations. As you asked us to furnish details of our pro perty and the property of our subjects in Zubarah, we give below some details pertaining to the places and other things belonging to us. We cannot adduce conclusive praiafxproofs as you did not agree to our proposal to send our men to take photographs of the places and the buildings. Further, in many cases the Shaikh of Qatar destroyed and pulled down the buildings which had been possessed by our relations and subjects before the dispute between Qatar and Bahrain rose. 1: There is the Zubarah territory which was built by our fore fathers and in which exist the graves of our forefathers as well as those of 6 Shaikhs of the ruling family who were entombed near the Qal'at (castle). There are the mosques in Zubarah which were built by the Al-Khalifah, the wells, the walls of the Qal'at and the other houses extending from the ^al'at to the beach. On the beach there are the fish-traps which belong to our subjects and which were being exploited by them until the commencement of the hostilities. These fish traps which are of different kinds, are the property of our subjects - to name some of them - the Al-Bin-Ali of Muharraq and the Al-Ka'ban and others, who are residing in Halat- Um-Al-Baidh. 2: The houses which are in Mirair where fish traps are erected too. At Um-Al-Ma' there are fish traps and houses which until recently some belonged to us and some to our relations. There are also the houses belonging to the Al-Mutawwa' and their families who are our subjects and who are at present living in Bahrain. 3. There are the houses and the wells in Lisha 1 which belong to us and which were built and dwelt in by our people; Fadhil bin Muhanna Ni'aimi was living there until the outbreak of the distur bances. 4: At Um-Al-Ma 1 , Rubaijah and Furaihat there are Hadhrat (fish traps) and Masakirs (fish traps built of stone) the right of ownership of which vests in our subjects, who inherited them - son from father. 6: We are the rigltful owners of the wells which are in Zubarah, Lisha 1 , Halwan and in Masikah; they were dug out and utilised by us for land cultivation. All these places are known to all the Arabs both in Bahrain and Qatar and ve do not believe that there is anybody who denies their having been in our possession before the dispute. Some of our relations resided in these places and erected fish traps as they did during the time the Al-Khalifah were living in Zubarah. Before this dispute we had not been noticing any interference on the part of the Shaikh of Qatar and we as well as our subjects, had been faring across between Bahrain and Zubarah with complete freedom, and without any obstacle rising in our way. Nor had ever been any dispute over our rights before this incident - when we wanted men in Bahrain we used to fetch them from Zubarah. Those who lived in Zubarah were subjectsubject to our rule. We and our subjects used to travel between Bahrain and Zubarah with full freedom and every year we used to send our cattle to Zubarah for grazing there without any tax or demurrage being levied or permission being obtained for going or coming, the reason being that for a hundred and odd years the Al-Khalifah ruled over Zubarah and Bahrain. i/Ve on our part did not cause any harm to the Shaikh of Qatar sdt and his subjects. ■ . . 6^8 e^cSL ; W. C-^S' 6: We respected ind complied with the terms of the agreement we agreed upon through His Excellency the Political Agent and which we signed on the 23rd June, 1944, after it had been signed by the Shaikh of Qatar. But the Shaikh of Qatar has not fulfilled his obligation. 7: We acted according to the agreement; but the Ruler of Qatar did not care for it; and we made complaints to you in this respect. you can, We therefore request you to settle this case as soon as t Usual ending.n To His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Bahrain. 4.^ After Compliments: I have the honour to ack/iowledge the receipt of Your Highness 1 letter dated the 24th June, 1948, on the subject of Zubarah and to reply as follows: It has been pointed out repeatedly to Your Highness by His Excellency the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrain that the 1944 Agreement is obscure in its meaning and accordingly most difficult to enforce. It has been no pleasure for these officers to hear Your Highness 1 complaints year after year, to have the subject of Zubarah introduced on every occasion, and to have it used as a foil to any suggestion from them regarding the better ment of your State. At all times and at very great length both verbally and in writing Your Highness 1 complaints and arguments have been listened to and replied to. Although they have been repeated and replied to in the same way again and again, in order however that there should be no possibility of doubt as to my view in this matter, I must reneat to Your Highness what has been so often said and written by His Majesty's Representatives at Bahrain namely that it is not clear that the Agreement in 1944 stipulated that the position in Zubarah would revert to that existing previous to 1936; nor indeed is it clear that the Agreement in- ramm—fcn 3 -h. so far as it related to Zubarah referred to anything but the remains of the town of Zubarah, and not to any area such as shown in the map forwarded by Your Highness with your letter. The first sentence of the Agreement is also so vague that anything or nothing can be read into it. Four years 1 experience and the efforts of successive Political Residents and Political Agents have not even resulted in any agreed interpretation of the Agreement apart at all from any question of carrying it out. In the circumstances I feel it incumbent on me to state that either Your Highness or His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar is at liberty to rescind the Agreement. Here I must remark that Your Highness 1 refusal to g^ant justice to Qatari subjects in the Bahrain Courts seems hardly consistent with your own interpretation of the Agreement. I note however from paragraph 9 (b) of Your Highness 1 letter that the rights claimed in Zubarah are only private ones and should you wish them further examined it will be neces sary for Your Highness to give a clear state ment recognising His Excellency the Shaikh of Qatar's sovereign rights in the area shown by you on the map enclosed in the same way as they already exist in the rest of the Qatar peninsula. These sovereign rights of course imply rights to levy customs duties and indeed to exercise all other rights of any sovereign in any country.The relevance of Your Highness' remarks as to the State of Qatar (made in para graph 6 of your letter) and as to the progress- iveness of your own State (made in paragraph 7) to your claims to Zubarah is not clear. These claims have to be judged with regard to the rights of the Shaikh of Qatar of whom His Majesty's Government is also the protector. They are judged according to the principles of justice though it is well known that to be just according to those principles involves compro mise and often results pleasing to neither party. ihey are not to be bargained for reforms in the State or set aside because of backwardness; but if this w ere the case, Your Highness' consistent refusal of the Political Authorities' request to reform the. administra tion of your State (which has remained subs tantially unchanged for 20 years) would hardly be in your favour. Your Highness has my sympathy when you state that your honour has been affected because of the Zubarah case; but it seems worth reflecting whether it becomes a ruler of Your Highness' status continuously to complain about your alleged rights in an arid piece of desert,^broken down houses, fish traps, and small wells. Again, the relevance of your remarks as to boundaries in paragraph 10 is not apparent, but if Your Highness refers to His Majesty's Government's decision in the matter of the di- i vision of the sea-bed between Bahrain and Qatar, then your attitude towards such a decision-4- is regrettably unlike that of other Rulers in the Gulf and indeed, as I understand it, * $ is hardly inconsonant with tne tradition of Your Highness 1 ancestors.

IU/-iSLo- CQNFIDFNTIAL w PEKFIIAW GULF PESIDFKCY (l^/g43) the 14th July 1948 Sir i In continuation of ray despatch No.10^ (19/243) of the 1st July 1948. .. q I have the honour to forward herewith a note prepared by Mr. Pelly the Political Agent, Bahrain bringing the history of the Zubarah dispute up to date. It is accompanied by a translation of a letter received from the Shaikh of Bahrain defining his private rights in Zubarah. I also enclose for ready reference a copy of the 1944 Agreement between the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar, ^ \ol: C-95' 3* It will be seen from the last paragraph of the Shaikh of Bahrain^ representation forwarded to you with my despatch under reference that his main request is that the Shaikh of Qatar should be compelled to carry out the 1P44 Agreement. Unfortunately this agreement js extremely vague. The Shaikh of Pahrain claims that under it everything should revert to the position that existed prior to 1936 and that the term 'Zubarah' covers a large area in addition to the town of Zubarah itsel^. The Shaikh of Qatar claims that the agreement only provides that nothirf new should be done in Zubarah subsequent to its date and that 'Zubarah' means Zubarah town only. On a strict interpret ation of the letter of the agreement It is difficult to read Into it more than the Shaikh of Qatar does, and there was little doubt when he signed it he did not intend to concede anything else. . The Shaikh of Bahrain is at liberty if he wishes, to repudiate the agreement on the grounds that he signed it under a misapprehension of its meaning but has refrained from doing this no doubt because it Is the only document he possesses which implies any recognition by Government Officers of anv right of his in Zubarah. 4. The salient points of the case are as followsi His Majesty's Government have never recognised any right of the Shaikh of Bahrain to interfere as sovereign in the Qatar peninsula, and successive Pulers have been Informed to this effect from 1876 onwards. On the other hand treaty relations with Shaikh Abdullah as Ruler of Qatar date from 1916 • he had previously been sub.lect to the Turks - and in the map attached to the oil concession agreement which he entered into with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited under our auspices in 1935 his territories are shown as embracing the whole of the Qatar peninsula down to a specified southern boundary (c.f. Article 2 of the Agreement). There is no doubt, however, that up to 1936, members of the Al- Khalifah family and subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain used to visit Zubarah freely for recreation, grazing, fishing, etc., without any interference by the Shaikh of Qatar. In particular, nomad tribesmen used to cross freely between Bahrain and Qatar, acknowledging allegiance to the Shaikh of Bahrain or the Shaikh of Qatar, as suited their convenience. It was trouble given by some of these nomads that induced the Shaikh of Qatar to assert his authority over Zubarah in 1936. From then onwards a state of blockade existed between Bahrain and Qatar, until it was terminated by the agreement of 1944. /6. The A1 Khalifah.•. The Pt. Hon. Ernest Bevln, M.P., etc. etc. etc..

As lonr aro as 1919 In the time of Shaikh Xsa, Shaikh Abdullah, the uncle of the present Shaikh, made a representation In London on the subject vide India Office letter No.P«6649 dated 16th September 1919 to the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad* With Shaikh Salman, the matter has become a mania and any representation made to him on almost any subject, and especially on that of Internal reforms Is met with the reply 'I cannot do anything until I obtain my rights In Zubarah* • , Sle^- 6. It will be noted that In the present application, he specifically renounces any claim to sovereignty. This Is some thing gained. He demands, however, his private rights and, for the first time, has defined, though very vaguely, on a map, the area within which he claims these rights. His claims as set forth in his letter of the Snd March 1948 are indefinite and supported by no documentary evidence; it is doubtful if any of them would be sustainable in a court of law, and I do not think the present Shaikh of Qatar will willingly concede any of them. 7. I have been tempted from time to time to tell the Shaikh that we refuse to recognise any rights of his, private or other- ' wise in Zubarah and that he can repudiate the 1944 Agreement If he wishes. I am not, however, in favour of this course because it would certainly not stop him from pressing his claim, it would embitter his relations with His Majesty's Government with whom he has up to date been very friendly and co-operative, and he might take steps which would directly or indirectly hamper the operations of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar. r ycept for the effect it might have on these operations, the re-introduction of a blockade of Qatar by the Shaikh of Bahrain would not do much harm. Very few Qatarls are employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company or otherwise in Bahrain and the peninsula could always obtain its supplies in Dubai instead of Bahrain. Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited however, would be severely handi capped if they were unable to import their requirements and parti cularly, water, through or from Bahrain. T have suggested to Mr. Lermltte, the loCal Manager of the Company, that as soon as they open their own port in Qatar, they should, in view of the bad relations between Bahrain and Qatar, transfer their H#»ad Office to the peninsula, but I understand this Is not their policy at present. In any case the water difficulty will remain. , '''n/cX • 8. My view is therefore that we should continue tp temporise and endeavour to reach some modus viven^l between Bahrain and Qatar c.f. my despatch to the India Office, No.C/767 of the S6th August 1946. Shaikh Hamad heir-apparent of Shaikh Abdullah of Qatar, who more or less ruled the State on his fathers behalf and was strongly opposed to making any concession to Shaikh Salman has recently died. Shaikh Abdullah who Is also unlikely to concede anything, is over 80 and in bad health. It is possible that when he dies, his successor may be less embittered personally against the A1 Khallfah and may be willing to concede somethinr which will serve as a face-saver for Shaikh Salman. T admit I h have only a faint hope of this, but I consider it better to attempt something of this sort rather than to tell Shaikh Salman that we can do nothing for him, which, amongst other things, may result in his appealing to the Arab League as he has already threatened to do. Another possible course which I have In mind if the Shaikh of Qatar could be brought to agree to do, would be the appointment of a Government Officer, preferably one who has never served in the Gulf, as an arbitrator. This procedure however would be expensive and might lead us nowhere. 9. I have the following comments to make on specific points mentioned in the representation!^ , pI 1^, , :,■! . 3 - Paragraph 2» It cannot possibly be said that the 1944 Agreement admitted the A1 Khalifats rights and predominance In the Zubarah area. It does, however, recognise that the A1 Khallfah have some interest in Zubarah itself• ESJJtelMXh-S* This paragraph contains a threat to Impose sanctions against Qatar* It is doubtful If anythlnr Is intended beyond the kind of blockade that existed until the end of 1944. If stronger action were taken, it would be n-cesaury for His Majesty^ Government to Interfere. Paragraph 6 . It is tru^ that the administration of Qatar is very backward, but this point is irrelevant. Paragraph 7 . No reforms have been introduced in Bahrain for the last 20 years and any suggestions for the improvement of the administration are met with the reply that nothing can be done ^ until the Zubarah case is settled. It Is true that the Shaikh has given reasonable assistance to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited. Bahrain subjects are at liberty to visit Qatar whenever they wish, provided they comply with the local laws. The Shaikh of ^atar has also stated that he is willing to welcome any of the A1 Khalifah at Zubarah, but as his quests «nd not as landlords. There Is no doubt that interested persons for their own ends have taunted the Shaikh with his Inability to obtain a favourable decision from His Majesty^ Government retrardini^ Zubarah. Paragraph 9. (c) There is no question of the Shaikh of Bahrain surrendering oil rights in the Zubarah area, as he has never been recognised as having s&gt;ny, and, as he points nut, has never claimed any. (d) The Shaikh of Bahrain Is not a party to the oil concession agreement between the Shaikh of Qatar and w essrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited and is not concerned with Its provi slons. (e) So far as I am aware, the Bahrain Petroleum Company have never made any claim to Zubarah and such a claim could only arise if the sovereignty of th^ Shaikh of Bahrain over Zubarah were recognised. (f) This contains both a threat and a bribe. If the Shaikh of Bahrain were seriously to interfere with the operations of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited we should have,to inter vene drastically. It is desirable, however, thet the Company should reduce their dependence on Bahrain to a minimum. N Paragraph 10 . The question of the sea boundaries is Irrelevant. The language used by the Shaikh is discourteous and his 'firm refusal' to accept a formal decision made by His Majesty 1 Government does not accord with his past behaviour and th!?t of his predecessors. 10. With regard to the reply to be sent to the representation, I have attempted a draft. My general idea Is thst It should be as sympathetic as possible, that It should avoid discussion of details ? and that it should leave the situation much as it stands now. I cannot pretend that the reply will satisfy the Shaikh and consider It likely that he will return to the charge. I have the honour to be Sir With great truth and respect. Your most obedient, humble Servant, (///L a f ■ • LB 1My dear Friend, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Highness letter of the 24th June 1948 on the subject of Zubarah and to reply as follows: 2* I have personally studied the history of this case and know how deeply your Highness feels about It. I cannot, however, refrain ^rom pointing out that repeatedly over many years, you and your predecessors have been Informed that His Majesty's Government could not recognise any right of the Huler of Bahrain to interfere on the mainland, and, in particular, that his claims to Zubarah could not be supported. I am glad to see that your Highness, in the letter that you have addressed to me, hcs specifically renounced any claim to sovereignty over Zubarah. You allege that the Shaikh of Qatar is not carrying out the agreement which he made with you in 1944 through the good offices of H.B.M* s Political Agent and ask that he should be I ■ B I ' compelled to do so. From the reports I have received on this subject it would appear that your Highness and the Shaikh of Qatar each interpret the agreement in a different manner, that the agreement is so worded that it is difficult to say which inter pretation is correct and that it is not clear that the Shaikh of Qatar has broken the agreement according to his interpretation of it. Though in these circumstances it is difficult to charge him with a breach of the agreement I am naturally disturbed that bad relations should exist between two such loyal friends of the British Government as your Highness and Shaikh Abdullah, and am most anxious that the dispute between you should be settled in an amicable manner. I am accordingly instructing my officers to do everything they can with this object in view. At the same time I would point out that your Highness and Shaikh Abdullah are both equally entitled to His Majesty's Government 1 s protection and that His Majesty's Government cannot favour one as against the other. In particular the sovereignty of th^ A1 Thani family over the whole of the Qatar peninsula has been recognised for many years by His Majesty's Government and Shaikh Abdullah Vcannot be expected to concede «ny rights which would detrsct frorr th?t sovereignty. If f however, your Richness or your fubjectf can prove that you have any definite private rlfhts In Zubarah or Its neighbourhood, T am sure my officers in the Gulf will do their best to persuade the Shaikh of Qatar to recognise them. Before concludlnf f T cannot refrain from eypresslnr some / surprise at the language used by your Highness In the ICth para graph of your letter. Your attitude towards His Majesty^ Government's decision on the boundary of the sea bed between Qatar and Bahrain Is regrettably unlike that of other Pulers in the Culf in slnnilar c&amp;8eS| and ?s hard' , y In consonance with your own past attitude to His Majesty's Government and with the tradition of your ancestors.—i COKFID^STIAT, .

I have the honour to draw your attention to our meeting with the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 17fch February, 1948, during which Your Excellency and our ad viser were present when we discussed the question of our and our subjects 1 rights in the territory of Zubarah in Qatar Peninsula. I pointed out that during the last ten years the Shaikh of Qatar possessed himself of all our property there and introduced many innovations. As you asked us to furnish details of our property and the property of our subjects in Zubarah, we give below some details pertaining to the places and other things belonging to us. We cannot adduce conclusive proofs as you did not agree to our proposal to send our men to take photographs of the places and the buildings. Further in many cases the Shaikh of Qatar destroyed and pulled down the buildings which had been possessed by our relations and subjects before the dispute between Qatar and Bahrain rose. 1: There is the Zubarah territory which was built by our forefatheB and in which exist the graves of our forefathers as well as those of 6 Shaikhsof the ruling family who were entombed near the Qal^t and the other houses extending from the Qal f at to the beach. On the beach there are the fish-traps which belong to our subjects and which were being exploited by them until the commencement of the hostilities. These fish- traps which are of different kinds, are the property of our subjects - to name some of Lhem - the Al-Bin-Ali of Muharraq and the Al-Ka'ban and others, who are residing in Halat-Um- Al-Baidh. 2: The houses which are in Mirair where fish-traps are erected too. At Um-Al-Ma 1 there are fish-traps and houses which until recently some belonged to us and some to our relations. There are also the houses belonging to the Al- Mutawwa 1 and their families who are our subjects and who are at present living in Bahrain. 3: There are the houses and the wells in Lisha 1 which belong to us and which were built and Hi dwelt in by our people; Fadhil bin Muhanna N^aimi was living there until the outbreak of the distumbances. 4: At Um-Al-Ma', Rubaijah and Furaihat there are Hadhrat (fish-traps) and Masakirs (fish-traps built of stone) the right of ownership of which vests in our subjects, who inherited them - son from father.-2- IP Mi v S v t- e ? re the r:L g htful owners of the wells which are In an^ a nf?ii L Hbs 1 ' Ha ^ wan and in Maslkah; they were dug out and utilised by us for land cultivation. .

Your Excellency has already forwarded me such peculiar allegations to which I sent a detailed reply (my letter dated the 28th Jamadah Awwal, 1367 refers) and proved to Your Excel lency the groundlessness of these allegations and their lack of authenticity from all angles. It appears that His Highness has not had his consciousness fully matured to perceive the developments which happenings during the past long years . have brought about. In his claims he always goes back to hundreds of years past without knowing what happened afterwards, or realising the present situation. This line of reasoning he should apply in his case; for Bahrain is not - in all respect - the same as it was during the past years. Your Excellency might remember when you visited Duha on the 20th April that I spoke to Your Excellency about the condition of Zubarah in the past, how it had since become uninhabited and ruined and how it had remained so i.e. in the same condition as when Your Excellency saw it on the 22nd April. Your Excellency must have studied the conditions ^s described to you by me and got to know the position there. From the atove you will see that the allegations of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain are not based on facts or logical reasoning and are not justifiable mentally. le therefore request Your Excellency not to lend such statements any of your attention, as we have no further reply to give to such statements made by the Shaikh of Bahrain without their being justified.

I cannot, however, refrain from pointing out that repeatedly over many years, you and your predecessors have been Informed that His Majesty^ Government could not recognise any right of the Fuler of Bahrain to Interfere on the mainland, and, In particular, that his claims to Zubarah could not be supported. I am glad to see that your Highness, In the letter that you have addressed to me, has. specifically renounced any claim to sovereignty over Zubarah. 3* You allege that the Shaikh of Qatar Is not carrying out the agreement which he made with you In 1944 through the good offices of H.B.WMs Political Agent and ask that he should be compelled to do so. From the reports I have received on this subject It would appear that your Highness and the Shaikh of Qatar each Interpret the agreement In a different manner, that the agreement Is so worded that It ^.s difficult to say which Inter- pretatlon Is correct and that It Is not clear that the Shaikh of Qatar has broken the agreement according to his Interpretation of V , it. Though In these circumstances It Is difficult to charge him with a breach of the agreement I am naturally disturbed that bad relations should exist between two such loyal friends of the British Government as your Highness and Shaikh Abdullah, and am most anxious that the dispute between you should be settled In an amicable manner.

In view, however, of Your Highness's clearly expressed desires in this matter, I am willing to instruct my officers to use their good offices on Your Highness f s behalf in an endeavour to negotiate a private agreement whereby the Sheikh of Qatar would extend to Your HighneBB and the members of Your Highness's family, the free right to visit the ruins of Zubareh, though not to inhabit them or undertake any work of construction or demolition. I must, however, make it clear that in any such matter H.M-O. must regard the Sheikh of Qatar as having the full right to refuse such an agreement or in the event of his acceptance, to impose such conditions or consideration as he may deem appropriate. 4. Before concluding, I cannot refrain from expressing some surprise at the language used by Your Highness in the tenth paragraph of your letter. Your attitude towards His Majesty's Government's decision on the boundary of the sea bed between Qatar and Bahrain is regrettably unlike that of other Rulers in the Gulf x in similar cases, and is hardly in consonance with your own past attitude to His Majesty's Government and with the tradition of your ancestors.I COHFIDENTTAT, Wo.B/ 2-7^(19/24^^ PFPSIAN G TT LF HFSIDFNCY PAHPAIN the 12th August 1948 c ^ • y Reference Sir Rupert's semi-official letter No.C/49 (19/243) of the 4th July about Zubarah. ^ 2 * 1 enclose a copy of Clinton -Thomas » letter No.CF 9804/276/91) of the 4th August and of its enclosure.

POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIfJ, Dated 16th August, 1948 The main observation which 1/ have to make on the draft enclosed with your D.0.No,B/279, dated the 12th August, 1948, is that it is absolutely vain to expect that we can 'negotiate a private agreement whereby the Shaikh of Qatar would extend to Your Highness and the members of Your Highness 1 family the free right to visit the ruins of Zubarah, though not to inhabit them'; and any attempt to negotiate for this will only lead to further misunderstanding and further bitterness. 2.^- This opinion may seem to conflict with that \ implied in paragraph 4 of the draft forwarded with my D.O.No.C/R-92, dated the 29th June, 1948, to Sir Rupert Hay, in which I at least suggested a loop hole for further examination of Bahrain's alleged 'private rights'. I had not then however had the final evidence of the hardness of the Qatar attitude forwarded by the Shaikh of Qatar's letter, a copy of which was forwarded to you with Agency Printed Letter No.C/R-1287^dated the 28th July, 1948. 3. As I see it, the only thing to do now is to inform the Shaikh of Bahrain, as I have already suggested several times, that he is at liberty to repudiate the 1944 / 'Agreement' and to tell him that the Ruler of Qatar, as sovereign His Excellency Lt. Col. A.C. Galloway, CIE, OBE, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.

I have been asked for my observations on the revised draft reply to the Shaikh of Bahrain, which it 7 is proposed to submit to higher authority for final approval. The Shaikh of Qatar has verbally informed Hay and Pelly, vide Hay^ note of the 6th January 1948, copy attached, that his country was at the disposal of the A1 Khalifah for hawking visits. In writing he has stated 'in regard to Shaikh Salman's servants and men (should they wish to visit Qatar for recreation and hunting) to receive them in the proper manner as necessitated by the duties of friendship'. I enclose copies of correspondence on the subject. The Shaikh of Bahrain is at liberty to act on this whenever he likes and I do not think we should go further v to obtain another 11 agreement' on this point. t In any case if the Secretary of State were to ar&gt;k the local officers to negotiate a 'private^agreement. the Shaikh of Bahrain, and possibly the Shaikh of Qatar, would consider this official, coming from shch a quarter. You will see from the. enclosure to my despatch No# 130 (19/243) of the 6th August 1948, the Shaikh of Qatar 1 s attitude, and in my opinion our chances of success, with which Pelly agrees, would be nil. We should be placed in an impossible position while the Shaikh of Bahrain would have further grounds of complaint that the local officers were failing to carry out His Majesty's Governmentls instructions issued on his behalf. My further remark is that, in my opinion we should be done with temporising and finally dispose of the A1 Xhalifah's claim to Zubarah. Our last opportunity to do this was in 1937 (vide Residency telegram*No. 680 of the 4th July 1937 to the late India Office), but it was not taken with the result that the Shaikh of Bahrain has achieved an agreement which he considers official, and adopted the refractory language used in his paragraph 10. f.jSl 1:-7a Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 28th August 1948. .B.

With regard to (a) I feel it would be a mistake to take any'action against the Shaikh of ;atar to eniorce the removal of the Ar Rumaih as it would amount to a formal recognition of the Shaiku of Bahrain's right to inter! ere in the Qatar peninsula. The most we can do is to express our displeasure at tiis refusal to take a.ction which would aeip to maintain good relations between him and Bahrain and possibly to v^uote his refusal at some time in the future as a reason ior our not complying with some request which he may make to us. With regard to (b) I think i^possiblp we want to 51 avoid abstract arguments with the Shaikh about his 'privileges' and this is one of the reasons why I have not asked i or further 5052 particulars of the 'title deeda' referred to in his letter at page 4'. notice that Colonel Galloway in his letter an extract of which is given at page 67 merely says 'it is agreed that some of your people had privileges in qatar H and there is no admission by lib that tney stilJ have them. The privileges if they do exist probably amount to nothing i-ihan ttve right of some Bakrain tribosmen. to visit ^ataj to graze their animals and collect gacn.j I think the best line to take with the Shaikh is to tell him that if any bi his triDesmcin are on any particular occasion retusea privileges to wnich he considers them entitled he should K * rei er tue matter to us ana ^we will use our good offices with the Shaikh of ^atar if we have reason to believe that he has not been aciding by his agreement these privileges should continue.
