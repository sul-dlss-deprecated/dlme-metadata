H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum ; Until 31st March 1944 the drivers of American Transport Command vehicles crossing Shaikh Hamad Bridge paid tolls in cash. On 30th March the A.T.C. sent to the State Engineer a list of 19 vehicles and expressed a wish to pay the toll in the same way as is done by the Royal Air Force viz., 15/- p.m. for a small car and 30/- for each large truck irrespective of the number of times the vehicles use the bridge. A bill, for April, amounting to Rs.420/- was issued from the Electric Office to the A.T.C. covering the cars mentioned in their list. This bill has not been paid. The State Engineer asked for sylist of vehicles i using the bridge during May, but this has not been obtained, I believe the number of vehicles is liable to increase. I should be grateful if.you could put the matter to the authorities concerned and request a settlement. /U Adviser to the G-overnment. x © YG.No. 2157-36/61 POLITICAL AGTNCY, BAHHAIN.

It was agreed that it was desired to avoid the question of single payments for each crossing on account of administrative and accounting difficulties likely to be experienced, both by the Bahrein authorities and the R.A.F, A flat rate of Rs.1,000 a month to cover the passage of all R.A.F. cars for all crossings over the causeway was suggested to the State Adviser, such monthly payment to be subject to periodical review, at intervals of 3 or 6 months if desired. osition and he thought that he could recommend its acceptance with effect from the commencement of the new Arabic year, a An examination of. the M.T. record in respect of It was represented* to the State Adviser that Sep- The State Adviser said that this seemed a fair prop-V matter of a few days hence.

No. Of 1364 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 7th R/A;^al, 1364 February 19, 1945. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Bsquire, C.B.E. I have the honour to refer to your letter No.588- 6/36 dated 12th February 1945. When I v/as visited by the R.A.F. representatives I had had no opportunity of examining the figures relating to R.A.F. vehicles and I informed them that whatever I said was subject to what might appear after I had discussed the matter with the State Engineer who deals with this matter. 2. The arrangement which is now in force was agreed upon by the R.A.F. as it apparently suited them and as far as the Bahrain Government is concerned it appears to be equitable. 3. The Bahrain Government is not prepared to accept a payment of im.1,000/- per month on account of all R.A.F. vehicles using the Manama-Muharraq causeway and the Shaikh Hamad Bridge. In this connection I assume that 'Sitra” in the R.A.F. letter enclosed in yours should read 'Manama”. 4. The Bahrain Government is willing to provide books of tickets at the normal rate, for all types of vehicles, which can be used by drivers of R.A.F. vehicles. This would obviate tne need for any cash transactions at the gate and would ensure that the R.A.F. did not pay for more crossings than they actually made. Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To His Britannic Majesty T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir2 5. As an alternative the Bahrain Government is willing to accept from the R.A.F. an account at the end of each month showing the vehicles of different types which have used the bridge with the number of actual journeys made by each vehicle. I understand that all drivers keep log books so it would be possible to keep a record of crossings. The charge would then be assessed according to the standard basic rates. This method would not necessitate the use of tickets thoughit it might be necessary to increase the bridge personnel should a check be desirable. 6. If the R.A.F. could exercise a more efficient system of control to ensure that each vehicle makes the maximum possible number of trips accross the bridge the amount of bridge tolls could be considerably reduced. At present, for example, if 10 journeys are made separately by each of 10 vehicles (100 journeys) the charge on the monthly season ticket rate would be 10 x 30 300/-, if however 100 journeys were made by 2 vehicles (50 journeys each) the charge would be 2 x 301= 60/-. 7. Bridge tolls are collected in order to provide a fund for maintaining the bridge and also to cover depre ciation on the bridge. The large numbers of heavy military vehicles which are now crossing the bridge have a direct bearing upon the rate of fatigue caused by stress set up by the weight of traffic supported by the bridge structure. This is apart from the wear and tear on the roads, especially within the Muharraq Municipality area, which is caused by military heavy traffic. Vehicles which are not military pay vehicle taxes and this contributes towards the cost of the upkeep of roads, a proportion of this revenue is paid to the two Municipalities for their share in road work but in 2 /— ^ j 2,fact at the present time military vehicles are using the town roads and the causeway more than civilian traffic.

The Bahrain Government suggest either that they should provide books of tickets for all types of vehicles which can be used by drivers of Royal Air Force vehicles and would obviate the need for any cash transaction at the gate or that payment should be made in accordance with a monthly account to be main tained by the Royal Air Force showing the vehicles of different types which had used the bridge with the number of journeys performed by each vehicle.

Sir, / 1 have the honour to refer to your letter No. 2707-6/86 dated 1st July 1945, regarding toll charges paid by the R.A.F. on the Shaikh Hamad Bridge. 2. In my letter No.472-31 dated 19th February 1945, l suggested alternative methods of payment of bridge tolls which in my opinion were not un reasonable. If either of the methods referred to in para 4 or para 5 of my letter were accepted the R.A.F. would only pay tolls for vehicles actually using the bridge. The ^.1,000/- which the R.A.F. suggested that they should pay covers only 13/ of the 107^Havy vehicles now in use. 3. Last month toll charges were charged for three 10-ton lorries, 103, 3-ton lorries and one lg-ton lorry, and another 31 assorted vehicles. The cost for these heavy vehicles on season ticket rates was Is.3,210/- an average of xm.30/- per vehicle. This, at standard daily rates, represents only lg trips per day per vehicle which, from the R.A.F. point of view, appears to be economical as I believe many of the vehicles make many more than trips daily. 4. I again suggest that the R.A.F. should adopt the method of using tickets if the present system, which was introduced at the request of the R.a'.F., does not now suit them. Failing this the Bahrain Government would be willing to agree to a monthly payment of m.3,000/-, to be reduced proportionately as the number of vehicles diminished.

The otate Engineer has made an enquiry into the complaint and report* to me as follows:- ’’Regarding the complaint that toll payers have had to operate the boom winch gear after payment of the approved fee, I have been unable to obtain corroboration from the bridge per sonnel. The bridge operator’s hours of duty and.12.0 a.m. daily. If he is required to operate the bridge out of these hours he has to be sent for from his house which is close to the Manama Toll House. It is quite possible therefore that the complaint in question refers to some incident which arose in his absence, and if such is the case, the passage of the boats under the bridge was un authorised although the appropriate fee of m.5/- may have been paid to the bridge Toll Keeper.”' are between S.O A.M. and 12.0 p.m. and 9.0 p.m. Adviser to the Government.

Reference your memorandum No.1030-23 S.F. dated the 15th May, 1946. 2. Will you please confirm that small fishing boats, without masts, are allowed to pass free of charge under the bridge, even when it is closed for boat traffic? 3. If this is so, is there any reason why small motor launches without masts, and of similarly shallow draught, should not be allowed the same concession? Since there Is no question of the bridge being raised for their bene^i^t, or of their passage having any effect on the wear anc tear of the bridge, there seeais to be no justi fication for any charge in the case of such craft. for Political Agent, Bahrain■* No.1726-6/86.

H. 3. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - Ah. '-•A Reference your memorandum No. 1648-6/86 dated 25th May 1946. Small fishing boats without masts which can pass through the water channels under the bridge, v;ithout requiring the chain booms to be lowered, may do so free of charge. They are not likely to damage the caisson or fenders and are hand propelled. Motor launches do not come under this category as they are not engaged in fishing and they require the booms to be lowered on account of their draught. If there are motor launches of shallow enough draught not to require the booms lowering they too can be allowed to pass freely.
