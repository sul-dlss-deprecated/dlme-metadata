With the highest respect, Your Grace's most obedient, humble servant, ^ Liout-Ool., political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Majesty^ Consul-General for Pars etc. « His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, K»G«,P«C«,G»C»' •G»,G«C«V.O., Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.I•REPORT ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH SflTED HASHUI,ENVOY OF THE SULTAN OF NEJD, BETWEEN 11th AND 20th OF JUNE 1983« Before I left Kuwait on the 4th of June last, I reoeived telegraphic intimation from the Political Agent, Bahrain, that the Sultan of Nejd had deapatched a trusted enyoy 9 one syed Hashim, to discuss with me matters arising out of the recent troubles at Bahrain in so far as they affected his subjects resident in those m± islands* The political Agent Inquired whether I desired Syed Hashim to follow me on to Kuwait at once or if not, what directions the Political Agent should give ryed Hashim in order that he might have the opportunity of meeting me* 2» I was on the point of leaving Kuwait for a hurried Journey to Mohamnerah and Ahwaz and expected to be back at my Bushire headquarters in the course of the next three or four days® I therefore asked that Syed Hashim should pro ceed forthwith to Bushire and await my arrival there® I also wired to my Secretary at Bushire asking him to make sure that all possible consideration could be shown to His Highness Envoy on arrival pending my return* 3* I returned to Bushire on the evening of the 8th June and had my first interview with Syed Hashim on the morning of Monday, the 11th June® Syed Hashim is a young man, possibly between 30 and 35 years of and of iniw^it origin^ He ie ciosely related to an old friend of mine at Kuwait, shaikh oosi bin bdul Rezak, a welj-to-do and respectable merchant of that town who died a few years ago. syed Hashim informed / me that when I waa nerving at Kuwait he was only a boy but that he remembered me perfectly well coming to shaikh Moosa'a dlwaniyyah on the festlTal of Id and there meeting Shaikh Mubarak as-Subah® 4. With this link between ua the ice thawed at once and I found syed fiaahim polite, capable, ouick of under standing, mindful of his master's intereata and at the aame time-8- time anxious to promote a friendly understanding and maintain good relations* 5» I have prepared a statement attached to this report of the oorrespondenoe covering the negotiations to which I shall he obliged to refer constantly in the course of this report. At the preliminary interview, Syed Hashim presented letters 3,5 and 7, translations of which are duly forwarded and will be found amid the accompaniments to this report* These letters were read and then passed on for careful translation* And I then took the opportunity of raising with the envoy in the course of a general conversation, various matters of interest to the Sultan of Nejd and myself. As I had only Just returned from Kuwait, our conversation turned naturally on the blockade whiah Bin saud has established in hia territories against caravans proceeding from Kuwait to Central Arabia. Finding my hearer sympathetic with the Kuwait point of view, I sketched to him generally my suggestions for a settlement of the disrute. These suggestions are embodied separately in my despatch No* 898-s dated 20th June 19S3 to the Secretary of state for the Colonies, which is being sert to the Government of India separately; and in that despatch I have referred at length to the reply hazarded by syed Hashim as to the possible views of his master on the matt er* in dispute and their settlement* 6* I then turned to the question of the subsidy to his Highness the Sultan of Nejd and the orders of His majesty's Government directing its discontinuance* I was the more impelled to this as during my resent interview with Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah at Ahwaz on the 6th of June, the Shaikh to my embarrassment had himself raised the matter by a blunt and direct/^ question 'Was it really true that Government had stopped Bin Sa'ud's subsidy ? I fenced with the question but with ^very small degree of success* It was evident that the in formationi mm -3- ie information had leaked out somewhere and more than prov able that it was common talk in the bazaars of Mesopotamia and it seemed therefore important to ascertain at once how far it was generally known in Riyadh and whether Bin Sa'ud^ confidential secretary, now talking to me, knew any thing about it* Syed Hashim replied that he had neither information nor instructions on the subject* It had been fad. evident to Major Daly already that Abdullah Qasaibi fail ed to appreciate the situation for when the question of the two instalments of fi 25,000/~ each and their method of pay ment to Bin Sa'ud^ agent at Bahrain came up f6r discussion six weeks ago, Qasaibi had asked 'Why fifty thousand? It ought to be sixty*' At the time Major Daly's lips were sealed* If we are to judge by Syed Hashim and from what we know of Bin sa'ud's open, perhaps rather blustering, charact er, it seemed very likely that he had failed to appreciate the force of Sir Percy Cox^ letter No* S.0./663 dated IPth/ gist April 1923 to his address and would be naturally more incensed than ever should the matter be discussed in the bazaars while he himself remained in ignorance* I accord ingly read sir Percy Oox^s Jitter to the nevoy who at once commented on the word 'con tempi ate' on which emphasis is laid in letter No 1 of the correspondence, and further on the fact that the letter might bear the interpretation that an)/ annual payment of £ 50,000was substituted for tha monthly pay ment of £ 6,000/- The first instalment of £ 85,000/- had already been paid to Abdul Aziz al Qasaibi in Bahrain as elsewhere reported, and it was impossible to suspend pay ment* I therefore drafted and Issued letter No* 1 dated 14th June 1923 from myself to the Sultan of Hejd which I trust will meet with approval* It appears to me to make the matter olear beyond all possible doubt and I only added the general expression 'that Government's clemency was still open' to soften dcm the rather harsh expression 'no further payments can be looked for'. As I was careful to explain to the envoy verbally, this merely meant that-4- (&lt;o S that fresh demands on the liberality of His Majesty's Govern ment would 'be duly considered when they were received. ?• syed Hashim left on the 80th June and during the interval between the 11th and 80th we had constant and extremely friendly interviers. In obedience to telegram No* 858 dated 5th received 6th June from the Secretary of Stete for the Colonieey I had, before Syed Hashim's arrival, drat ted a letter, No • 2 of* the correspondence, infoi? minj? the sultan of Kejd of the recent changes at Bahrain, their purport and the reasons for those changes♦ The letter is little else than an epitome of my general report No. 850-S dated 31st Way 1983 on recent events at Bahrain# Throughout the whole of the correspondence I have endeavoured to bear in mind the directions of the Colonial Office contained in telegram No. 1844 dated 18th May 1983 from the Secretary of Btate for India to my address, enjoining me to observe the utmost consideration and courtesy in my communications with a t-kiiritiGP the Sultan of Fdjd* At the same tims I har e endeavoured to contrive not to sacrifice essentials. 8% The two really important letters from the sultan of N 33 are numbers 5 and 6 of the correspondence. On the whole, considering the ordinary tenour of Bin sand's corr espondence when annoyed, I think we must agree with the esx.irGate formed by the Political Agent, Bahrain, that they are, in the main, a mild remonstrance. Though some of the olains advanced, notably the suggestion that he and I should ap! int fronts to conduct a careful and searching inquiry into a matter on which I after careful consultation with Shaikh Hamad and the Political Agent, Bahrain, the persons primarily responsible for the maintenance of law and order ' 1 n ds, had already issued final orders acting under the instructions of His Majesty's Government, were quite impossible to entertain, they were not difficult to reoly to; and I hope that my letter dated 80th June to the sultan of Nejd, No. 7 of the correspondence, had dealt with all matters raised by the Sultan in a manner that will be found on Mn on examination, unobjectionable* Bin Sa'ud will no doubt, after the manner of all oriental potentates, return to the charge to save his face and not to appear to give way too rapidly, but, as it takes longer to get a reply between Riyadh and Bushlre than it does between Bushire and London, I dare to entertain the hope that affairs will settle them selves while the correspondence drags on. 9. The only really practical matter left undecided is the passport question which has not, I think, before been brought to the notice of His Majesty's Governmai t, although for some months a long triarepilar correspondence has been proceeding between Riyadh, the Persian Gulf wid Iraq. The crux of the whole matter is that the Sultan of Nejd is vain ly endeavouring to escape the inconvenience to his subjects o there being no British Consul in his dominions; and Iraq and India, to which two countries his subjects chiefly tra vel, are inclined to insist on the visa of a British Consul, and the most appropriate Individual to affix that visa is the political Agent,Bahrain. There also possibly lurks in the mind o^ the Sultan anl^ inclination to tighten the strin gs of authority round the necks of his subjects resident in Bahrain# The envoy cited to me the example of His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Damascus who, he alleged, performs all such good offices for Nejda, gratis. I replied tha t I could not challenge his statement and was quite prepared to ac- cept it but that I was quite sure tht, if the British Con sul at Damascus had the misfortune to be stationed at Bahr ain, he would be quite unable to favour the Hejada inthfe way without being exposed to a storm of hostile criticism from foreigners not so favoured* I understand from Major Daly that the visa fee is really quite a trifling matter and goes to pay for the clerks who actually do the extra passport work# A good deal of trouble throughout these negotiations was caused by the very natural desire of Bin Sa^d to see the whole way clear before him in any policy instead o experinonting in individual cases, pointing outmm out concrete instances where hardship is involved and then id . \ , i addressing us with a view to the removal of those grievances# The passport question received an amount of discussion auite disproportionate to its importance* At the close^after my Secretary, who deals with Consular matters, had 'been Wrought in and given his opinion on the questions at issue, I think the envoy really began to appreciate our difficulties in giving favoured treatment ar^. to understand that Nejada were being treated exactly like other nationalities; for he asked me to embody my point of view in a letter to Bin Saud dated the 20th June, No®4 of the correspondence* 10• Letter No* 8 aimed at being nothing but a polite letter closing the correspondence, paying a well-deserved tribute for the manner in which his envoy conducted the negotiations and expressing an amiable hope that a meeting between the Sultan of Kejd and the political Resident would plane away all asperities# 11. It only remains to allude briefly to the three demi-official letters No. 9, 10 and 11, which close the list of correspondence* They were purposely made demi- official as I declined to cc-rnit myself In writing to the Sultan of Nejd in regard to the three matters raised* Of the three, the envoy was inclined to insist, here rather from a personal point of view, on the return of Abdulla A1 Q^saibi to Bahrain. He said he could not return to Riyadh empty-handed and hoped that the return of Abdulla A1 Qasaibi - the envoy was careful to add 'of course in a purely private capacity* - would be warmly appreciated by the sultan as a burial of the hatchet at his (the Sultan's) request. 12. I declined to accede to the request that Mohammed Sherif should be sacrificed as a counterpoise to the depos ition of Qasaibi for I have every assurance from the Political Agent, Bahrain, that Mohammr'! Sherif is a thoroughly useful and enlightened member of society and behaved very well during the recent disturbances, but I said that I had no objection io writing him in general terms a warning letter through the— -7- the political Agent, Bahrain (No*10 of the correspondence). Finally the Agent pre88^' , . for a recognition by me of Abdulr Aziz A1 Qaeaibi, eyen though merely as private agent, without a direot request from the Sultan of Nejd, in fact asked me to say that he was a person acceptable to Hl B Majesty's Government# I said this was going a little too far as to the best of my knowledge I had never seen Abdul ^.ziz A1 Qasaibi in my life and knew nothing about him® The ti*e of the envoy 1 s departure was drawing very close when this question was raised and I said that,before I could give an^ kind o o facial recognition, it would be necessary for me to consult the Political Agent, Bahrain, as to the Qualifications of Abdul A ziz, on such recommendations to form my own judgement and submit my proposals to India and London for their approval which perhaps I «lf»:t then be permitted to convey to His Highness the Sultan of Hejd» The normal and regular course would bo for Hia Highness the Sultan to address me on the subject. If, however, he felt unable to make so complete a surrender, he could write privately to Abdul Aziz A1 Qasaibi warning him not to transgress the limitations imposed on him by His Majesty's Government, when quite possibly. His Highness would find that Abdul Aziz would be allowed to consolidate his position quietly and gradually* That was the very furthe/st I found myself in a position to concede* I could not do so otficially in wetting to the Sultan, but I would write demi- officially to Major Daly on this subject# This letter, No»ll, closes the list of corresDondence# The envoy and I parted the very best of friends.

A.C. My f ri end It had occurred to both myself and the Political Agent, Bahrain, that it was possible that your Highness had not appreciated the full meaning of sir Percy Cox 1 letter to Your Hignhess of the 19th/21at April' 1923, no . S.O ./663, on the subject of a loan from the High Government and the pecun iary assistance which the High G-ovemment has for many months been giving to your Highness at the rate of £ 5,000 per month. We may be mistaken in this belief but,'after a perusal of sir Percy Cox 1 letter quoted above in the presence of your envoy, Syud Hashim, the latter, while he stated ex pressly that he had no information nor instructions on the subject, admitted that the Arabic rendering of • a &gt; passage in that letter was not altogether clear and might lead to confusion. 1 t is true that a close reading of the follow ing clause would appear to put the meaning beyond a doubt, as it certainly does in the English version but in order that there may be no possible misapprehension, l am directed to repeat what it was intended to convey in that letter • The following are the passages of Sir Percy Cox' letter repeated verbatim. In any case owing to the great financial stringency which I have referred to above His Majesty's Government have instructed me to explain to your Highness that they must contemplate terminating the arrangement under which theythey give your Highness pecuniary assistance to the extent ol £, 3 j000 per month but in terminating the arrangement they offer now to pay you during this year £ 25,000 at once and another £ 25,000/- in six months.' The following is the exact meaning. 'The matter is no longer under contemplation but the High Government has decided that, in view of the great financial stringency relerred to above, they must terminate the arrange ment under which they give your Highness pecuniary assistance to the extent of £ 5,000 per month but in terminating the arrangement they will pay your Highness in this year £ 25,000 at once and another £ 25,000 in six months and no further payments of any kind can be looked for '. ptom this it is to be understood that the former arrangement with you^ Highness has been finally put an end to, but at the same time I do not mean from this saying to imply that the door of help has been finally closed between your Highness and the Great Government, for her clemency is open. The meaning is only that l should show to your Highness, with the fullest claiity, the termination or the previous arrangement.. since then £ 25,000 have been, so l learn from the Political Agent, Bahrain, been paid to your Highness' agent in two instalments, one of £ 5,000 in May and a further £ 20, 000 on the 8th June.

I am to^ invite His Lordships attention to the terms of the communication No.173 dated the 14th of June, 1923, addressed by Lieutenant Colonel Knox to Ibn Saud on the termination of the subsidy and to say that His Grace views \ the suggestion made therein that 11 the door of help has not be^n finally closed 11 as liable to misinterpretation by Ibn Saud, since it is not the intention of His Majesty's Govern- T~- ment to resume payment of a subsidy to this ruler in any circumstances whatever. He considers however that it would not be practicable at this juncture to repudiate the suggestion which was made by Lieutenant Colonel Knox. K K 3. His Grace proposes, subject to any observations which His Lordship may of^er, to infom Lieutenant Colonel Knox that he sees no objection to the return to Bahrein of Ahdulla El Qasalfcl In a private capacity; but that M b return as representative of Ibn Saud could only be approved by H^s Majesty's Government on the conditions stated on Page 5 of the letter No.172 dated the 14th/20th June, 1923, addressed to the Sultan of Nejd. 4. His Grace observes that in his letter No.179 dated 19/20th June, 1923, Lieutenant Colonel Knox addressed Ibn aaudSau^l ae ^'our MajeBty*. He considers It desirable to Instinct the Political Rssioent that this mode of address should he discontinued. 5, His Grace further proposes to approve the attitude adopted ty Lieutenant Colonel Knox in regerd to the question of passport facilities for this ruler's subjects. 6. His Grace will he gled to learn whether His Lordship concurs in the issue of instructions to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in this sense. T am.etc., SdA Hubert Young, for the Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, i 9 WHITEHALL, LONDON.S.W.I. * &lt; P.3020. 21st August 1923. Sir, In reply to your letter No.35971/1923, dated the 10th August 1923, on the subject of the relations of His Majesty's Government with Ibn Saud I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he concurs generally in the instructions which it is proposed to issue to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He would, however, be glad if the Government of India were consulted on the question of the return to Bahrain of Abdul Aziz al Qusaili, and he would suggest that Colonel Knox should be instructed on receipt of replies from the Political Agent, Bahrain to his demi-official letters on this subject to communicate direct with the Government of India before taking definite action. ink. In regard to the question of vlsee on the paeEporte of KeJ'll Bubjects, Viscount Peel observes that Colonel Knox, In the 9th paragrspih of his report of the SSr^ June, ststes that 'Iraq an^ India, to which two countries his (Ibn Baud's) suhjects chiefly travel, are Inclined to Insist on the visa of a British Consul'. In his reply to Itn Seud Colonel Knox makes no suggestion es to how Nejdls travelling direct to In'lla should obtain British visas. Lor&lt;l Peel has not up to the present received any comrmmication from the Government of India on the subject, hut as the question will prohahly he raised in due course, and as Iraq is also concerned thereln r he would suggest that Colonel Knox might he requested to forward a more detailed report on this aspect of the passport question.

From Hesident, Bushire To Colonial Office, London Hepeated to Baghdad and Jerusalem. No.898. Dated 10th October 1923. On the 4th October the Political Agent at Bahrain reported that he had received a letter from the Sultan of ITejd asking whether he had made the necessary arrangements for payment of £25,000 sterling falling due at the 'beginning of October. I have infoemed the Political Agent that the question is being referred and that he should take no action except, if necessary, informing the Sultan that he has referred the question. It now becomes immediately necessary to consider what action should be taken in regard to this payment, and I incline to the view that it would be preferable to pay, to keep Bin Saud in a good temper during the conference, regar ing which no repl^ is yet forthcoming. If the contrary view prevails, that payment should be suspended until the results of the conference are known, the argument might be employed that Bin Saud has quarrelled openly in the course of the last six months with every neighbour of his except his notorious enemy, the King mf the Hedjaz, that his conduct in regard to Yemen, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq and Trans-Jordania has, whether intentionally or by misfortune, given cause for disquiet to His Majesty^ Government and that they would prefer to await the result of the Peace Conference to reassure themselves of his peaceful intentions. I, however, earnestly deprecate the second alternative, which I consider will make Bin Saud exception- -ally difficult to deal with throughout the conference. I beg the favour of early orders. Knox.A Sir, DOWNING- STREET.

X. 2. I have already informed you that it is essential that His Highness should understand that he will receive no further subsidy whatever from His Majesty's Grovernrnent either this year or hereafter beyona the lump sum of £50,000 referred to in the preceding paragraph, and have asked that, if any doubts were felt by you on this point, the Political Agent should, if possible, suspend the pay ment until you are satisfied. 5. I assume from the payments amounting to £25,000 now reported, that you have satisfied yourself that His Highness fully understands the position, but I shall be glad to receive your definite assurance that such is lrv\ actually the case. 4. In this connection I cannot but observe that s the statement in your letter to His Highness No.173 of the 14th of June that the door of clemency remained open waa somewhat unfortunate, as tending to raise expectatiore which THE POLITICAL RESIDENT, IN THE PERSIAN GULF, BUSHIKE.c which will not be realized.

Shaikh Ahmad is constantly hinting that Ibn Salad's power is on the wane, and that large numbers of his tribesmen are likely to cross over into 'Iraq in the near future. This is not the Shaikh's opinion alone, but is pretty generally held in the town.

On the other hand there are many vague rumours, and much loose talx of what is likely to happen. One frequently hears that Faisal ad-Da wish is now on bad temn with the Sultan, and recently feigned sickness and refused to go when summoned; one hears too that Artawtyah is a very different place from what it was a year ago, and that the discipline which used to be ao marked there has gone. Whether these stories be true or not, they seem to indicate that a feeling of insecurity does exist in the Desert, The recent action of the B,I, in stopping the booking of passages and freight to and from Bahrain was interpreted by mftny as the action of His Majesty*8 Government to bring pressure to bear on Ibn Sa'ud , and I understand that this :'o that this opinion is still largely held outside the towi kajor, Political A^ent, Kuwait, Copy to Lieut.

My informant adds that;- *1. The French offer to make all possible facili ties for tne subjects of the Sultan viz;- They promise to exempt Nejdian goods arriving in S^ria irom Customs duties,and even more, they promise not to impose any taxes on goods leaving Syria for Nejd; they also declared that each Nejdian merchant can carry away with him to Nejd up to 1,000 gold pounds if he desires without being arrested for carrying so much gold away, 2,The French do this upon condition that the Sultan of a t ej d arrange to cause continual disturbance on the boundaries of both Iraq and Transjordania, and be always _ . , his friendly to themselves and prevent/men from raiding any Syrian ;Di3trict H , % His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Ac., &amp;c.

B U B H I R E • NS lf al-Hlt h laln^ n MEMORANDUM, H o Reference my telegram No.VS-S dated 18th March 1©24 # Naif al-Hithlain, better known as 'Abul Kilab',shaikh of the Khudhair sub-section of the Shamir section of the &gt; Ajman, called on me this morning. After talking for some time about how warmly he had been welcomed by King Faisal in Baghdad, he suggested that I should give him a letter to Shaikh Ahmad to the effect that he was under British protection, as he intended to stop in Kuwait and did not want the Najd Delegates to cause him Inconvenience! I gather from what he said that he had been c^iven rather broad hints that he had better leave 'Iraq, and Shaikh Ahmad will, in my opinion, be very ill-advised if he gives him a permanent sanctuary here - which I believe he does not intend to no - as this would almost certainly lead to further unpleasantness with Ibn 5a^ud. Naif has never been an admirer of Ibn Sa fc ud *8, and, in November 1020, just a few weeks after the battle'of Jahrah, he seceded and came over to Shaikh Snilm. His sub -section was almost exterminated by the IkhwSn at Zaqlah in December 1&amp;20. After that he lived in Kuwait itself for over a year before' he made his peace with Ibn Sa 4 vld and went back to Najd. Poll m ^^^^-ajor.

In view of his past history,&amp; his undoubted bad influence at the Kuwait Conference ( Colonel Trevor recoinmended that he should not be allowed to attend the conferenee) it would hardly seem desirable that he should be given any official hearing in Jx)ndon,or that any communications sent by Bin Saud through him should be accepted.The Sultan has already been clearly informed by II.H.G. that the channel for his communications with Governm nent is through the Bushire Residency.He has for the last two years endeavortedd to obtain means of direct com? runic at ion with H.H.G. in London.

These gentlemen informed me that they had received more than one letter from the members of their association in Qatif stating that the Amir had ordered them to leave c^atif without delay- The deputation represented that to comply with such an order would mean serious loss to them, as of late their interests in ^atif had increased considerably. ft 4. &gt; &gt; About three weeks ago two Hindus left Bahrein for qatif to open a new Agency there, and the Amir's dissatisfaction with the Hindu community in his town would appear to have dated from the time of their arrival. When I suggested this / however, the deputation stoutly denied it, and stated that signs had appeared^before the arrival of these two Hindus, of the Amir^s intention tp expel the Hindu community. The deputation attributed the Amir T s order to a false rumour which has been deliberately spread by some interested Arab zm. merchants in (^atif that Hindus were refusing credit to ^atifis in Bahrein and exacting hard terms from them® Time has been too short for me to obtain any definite outside information on this subject, but I cannot help feeling thai theiMv the arrival of two fresh Hindus in qatif less than three weeks prior to tiniT*s order has some significanceo I have asked the deputation to state their case in writing, which they have dene, and I enclose a copy herev/ith. I would suggest that a letter 'be addressed by you, if you deem it advisable, to the Sultan 01 Nejd or if possible to the Amit of tot if ( to reach me Toy the next down mail ) informing him of the above report and requesting him to confirm or deny it, and to inform you of any causes of his dissatisfaction with the Hindus* I am doubtful if we would be justified in bringing pressure to bear on him to permit the Hindus uO stay against his will, 'but it seems t«:&gt;aaothat we can at least demand that he give# them a reasonable time to dispose of their stocks and realise their debts before turning them out axtogeuhe^. in view of the fact that their connection with qatif is one of such a long standing.

Ke states that Nejd revenue official who was here few days ago informed him that Hindus have annoyed local Arabs by tricky and grasping methods of business and attempts to exploit the ignorance of the Arabs. He did not know how far the Amir had gone in ordering expulsion, or whether he was acting on his own initiative or on orders from Ibn Saud. As the latter is in Hejaz he thinks IBN JILUWI may be behind tl^e present situation. C^osaibi is willing to write immediately to the Amir to enquire into the matter and to press him to give the Hindus four or five months at least until date season is over before requiring them to leave. May he do so ? Attitude adopted hitherto is not to use Q,osaibi as a means of communication with Nejd, but.I think the time has come when this policy might be relaxed.

Sir, ^ // t** ^ •Vith reference to correspondence ending with your telegram ITo. 392 dated 21st June, I have the honour to infcm you that I received a visit yesterday from Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz ^asaihi^ during which he stated that he ^ ^ ^ received a message from the Amir of Qatif to the effect *4 b la ^' e;r objected to the behaviour of one of the Hindus only ( named « Magan*# and that only by bringing *f-WT * 1 ? A \ 4 pressure on the whole community had he been ahle to force this man to leave Qatif, which he had done about a fortnight ago. The Amir was said to have no objection whatever against the remaining Hindus so long as they behaved themselves, and they might stay for the next 4 or £ months or as long as the liked under those conditions. It appears that the Hindu ' Kagan ' had been spread- -ing disparaging rumours in Qatif about the credit and standing of certain Arab merchants in Bahrein, who caused complaints to be made to the Amir about him, with the result »&gt;nich has been seen. Thetil The Khan Bahadur aeeured me that the matter was now settled so long as arrangements are made to prevent Magan 1 s return to Qatif» He was unable to give me this in writing y yesterday, as he wished ^st to obtain a separate letter from the Amir on the subject to prevent the possibility of a mistake* This should arrive in about 2 days time# In the meanwhile, I have spoken to the represent- -atives of the Hindu Merchants 1 Association here, and informed them of the position. They state that the man who returned recetly from ^atif to Bahrein is Lalchand and not M Magan ' ( Maganmal ), who is still in (^atif. Both these men however belong to the same firm of Commission Agents ( Lalchand Maganmal ) in ^atif, and the Hindus here feel sure t'lat the Amir ? s anger is directed only against Lalchand. This matter will be apparent when the Amir* s message is received in a few days* time, and in the meantime steps are being taken to prevent Lalchand from returning to Q,at if. The Hindu question in Q^atif thus appears to have taken a decisive turn for the better, and I trust that it will bo satisfactorily settled in the course of a few days.

I SHOULD like to inform you about the question of Sayyid-el-Idrisi and his country and its condition. Long ago many complaints began to come to us from certain chiefs of the Idrisi's tribes, and from his generals and leading people. They all complained of the bad government there under which they were groaning, the anarchy in the land and the lack of security for life and property in their country; and they asked us to intervene in their affairs or to extend to them our influence or assistance. We rejected their applications, however, because of the strong friendship and amity between us and Sayyid-el-Idrisi resulting from the treaty with us which existed during his father's time; in the circumstances we were naturally unable to give ear to their demands and requests. It appears, however, that the situation in the Idrisi's territory has become worse than before. I am inclined to think there must be other powerful factors at work which have obliged Sayyid-el-Idrisi to ask us in a letter, which we have received from him, to intervene in the affairs of his country and to take over the reins of government. There is a very ancient friendship and steady affection between us and the Idrisi family. Moreover, there are many considerations and ancient reasons which compel us to assure our southern frontiers, and imperious motives for the preservation of the balance of power in Asir and Yemen. Consequently we could only answer the call of our friend, Sayyid-el-Idrisi, and comply with his request, and bring the area indicated by him under our sway, and we have issued orders to our commanding officer in Asir to comply with the order of Sayyid-el-Idrisi, to occupy all the area the latter might indicate, and to restore peace and order there. This is what has happened up till now. If anything fresh occurs, you will be duly informed. Compliments. (Seal of Ibn Saud,) ••r [1004 dd—2]61/6 oc oj/ll Telegram C. ^rom Political Agent, Kuwait.

Several leading men of the Hindu community in Bah rein came to see me during the afternoon ol Thursday,23rd February, to inform me that they had Just received a com munication from their caste men in i^atif to say that they had 'been given 8 days time, of which 2 had already expire^ to close their accounts, collect outstandings and leave Q,atif. ^y informants had no further information to give and enquired whether any political measure had inspired this order. I replied that I knew of none. The Bunniahs did not press the matter, I think they are genuinely mystified by the order, Mr .Ghanshamdas has today inform ed me that the Bunniahs have been given an extension of time in Qatif, up to one month. There are only two frjms in Qatif, probably 4 individuals and possibly some ser vants . $ In accordance with the precedent of 1925 (see Qaptain. # Malices No.63 dated 13th July) I have taken no action except to ask the Bahrein Customs authorities not to take immediate steps to recover full rates on the re-export cargo lyincj in Bahrein av/aiting 3.^1 orient to Qatif. ^ # In 1925 the expulsion of the Bunniahs appears to haveMi rs~&lt;s have loeen due to the rapacity of Bin Saud 's Governor who adopted this means of squeezing them. In a recent case tried 'before me, it came out that Lalchand the Bunniah who was alleged to have defamed in Q,atif certain Bahrein Arabs, paid Hs.llOO/- cash and gave presents worth Rs 1257-5-0 as iUiidam and deductions from grain business. Thus the total bribe to the Governor of ^atif, which pro cured him permission to return was Rs.2529-5-0. I suggested to ilr.Ghanshamaas that he mi^ht use the ke key v/hich was so successful in opening the door of Qatif on the former occasion. He replied that it was ail very well once in a way, but was liable to become too costly, I was at first doubtful whether the present expul- sion was due to an attempt at xxbx extortion, or to or ders from Bin Saud who hoped by this means to put some slight pressure on H.M's Government.

Ismailghaznayi, Amritsar, (India), Dated 8th December 1927. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. 3ir, You are no doubt aware of the fact that a number of Hedjazi Arabs, who are enemies of the present Hedjaz Government, are under the leadership of 3yed Mohammad Husain Aldabbagh Alhussaini carrying on a maliciously hostile propaganda against the Government of His Majesty the Xing of Hedjaz and Hejd. Had their activities been merely confined to propagate systematic untruth against the .'ahabees, I would not have troubled you. But now their activities are assuming a very dangerous turn and are aiming directly at the overthrow of the Government of His ^lajesjty the King of Hedjaz and Uejd by fair means or foul, I wonder if you consider such acts of overt hostility to the Hedjaz Government to come under the category of 'subversive propaganda' against the Government of Hedjaz and as such contrary to the spirit and letter of the Anglo Hedjaz Treaty signed at Jeddah this year. If so, would you kindly draw the attention of His Excellency the Viceroy to this fact so tiK t these nefarious activities may be nipped in the bud. I give a few quotations from one of their phamphlets in TTrdu which is distributed gratis in very large numbers. 'The aim of this Hizbul Ahrar (the Party of Liberty) is to purge Hedjaz of the hateful bureauaracy which has shed blood indiscriminately and to wreak its vengeance on that (Government) who have violated the sanctity of Hedjaz by their foul and polluted deeds' (pamphlet P.4). If'If we ask the v/aha 'bee (xovernirient to quit Hedjaz, our demand is not so unreasonable as to make us rebels and sinners' ( jix&amp;teaaix Pamphlet p# 4). 'Therefore, we declare it on behalf of the Hedjaai/ with all the emphasis at our command, that we do not recognize Ibn 3aud as the rightful King of Hedjaz, but regard him e usurper and a tyrant. V.e further repudiate the oath of Allegiance to him (which we were forced to take' (Ibid p»5). We request all the Moslems of the '.vorld to cooperate with us in bringing about the overthrow of the present Government of Hedjaz and to crush the growing Wahabee power which is a menace to tiie whole Moslem 1 7orld'(Ibid P. 10). Similarly in the weekly organ of the Jamiat-i-Khuddam- ul-Harmain of Lucknow called * the Khadimul Harmain', we find the following remarks in its issue of November 21st, 1927. 'Every true believing Moslem whould not rest until Hedjaz is purged of the sway of this tyrannical Government' (November 21st, Ho. 19 ?•!)• I 9 I' The letter headed ' An appeal of the Hedjazis to their Moslem brethren of India' (P. 3 Fovember 21st, lTo.19) is full of xk scurrillous abuse of the Hedjaz Government. I need not encroach upon your valuable time by giving further excerpts from the extremely malicious literature with which these enemies of the Governinent of Hedjaz and Nejd are daily flooding India. It is time that their nefarious activities were sternly checked, otherwise they might lead to very serious consequences and international complications. I need hardly point out that any further connivance at and continuance of these activities would have a very baneful influence on the Moslems of India themselves and dividing them into various hostile camps would fan their fanaticism, thus jeopardising the internal peace of India. No doubt your Government have had very anxious moments on account of t^e Wahabee - Hanafi disputes last year and any freshfresh recrudescence of the same would not only be a grave menace to the internal peace and order of the country, but cause the Indian Govern .ent no end of trouble and and not let this conspiracy against the GovernLient of Hedjaz and ITejd on the one hand and the internal peace and order of India on the other mature and burst into flames, for them the conflagration would be so serious that with all their mighty resources the Government of India might find it difficult to check and control. Kindly place my views before His IScceilency the Viceroy and let me know if his Government is prepared to move in the matter not only in the interests of the amicable and friendly Anglo Kedjaz relations but in the interests of preservation of peace and order in India as well» anxiety.

Ratanmal son of Kanaysmal and Magannal son of Chonamal who had been carrying on 'bueinesB at Qatif, mainly as comLiiseion agent for their caste men in Bahrein,though thev di&lt;i a little nrivate 'business also, arrived here in i the morning of 1st April. They came to see me next day. 2, According to their own statement tne ^ir of Gatif, Mahomed hin Suwailim sent for them in the morning of Thursday 29th March, and received them in his Majlis^ wnere he was sitting among his guards and a number of townsmen. 4 V/hen Ratanmal and Maganmal entered his presence the Amir informed them that their frieud Lalumal V^atumal had abused the people and that the Qatif merchants complained that owing to the large quantities o -0 rice and sugar whicn they imported tne local traders were unable to compete and were tnre^tening to witndraw from the town. He then ordered the Bunniahs to leave Q,atif as soon as a launch was available. The Hindus thereupon protested that they hau consider able sums of money outstanding and a large c ^uaiit.ity of f goods in their warehouses, and asked what arrangements they should make about them. The Amir replied that they should appoint a local trader as their agent to collect outstandingsoutstandings and dispose of tlieir goods but the Buunisdis stated that it was impossible to obtain an a^ent 0 Two days later the Amir sent a man to warn the Bunniaho that the Bahrein launch had arrived. The Bunniahs there upon made a fin^l personal appeal to kahomed bin Suv/ai- lim about their ^oods and outstandings and complained of the short notice tuat had been g^ivexi theiii. The /^nir^how ever^ replied that it was for them to decide whether to appoint an agent or not^ Iwafc they must go to Bahrein that day .but could come back after two days to appoint an agent 0 Ratanmal aiid Maganmal accordingly left Cat if by launch about 2 p.m. on Saturday 31st karch. Tho ^mir sent his Fidawij kutrij to eec- that they actually embarked. If- The Bunnialis inforiu me tuat until the sudden order for their expulsion the relations between theuselvcs and the Amir and merchants of Q^atif h-td invariably been freindly. They alv/ays carried out the iimir'c orders and imported the goods he required. They consider the charge that Lalumal had becxi abusing people somewhat belated considering that this individual had left Qatif for India 45 days before it was made. 5'- The outstandings in the hands of various Qatif d 4 deotors amount to Rs.20,000/# while LOO tins of ghee valued at Rs.6,000/- and 4,000 bags of rice valued at Rs.70,000/- have been left in the Bunniahs warehouses at ^atif. The goods are stored in tv/o big buildings the property o^Hassan bin &gt;i.li L^arzuq and of Haj i Hassan bin Salat. The goods are in rooms each of which is pad- locked^but tnere is no special wc tchman over the ware houses other than the ordinary town guard. io. The Bunniahs can give no reasons for their expul sion other than those already mentioned. They stated however^ that Pahad, the con of Sheikh i^udulla bin Ji 1 avi of Hasa was expected to come to Qatif on tour,after a day or two^to inspect his father 1 s estwtes. l^ahaci would probably be accompanied by some AidiwanE but they did not thinkI tliinl hi&amp; visit had any 'bemring on tiie ordcrti for their deportation. It is a poueiMlity however^ that this visit may have haa some connection v/ith the short notice to quit given by bin Suwailim and his suggestion that a visit might be paid later. I hear J rom Haj i ^airned bin JQiarais, a leading Baharani, that the stut lur Sheikh Ali bin Hassan Ali Al Khanai zi the ShiaJa Iraoxr and directed hin to pray in his own house and not in pub- lie at the Mosque during the tine bin Jilawi's Akhv /an were in tatif. It would appear therefore that he dreads the possible results of Akhwan fanatici eh .. HaJ i Ahmed himself is of opinion that the BunniatiS were expelled as they are British subjects and it was fearea that their presence might give il.L's Government an excuse for interference, ~J, I enquired from Abdulla Al Qusaiti as to whether he had any infomation about /the caufac oi the expulsion and he replied that he understood that the Baharaneh i .e.the 1 mm I J I Shii-iis of Q.atif -^population is v^holly Shiali - have brought false charges against the^. He consic^ere 1 the exclusion of the Hindus was a very bad rove on the part of the Qatif authorities as they paid Re.40,000/- in Customs dues, and apart from then, there was not a trader in Uttif who could command capital of R8 »l,000/-, The latter part of Q.usaibi's statement is an exaggeration but it is a fact that the native Q.atili traders are all small men. The Bunniahs theniselves state that they pay one lakh of rupees yearly, to the Qatif Customs House. It is ob vious that a very considerable portion of the trade of C^atif was in their hands. 4 It happened that ADduila qusaibi was on the point of paying a visit to C atif. I asked him to enquire as ^ to the reason for the action taken against the Hindus. He has Just returned to Bahrein and reports tuat the Amir disclaims all responsibility for the s,/f&lt;Uir. He waswas merely carrying out the written orders of liin i^aud himself. He says that a number of the Cv'atifie s^nt a petition to Bin Saud complaining against t-ue Bunniahs un and tlxfitt thereupon Hia Kajcsty, without any enquiry or- dereu their expulsion being under the impression^ap parently^ thy. t they were traders who had just arrived. . Bin Suwailim promised to snow Q.usaiLi the orders he had received but did uot do so, Qusaibi says there is no doubt that bin Suwailim would willingly receive the Hindus back but he is not a free agent in this matter. The oraer came to him from Bin Saud himself through Bin Jilawi of Hasa and he is bound to carry it out. He has however permitted the two Hindus to return to Q^tif for one week to clear up their accounts. He realises that this time is very short but r he canmot do anything more. He hopes'that it may be possible to obtain permission for the return of the Bunniahs for two months during the elate seas on, i.e, July and August, but cannot promise that his request in this matter will be granted. /D. In the circumstances, as the persons deported are un&amp;oubtedly Britisn subjects I recommend a formal pro test against the deportation should be aodged and that His Llajesty the King of Nejd should be asked to permit their return to Catif a As His Majesty is leaving Riadh for Jeddah an opportu nity to make the protest, if H.M's Government should consider it advisable, will soon offer. If the permanent presence of Hindus at Q.atif is repug nant to His Majc-sty I venture to suggest that lie ma^ be asked to grant them permission to visit Qatif for ?. months annually, and also in the present case 2? i , give them permission to remain a sufficient time^to collect their outstandings and all their goods i.hnmuo I vwj . If they have been expelled on the coinplaint of trade rivals they would naturally prefer not to hand ovei tneir affairs to one of the very community that has compassedI J tueir downfall, It' The Eunniahc state th.at 6 months will be reouired * to clear up the situation.

They report that they were well received by the Amir Mchained bin Suwailim, a young man between S5 and 30 years of age, who is simple and of amiable disposition. He has no acquaintance with affairs and is in the hands of Mohamed bin Jabar, who appears to be a superior sort • of Fidawi. ) This individual, who is exceedingly corrupt takes bribes from both sides in any case which comes for settle ment. He v/as responsible for the order prohibiting the purchase of dollars by Qatif merchants or the sale of ghee in exchange for dollars to which I referred in para 2 of my No.G/l38« The order no longer bears hardly on the Bunniahs as the exchange has altered. 3. On arrival Mr. Kakumal and his friend presented the customary present to the Amir i.e. ghatra ( head cover) aii and/aba (cloak) valued at about Rs.100. They presented their letter of introduction and a formal meeting took place. The Amir questioned them as to what business took the Political Agent at Bahrein to Qatar. ForFor their affairs the Anir referred then to the Hai' vrhioh con- s131 b of 5 Shiah nerohants and 13 notoriously corrupt. The most 1 j-f luential persons on the' Kai' are Abdulla Rashid Ghanim, who was dismissed from Bin Saud's service some years for peculation and Mohamed Makki» late of Bahrein and now a Com- mission Agent in (^atif, 4# Hasan ^usaibi had warned the Bunniahs that soft words would carry no wtlght with tJie Amir, and that if they desired anything they would have to speak sharply to him. This advice was repeated to them by Mohamed bin Hassan Bu Ashar the only Sunni merchant m Qatif. Accordingly when the Bunniahs saw that they would get no redress from the' Hal', they informed the Amir that it was hopelessly corrupt and they saw no justice in his town. The Amir thereupon called Abdul Aziz Sulaiman bin Ghanim and sent him to the Hal with the Bunniahs• Through the intervention of this gentleman a settlement was arranged by which Ahmed Zakki ( see para 6 of my Ko.ClSfi) agreed to pay 5 annas in the rupee before the end of Dhil Qaada and the remaining 11 annas in the rupee in 5 annual instalments Abdul Aziz Sulaiman is surety for the payment of the first 5 amias in the rupee, A second claim against Radhi bin All bin Liukamil was arrang ed by an agreement to pay 1/5 cash, and 1/3 by two equal annual instalments, the remaining third being foregone. As surety for payment Radhi mortgaged his landed property to the Revenue Department at Qatif. The Amir attested the document and agreed to sell the property and settle with the Bunniahs in the event o f Radhi* s default. 5# The Bunniahs, who were well satisfied with the result of their visit parted with the Amir on excellent terms. He went to the extreme of friendliness by excusing them the payment of Khldma ( court fees ) on their claims. This at 10^ amounted to a gift of over Rs.600, as in addition to their in Bahrein own claims they were ^'JfUfhmg those of a Bunniah friend named \ Parshotamdas Vlsumal. The Khidma is levied on the plaintiff only and is never ( • passed-■7- OcP paasGd on to the Defendant by the Court. The result is that many poor Plaintiffs are unable to file suits. 6. The Bunniahs report that the /jiiir stated that the Hindu merchants has been turned out from Qatif by order from supoii or authority&gt; but that if those higher authorities are moved in the natter he will certainly support any request for t?i0ir return, as he sees they are good men, and the expulsion v/as ordered under a misapprehension. He admitted further that tiie income of Qatif had fallen considerably during the past two m onthe # Buashar informed Mr, Kakumal that the petition for the expulsion had been prepared by Abdulla Rashid Ghanim and MoJiamed Llakki and had been forwarded through Amir Mohamed bin Suvrailj m. ^• Maghanmal and Ratanmal the two Bunni ahs who were turned out of Qatif on 31st March as reported in my C1&amp;8 and who returned there on 11th April as reported in my No.138 are still in Qatif, disposing of stocks and clearing up outstand ings as iar as possible. The Amir has granted them an extension oi r„ime&gt; until the end of Dhil (iaada. He informed Mr. Kakumal that if they required 4 or 5 days more there would be no object ion. This mea^is that they will be able to remain in Qatif till approximately 24th May. Their stores of Rangoon rice . tb re being sold quickly and it was anticipated that the Calcutta rice would be all disposed of at the Rukba ( This in Bahrein is on iat Dhil Haj ). it was expected that no stocks would xemain after the Rakba, but there would still be considerable a outstndings on account of past credit accounts. Points of interest mentioned by Mr. Kakumal are:- (a) The annual revenue of Qatif and jts aurrouncling com try is Rs, 12 lakhs. Tliia 13 made up from - (4) Customs. (/d) lax on the sale of sheep, goats and ghee. The sellers being Bedouins the tax is rearovered from the purchaser.

We have been informed that they were for a long time staying in Qatif but We did not know that from you neither did you previously inform Us except lately when you said that they wished to open a permanent trading shop and that they were prevented. All that We knew about them was that they used to come from time to time to spend a certain period in Qatif in the days of Essulok season and that they return after the end of the said season to their home. Now that the British Government have asked Us to allow them to return to Qatif to finish their work in a fixed time, We have granted the request of the gri-tisli Government and allowed them to return to Qatif and to stay there three months only during which they will finish their work.

HIS Majesty's attention was directed, after the completion of the last pilgrimage season, towards the introduction of many improvements in the internal affairs of His Majesty's dominions. One of the things to which His Majesty has given his high attention is the Idrisi Province, which, in accordance with the treaty concluded at Mecca on the 22nd September, 1926, is under His Majesty s protection. His Majesty, may God preserve him, desired to help it for its weltare ano the prosperity of its' people. So he issued his gracious orders for a special Koyal Commission composed of Fadh-bin-Zair, Mohammed-al-Hejazi, Saleh the Doctor and Ahmad-bin-Hleil, to be sent to the Idrisi Province to discuss and consider jointly with the Legislative Council there such affairs as would lead to the reformation oi the country and its subjects. The commission actually left, about the beginning o Muharram this year (the 28th May, 1930) and began its work with the authorities there under the supervision of As Sayyid A1 Hasan. The commission worked tor more than four months, after which they forwarded to His Majesty a detailed report ^ in which they fully explained the situation in the Idrisi Province. Atter lie had studied the report. His Majesty found it better to send another commission to consult As Savvid Al-Hasan-al-Idrisi, his Government and his Legislative Council on matters necessary for the administration of the State and the introduction of improvements The second commission left about two months ago under the presidency of Hamad-al-Abdali, and co-opted the members of the first commission as well as the Legislative Council in the Idrisi Province. After careful con sideration and discussion an agreement was arrived at as to the ways and means to be followed for the administration of the country. [301 gg-1] .

Your brother has taken note of your confidence in God, and in him, and of your reliance upon him. This is the hope expected from you and your brotherhood. You will only see from us, by the grace and might of God,' that which pleases you. As to us, be sure before God that we will, please God, do in your country only that which improves your affairs, and the following three results will flow : First, your comfort, tranquillity and the preservation of your administration to yourself; secondly, the comfort of your subjects; and thirdly, the protection of your honour and the honour of your Province against all aggression.— A bdul A ziz.' As Sayyid Al-Hasan and his Legislative Council then decided to send a special deputation of the Hejaz to present to His Majesty the decisions agreed upon, together with two letters from As Sayyid Al-Hasan-al-Idrisi and the Legislative Council. The letters are as follows ;— ' Praise be to God alone. ' From Al Hasan-bin-Ali-al-Idrisi to His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and its Dependencies, Abdul Aziz -bin-Abdurrahman-al-Faisal-al-Saud. ' Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. '' I thank God, who is the only God, and 1 pray for His last Prophet, his relatives and his friends. 'I enquire about your prosperity, good health and tranquillity. I pray God the Almighty that you may be always kept well. If you ask about your affectionate friencl, I am, by the grace of God, as well as you wish. There is nothing but good health and prosperity. I have received your Majesty's esteemed favour of the 15th September, 1930, which I have read, thanking you for your kindness and courtesy, may you ever live in happiness and prosperity. '' Your kind letters sent by the hand of the brother. Sheikh Hamad-al- Abdali, have been received and their contents noted. 1 thank your Majesty for the advice you have given to my country and for the care you have shown towards our interests and the organisation of our affairs, in a w T ay that will maintain our honour and comfort. ' In compliance with your suggestions and friendly advice, with which I agree, T sent round for your Majesty's deputation, and discussed with them the matters you referred to, of which the principal ones are the administration and the adjustment of the finances of the country. The decision agreed upon is the one communicated to your Majesty in the letter of my council. So there is nothing left undone on my part or on that of my people regarding the measures which 'have to be undertaken towards the country and its improvement and concerning consultation with your Majesty. I pray God may grant success to all. ' I wish to draw your Majesty's attention to the fact that I, on my part, have proved my friendship and connexion with your Majesty, and T believe that I have increased your Majesty's inconvenience, that is to say, I have laid upon your Majesty's shoulders my task and my hopes for the protection of my honour and the comfort of my country, trusting that your Majesty's endeavour for me in this connexion is better and more hopeful (than mine own). I am therefore confident that your Majesty will act in this respect as you would do for the interests you cherish most, and by this means I would attain the end that I desire and expect. ' In truth your Majesty will realise that our connexion is not of recent elate, and it is full only of the faithfulness and the noble character registered in the white pages of your Majesty's prestige. ip ff 3~W ' i swear by God, the only God, that 1 am keeping faithful and ' o y i ?' ^ your Majesty outwardly and inwardly. I have never thought of ^nyMi g contrary to friendship. Anything attributed to me contrary ne J - courtesy is false and groundless. Here I am registering in history an obvious proof of the truth of what I have said by entrusting the protection ot my country, my subjects, my comfort and my honour to the charge of your Majesty s honour, and by making your Majesty responsible for all of tlm /m quite sure of your noble and pure character and honour. I await your reply to reassure me as to that which I expect, namely, the maintenance oi my rights and my honour, and the regard of my private people and relatives and the appreciation of their connexion with and services to me. your Majesty will then be entitled to whatever facilities the aim and helps the realisation ot the desired end. Notwithstanding that I am sure of all this, nevertheless, as A1 Khalil (Abraham) said, I want my heart reassured. God is the best witness to what we say.' The letter of the legislative Council : — ' His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and its Dependencies, Abdul Aziz -bin-Abdurrahman-al-Faisal-al-Saud. May God help him : ' Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. ' After enquiries about your health and comfort, we hope, please God, that you, your noble sons, and all your friends, are quite well, enjoying tho best of health and complete happiness every year.
