The Staff Officer (Intelligence), Levant and Eastern Mediterranean, ALEXANDRIA. INTELLIGENCE - RED SEA AREA . I have the honour to submit the following report on a visit to Eritrea, Kamaran and Saudi Arabia in H.M.S. STEVENSTONE. (Lieutenant-Commander C.A.H* Owen, DSC R.N.) (a) MOVEMENTS As previously arranged, I proceeded from Cairo to Asmara on 26th September, and after spending two days with the Defence Security Officer, Eritrea, and the Area Command proceeded by road to Massawa and joined H.M.S. STEVENSTONE. From Massawa, the ship proceeded to Kamaran, v/here I had the opportunity of discussions with the British Civil Atoinistrator and local notabilities, and thence to Jedda (Saudi Arabia)•^ On completion of my intelligence duties at Jedda, I left the ship and proceeded by air to Cairo, arriving on 6th October, 1945. (b) ERITREA It is beyond doubt that the Italian Government, in the heyday of its espansionist policy, never conceived Eritrea as a colony apart from Ethiopia. The early development of Eritrea - notably reading - pointed to its use, originally as a stepping stone to Ethiopia, and ultimately as part of an Ethiopian-Eritrean colony. With the collapse of Mussolini’s Ethiopian adventure, Eritrea lost its importance and rapidly became an over-colonised country. Prior to the Abyssinian war, the European (Italian) population of Eritrea did not exceed 5,000. This figure has now increased to between 35,000 and 40,000 persons in a country which, even to-day, cannot economically support a European colony of, say, 10,000. Recently, this number has to some extent been reduced by repatriations to Italy. Progress has been limited by the general shortage of shipping, but it is anticipated that the rate will be expedited during the next few months. The Italian community shows little optimism in regard to the future of the colony. Its return to the Italian flag would be entirely welcomed. But few, if any, anticipate such a happy outcome. Main hopes rest in the possibility that the .country may pass under a United Nations trust. An irredentist move for union with Ethiopia has complicated the situation on the native side. Irredentist propaganda, originating from Ethiopia, has gained an active following of perhaps 10 per cent of the native Eritreans, and a number of demonstrations have occurred. There is occasionally an anti- British touch: 'Get rid of the British ... the British starve us'. Among the inarticulate mass of the population, irredentism is received with mixed feelings and it has been estimated that opinions on the issue are approximately equally divided. The consequent risk of demonstrations being met by counter-demonstrations represents some risk to internal security. There is little doubt that H.M.S. STEVENSTONE*s visit created a favourable impression among the local population. One particularly effective move, arranged through the co-operation of the British Military Administration, was to entertain on board some 30 chieftains representing the principal native tribes and groups in the country. For.the majority, it was the first /occasion ••••..- 2 - &amp; occasion they had visited a warship and they left visibly impressed with the work of the Royal Navy* This was appropriately enhanced by the exhibition to them of several excellent films (with Arabic commentary) depicting the strength of British sea power. . One man, who claimed to have served in the Italian Navy, made a representative remark when he observed on departure: 'No wonder the Italians were beaten .' (c) KAKARAN Kama ran is preparing for its full normal role as quarantine station for the Moslem pilgrims proceeding from India to Mecca. Prom the peak of 37,500 pilgrims in 1937-38, the number dropped almost to nothing during the war years. The pilgrimage from India is now, however, being resumed on a limited scale, and the first ship arrived at Kamaran within a few hours of the STEVBNSTONE 1 s departure. Shipping movements will, however, remain on a relatively small scale for some considerable time and are not likely to approach the pre-war figure (1938) of 133 ships of which 57 were pilgrim carriers. Kamaran itself gives every impression of being a happy and contented community, with some pride in its British affiliations. Even a casual visitor cannot but be impressed by the general well-being of the somewhat hybrid community, their respect and affection for the British administration and (among the leading classes) their appreciation of the protection afforded the island by the Royal Navy. This last point was presented in a spontaneous and genuine tribute paid by local celebrities who tendered a small official reception to the commanding officer of the STEVENSTONE. The main speaker expressed gratitude to the Royal Navy for protecting the island from their enemies and from the threat of starvation. This point was taken up immediately by the Qali (religious and civic leader) who interjected, to sounds of agreement from the whole party, that their prayers had been constantly for British success. An equally good point was made by the Commanding Officer of STSVENSTONE in his reply when he observed that the spirit of unity, good faith and brotherly friendliness of war years should be perpetuated in the peace. This remark was met by cries of 'Indeed that is true'. Some twenty-four hours before the STEVENSTONE*s arrival at Kamaran, the island had been visited by King Farouk, in the \ Egyptian Royal Yacht, in the course of a Red Sea cruise.. He expressed some interest in the present and future status of Kamaran, to which he received guarded replies from his host, the British Civil Administrator. His Majesty pointed out that Kamaran was captured by the British from the Turks in 1915, and then observed that the Imam of the Yemen had taken over ex-Turkish territories. To this he received the reply: 'Yes, in the Yemen.' His Majesty*s next inquiry was whether Britain had annexed Kamaran, to which the Administrator* s ansv/er v/as: 'Not yet.' |r He then observed that the Union Jack was flying on the island and (I made a remark as to v/hether the Kamaranians were British subjects v and whether the Imam had claimed certain other islands in the ares4 He also spoke about Perim being British territory and emphasized its strategical importance. Before his departure, King Farouk presented £500 to the islanders to assist in the completion of a new mosque and also purchased pearls from local agents to the value of some £400- The reception he received on the island v/as by no means over whelming. The population appreciated that the visitor was a celebrity and salaamed accordingly, but they had little or no inkling that he v/as the King of Egypt until after his departure. His Majesty took pains to emphasize that his visit was purely /informal .... -an£ ^ &gt; altogether, his Bed sea cruis’e ?/as merely an attempt to leave 'red tape' and the cares of office behind for a time* He mentioned that he had visited several of the remoter islands (including Centre Peak Island) and had carried out soundings with a view to correcting existing charts of the Red Sea. Other objects of the King’s cruise have been dealt with in separate papers. He had previously visited the Yemen - and, of course,^Jedda as well, - but from the evidence available, the King, when in the Yemen, did not make contact with the Imam or with the Heir Apparent, the Crown Prince. At Jedda he met only Prince MANSOUR. (d) THE YSM5N The Yemen, an independent Kingdom under the sovereignty of the Imam Yahya, remains closed to Europeans, but intelligence reaching the adjoining island of Kamaran indicates that there has been little or no change in the internal situation. The Imam continues to wield absolute authority, and there is little doubt that quarrels over the succession among his sons will precipitate serious disorder following his death. For some years the Imam has been a somewhat feeble and rapidly ageing man but his sanctity in Moslem eyes (he claims descent from the Prophet) maintains his strength and leadership among his people. It is rumoured locally that only the British have kept him alive by sending him supplies of modem drugs such as penicillin. The question of succession to the Crown on the Imam’s death remains the burning issue. The Crown Prince, who would normally succeed, remains out of favour and it is believed that he has not seen his father for four years. The second son has the ear of the King, but his prospects are not likely to be favoured by the powerful religious leaders who complicate the situation by their strong personal motives. King Ibn Baud’s attitude to the Yemen is also to be considered* Between 1926 and 1934, friction culminating in hostilities occurred between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, peace being restored by the Treaty of Taif which secured Ibn Baud’s legal title to Asir and Najran, and defined the frontier between the Yemen and Saudi Arabian territories. There are rumours, however, that Ibn Baud guaranteed these frontiers only durino* the present Imam s lifetime and that, on his death, he may well aspire to the acquisition of the Yemen. This might be facilitated by an internal Yemeni crisis brought about quarrels and disorder on the question of the succession. (e) SAUDI ARABIA Although King Ibn Saud remains concerned with the Palestine problem, there is no doubting the friendship which he shov/s towards Britain. This sentiment is translated through every class of the community, and H.M. ships are assured of a cordial welcome. In thecase of STEVENSTONE, both Government circles and the^local population^of Jedda, showed their appreciation of the visit, and a very friendly greeting was received from Ibn Saud v/ho, at the time of the ship’s visit, was at Taif. The main threatto British prestige in Saudi Arabia comes from American economic influence. Saudi Arabia’s revenue is based almost entirely on three sources. (a) Revenue from the pilgrim traffic. (b) Royalties from the gold mining concession. (c) Royalties from the oil concessions. Income from the pilgrim traffic fell away to nothing during ' /the- 4 - the war years, although this was to some extent balanced by a subsidy paid to King Ibn Saud by the British Government* The mining and oil syndicates, which were also affected by the war, but which are now returning to large-scale production, are virtually under American control* Ibn Saud has made no pretence about the necessity for his financial requirements being met from outside. He and his people undoubtedly dislike and distrust Americans, who they consider have little real sympathy for or appreciation of the Arab peoples* But ^money talks*', and American open-handedness, in contrast to more limited British credits, is a telling factor* Local British residents continually emphasize this point* The gravity with which they view the situation varies, ranging from a remark such as 'We*ve had it here,' to the expression of hopes that British finance may shortly be freer* However, it is in British circles, almost entirely, that the King continues to seek his advisors, and, on the balance, there seems little likelihood that he will voluntarily swing towards the Americans* The main difficulty arises from the fact that American motives can scarcely be regarded as altruistic, and in accepting American assistance- no doubt of necessity if British support is lacking - Saudi Arabia may well be called upon to make a quid pro quo in the form of additional facilities and concessions* King Ibn Saud*s attitude towards the Palestine question appears to remain unchanged. It has been emphasized that his opposition is not to Jewry but to Zionism. However, as before appreciated, it is considered locally that the adoption of an unfavourable policy in Palestine is not likely to provoke him into active intervention* There are a number of persons capable of oeing transferred to Palestine to lead and assist the Palestinian Arabs in the event of disorder, but here again a reliable local opinion is to the effect that the King is unlikely to encourage the departure of these leaders. I personally met one or two of these men, at least one of whom was associated with the 1939 troubles in Palestine* They sho?/ no rancour towards the British. There is a report in circulation in Saudi Arabia that some years ago, the Zionist leader, Weizman, offered £20,000,000 to Ibn Saud if he would use his influence to withdraw Arab opposition to Zionism* The proposal was not accepted* I sounded several of the executives of the Oil Conpany on the proposal to construct an oil pipe-line from the fields on the Persian Gulf side of the country to a Bed Sea outlet. There was some degree of wariness in discussing this subject, but from their remarks, supported by comments from British sources, it appears that the scheme is only in a projected stage and no firm proposals have been made. However, in spite of the heavy cost involved, oil company officials considered it represented a good commerc ial proposition. The King and the Saudi Arabian Government were represented at Jedda during the STEyENSTOKE f s visit by Sheik Youssef, the deputy—Minister of Foreign Affairs, and reputedly the real power m the execution of Saudi Arabia^ external policy. Prince Peisel only nominally holds the Foreign Affairs portfolio. Sheik Youssef v/as entertained on board and proved himself an amiable and intelligent guest. Not unnaturally, the conversation on this and other occasions was diverted from any theme likely to be provocative, but Sheik Youssef made it plain that his personal^ sympathies, and the sympathies of his country, were v/ith the British. He several times expressed pleasure at seeing a British warship in the port of Jedda. /The r1 - 5 - The first pilgrim ships from India and Egypt arrived at Jedda during the STEVENSTONE* s visit. The numbers of pilgrims has shorn considerable variation, the peak being reached in 1937, when a total of 160,000 (internal and external) proceeded to the Holy Places. This included some 75,000 Javanese. Immediately prior to the war, the figure dropped to approximately 50,000, and during the war years shortage of shipping, restrictions on the export of gold (with v/hich the pilgrim traditionally pays his way) and the . Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies brought about a very large decline. The revenue accruing to the Saudi Arabian G-ovemment dropped proportionately, and the British Government met the situation by subsidy. The traffic is now being resumed on a fairly large scale but it will be several years before it can regain its pre-war scale. The way of the pilgrim is not an easy one,* Banditry on the road to Mecca no longer exists - a tribute to the firm justice administered by Ibn Saud and to the exemplary punishments which can, and are, imposed under the lav/ of the Koran. However, there are more subtle and legalised methods of parting the pilgrim from his money. Prices for food and transport are exorbitant, and, although Jedda is one of the safest towns in the world for any stranger, the art of bribery in supplying the basic requirements of pilgrims is practised with a fine finesse. Although about 68 years of age, Ibn Saud remains a King in every sense. Apart from chronic arthritis of the knees, he is in fine health, and I understand that a medical opinion obtained at the beginning of the present year pronounced him as 'being good for another 20 years'. (f) TOPOGRAPHICAL IHTBLLIgENCE With the exception of Massawa, detailed topographical intelligence was collected at each port visited. As a result, it is intended to re-v/rite the Saudi Arabian section of C.B. 1892, and arrangements have been made to completely revise the section of the same C.B. dealing with Kamaran. It was arranged for a Navigating Party from H.M.S.STEVENSTONE to carry out a harbour and pilotage survey of the port of Jedda. This report will be communicated separately by the Commanding Officer. At ray request, opportunity was also taken by the Command ing Officer to revise the ISIS report on Port Sudan. In accordance with Admiralty requirements, approximately 250 ground photographs were taken of Kamaran, Port Sudan, Jedda and the Commercial Port at Massawa. Naval Officer in Charge, Massawa did not permit the photographing of the Naval Base, on the grounds that photographs had previously been forv/arded to the Director of Dockyards. It is suggested that copies of these photographs be obtained direct from the Director of Dockyards by the Admiralty Photographic Library. ISIS and C.B. reports on Jedda and other ports will be forwarded separately to the Director of Naval Intelligence and the inter-services Topographical Department. (g) REPORTING OFFICERS At my request, the Commanding Officer of STEVENSTONE investigated the suitability of the Harbour Master at Port Sudan to take over the duties of Naval Reporting Officer. He v/as considered to be most suitable. At Kamaran, various aspects of merchant ship reporting were discussed with the Naval Reporting Officer, who is the British civil Administrator. Signal Publications held by this officer had been mustered several weeks before by the Staff Officer (Intelligence) Aden. /AsAs a result of* many staff changes, the aection of the British Legation at Jedda concerned with naval reporting duties was confused in regard to present requirements* Arrangements have been made for concise instructions to be forwarded. Signal publications ?/ere mustered and found correct with the exception of one O.U. (1936) which could not be identified at the time* GBK3RAL At Kamaran and Jedda, full co-operation was afforded by the local British authorities in collecting topographical and other intelligence. The opinion was expressed that the Staff Officer (Intelligence) or his representative should, if possible, visit centres such as these at least annually with a view to exchanging information, elucidating points connected with Naval reporting and bringing the appropriate Admiralty publications up to date* I should also like to express my appreciation of the courtesy received on board H.M.S. STEVEN STONE* The Commanding Officer _ and officers were most helpful in all matters affecting my duties and greatly facilitated the collection of topographical intelligence.

Very few dhows were seen and were all fishermen or shell-gatherers either on passage or working on the two main reef areas, that between T1RAN and AYNONAH, the second to the West of EAS MOHA A/,1). It is the practice of these dhows, who come from SUEZ or the HADJAZ, to remain in the area for some months. If they are fishermen, they dry their catches on board and live, in consequence, in an atmosphere aXI their own. (b) A visit was paid to SHiSRMS dHisIKH and M01YA, to the SINAI Police lost there. The visiting officer reported that 'the police post consists of one sergeant and five constables. The post and the camel lines are extremely clean*, the policemen are very smart and alert. The two harbours are rarely visited by dhows exdept when fishermen are blown off tneir course'. (iii)/ TO; — The Commander-in—Chief, hast Indies Station.

XX XX Ship proceeded to AKA BA and the Officers arrived by air at 0955 on 18th November - Plight Lieutenant Windsor, R .... P. (Special service Officer, AMAAN). Mr.Musgrave, Assistant Superintendent Palestine Police - personal assiiant to Deputy Inspector General, Criminal Investigation Department. (b) During the period 18th - 25th November these Officers were shown the whole area and took opportunity to visit various places and people of interest. No^ landings were made, however, in SA , IJDI ARABIA. They returned to Jerusalem by air from Suez on 26th November. . (e) Mr.Musgrave showed me tn police Pile on Anas smuggling through AKABA. There was nothing in this of interest to the naval service which has not already been reported, except that 1 was impressed with the stir caused by the arrival in the Gulf on 10th October of the Destroyers, indeed they caused some alarm and at least one authority, reporting the sighting of strange ships, advocated urgent!/ the presence of Red Bea escort Vessels in the Gulf. As late as 14th November, Colonel Peake Pasha (Officer Commanding Transjordan Levies) was^ still unable to confirm their nationality, but had heard that they were British. If this^ then, was the situation on our side our enemies were probably in the same position though, in their case, their fears would march more nearly with the realities. (d) In conversation with Plight Lieutenant Windsor and Mr.Musgrave I gathered the following:- (i) There is very little traffic in arms from SA’DUI ARABIA and that little is mostly absorbed by the inhabitants of Transjordan for personal use. _ (ii) A steady arms traffic sets frora DamABOuo, a fair ’’run 11 being 120 rifles. ( iii It is believed that there is smuggling of ' / arras on a more gran (lose scale from G.RNNCN, using the Mediterranean seaboard. (iv) The original report of a large shipment through the Gulf of AKABA came from an excellent and most reliable source. ihere do not seem to have been any further shipments since September and the assumption is that those responsible are waiting for the removal of the warship patrols. I understand that land patrols have now been establisned in Southern Palestine, when large shipments through the Gulf will be a matter of some difficulty. , ^ ? . ( e ) general conclusions on the special Arms jr form the subject of a separate report. with regard to the origin of these ar is, • ' at least a permissible guess, where are considerable quantities captured in 1935 and useless to the Italian authorities.

In spite oi objectio X X X X* I i —^I- 'believe that KO^BiiK may after all be used as a clearing port, Italian coastal liners from UAHSA call at KOBBBIE and could smuggle arms ashore in spite of the risK, if it were worth while, and I learn that a fairly efficient rifle will fetch 1,12 in Palestine* Arms could be snipped from KOS , -IB. either by Fhow or in the small and leisurely coastal steamers of this region who ?•. re sure to call occasionally. There are two possible customers within reach - the Arabs of Palestine and the Beduwin tribes of BA*BUI ARABIA. , XXX (f) The petrol was taken off on 25th Hove aber in accordance with previous arrangements, the snip leaving the area at noon for due z .

North H.56. International Map, 1951. Aswan - N.G.56. If it is desired to run arms into Palestine, using the sea routes of the Northern Red Sea, the Gulf of AXABA is hy far the most convenient passage. Direct access can he had to the Palestine border itself* which here provides a good land route into the interior by the IADI ABABA and it© environs. Palestine, however, borders on the Gulf for some six miles only and, together with Transjordan, which has a seaboard of similar length, can be control lad directly from AXABA and from the Egyptian Police Post on the other side of the Bay. 2. If it is desired to land cargoes elsewhere in the Gulf than at the head, the following are suitable anchorages:- (i) SQTPT. (a) GA/’IRA FARAUH - Good anchorage. In sight from (JSZIRAT FARADM) the head of the Gulf and under control, therefore, from ARAB A. (b) NGkEIBA - A village* Excellent anchorage. (HAWIBI) Forty miles from A&amp;ABA. Access to Palestine via WADI HAISI. (c) Not marhed on map®. WAS IT - Ten miles south of NO WE IB A (BA-TBI). A possible anchorage but no village. (d) DAHAB - A village. Excellent anchorage. (DAHAB) Thirty miles from the mouth of the Gulf. Access to Palestine via SINAI but probably one hundred miles. (li) GA*UIjl ARABIA. (a) HAfeAL and HUMAIDHa - Village at HAQAL. (OMEIDEE Island) Excellent anchorages. Twenty-five miles south of AKA8A. Road thereto. (h) MAQHA - Large village. Possible anchorage. (MAGNaH) Thirty miles from the mouth of the Gulf with a road eastward into WADI AFAL and thence to the north, but it is one hundred miles to Palestine by this road (e) Not marked on map. SHBRM DKABA and 3HSRM MU J A WAN - Twelve and fifteen mi lea south from MM.# A . Excellent anchorages but no village. (ill) There may be other anchorages available to Dhows but the above are the main ones and include the only villages on this coast. In general the shores of the Gulf are too steep to make anchorage possible. 5. From the point of view of the gun-runner, however, the whole Gulf suffers under one serious drawback - it is a trap which one warship can spring.(i) It is nowhere more than fourteen miles in breadth and hiding places in it are few, even for small Dhows. (ii) The wind blows almost continuously straight down the Gulf, generally with moderate gale force. To beat up it under sail is a lengthy process. (iii) The two entrances to the Gulf, six miles apart, are each half a mile only in width and can be controlled with ease by day, whilst they offer formidable obstacle! to passage by night. 4. An aeroplane patrol, at uncertain and fairly frequent Intervals, would go far to protect the Gulf. We know that traffic in the Gulf has been nil for the past seven weeks. The Police Officer-in-Charge, AKABA, tells me that no Dhows ever visit AKABA. Hence any Dhows seen in the Gulf may be considered a matter of comment. Odd fishermen from the AYMTWAH area may be seen at the mouth of the Gulf on occasions but they will not come in far for thej are reef fishers. 5. Failing the Gulf of AKABA, it is not possible to approach within less than one hundred miles of the Palestine borders and that only in a very few places. For the purposes of these observations, the seaboard may be divided into four portions;- (i) SIKAI PBKIKSOLA - FROM SUEZ TO TOR. Several excellent places. Indeed, I understand that an attempt has been made to run arms at ABU ZSKIMA. The area, however, is not far from SUE?, and should be controllable from there, at any rate to such an extent as to deter anything but sporadic importation of arms. (ii) SIHAI PEKIHSULA - TOR TO MOUTH OF GULF OF AKABA IffCLUDIHG TIPwAN AHD S3SISAFIK ISLAKDS. ’~Good landingsbul generally uninhabited and a weary way from Palestine. Also there are Police Posts at TOR and at HAS UM SIDD (SHERM SHEIKH). It might be advantageous, however, to land arms here with a view to taking them on up the Gulf of AKABA when the way is clear. (ili ) SA*UDI ARABIA - FROM MOUTH OF THE GULF OF AKABA OX) AYMJHAK. A coast so guarded by reefs as to make access for steamships difficult* It is desert and there is little point in landing arms here from Dhows, unless AYNUNAH became untenable.

On this littoral, AYHUNAH is a base for fishermen who work the reefs inside the island from SHUSHUAH to SILA; MU WAIL A (MOWILA) is a Bedouin market and the 'port* of TEBUK. DHABa (DIBA) is the headquarters of the local HOWEITAT chief and exports charcoal and wood to SUEZ. Any of these places and several other bays form excellent landings for the arras trade and we must depend largely on SA’UDI good-will that they are not so used.

His Excellency the C?overnor of Aden had explained to me before sailing, that he was apprehensive of my reception owing to the differences, which existed at the time, between himself and the IMAM of the YEMEN on the question of the HADRIMJT frontier, but there was no doubt of the cordiality extended to me by the Wazlr who, it is reported by the Political Agent, has hia own differences with the IMAM. Our interview, conducted through the medium of an interpreter, lasted well over an hour during which His Excellency paid us many compliments, professed much admiration and friendly feelings for the British and expressed a desire to visit the ship.

It my be said that the deads® of the said lady occurred most conveniently (for the Regent) for, had it been otherwise, he might have had difficulty m finding another excuse for not coming on board, which, 1 understand, he was most anxious to avoid, as it is reported that he had a shrewd suspicion the wESTON 'had come for him'.

It was hoped that the suspected men would appear with the remainder, and if they did so, it was the intention that Captain Hopkins, with all the regular soldiers at his disposal, would arrest them. If Fart I failed and the suspected men did not appear it was the intention to put Part II into operation* This consisted of sending out small squads of soldiers, to arrest these men in their houses, where they were known to be. 6* Captain Hopkins considered that he had sufficient force to deal with any disturbances which might occur in connection with Part I but he was not satisfied that he hod sufficient loyal men to carry out Part II and at the same time deal with any demonstration which might take place in the vicinity of the Palace and Residency* I was therefore asked if I was prepared to land an armed force in the event of it being necessary to put Part II into operation, the arrival of this force at the Residency being timed to synchronize with the departure of the soldiers to effect the arrests in the town* It was proposed that this force should land either at the pier and march through the bazaar and along the front or land on the beach from boats in the vicinity of the Residency* The former was preferred* Mr* Ingrams and Captain Hpkins suggested that the party should carry out squad drill and exercises on the square in front of the Palace and Residency, until the soldiers making the arrests had returned* 7. I informed Mr* Ingrams and Captain Hopkins that the orders I had received from my Commander-in-Chief were 'To take such action as they might consider appropriate' (see paragraph 2, Signal B) but I pointed out that I considered it extremely Inadvisable that these arrests should be carried out under the cover of an armed force landed from ray ship* I also reminded them of the Political reactions which might be expected, if Part n was carried out as they suggested and resulted in a serious disturbance* B* I then put forward an alternative plan of action whereby I suggested that Part I should be carried out as arranged but that the decision as to whether Part II could be carried out should be deferred until the results of Part I were known and the temper of any crowd which might have collected in the vicinity of the Residency had been gauged. I suggested that the landing party should be kept on board ready to land at a moments notice from any time required, for as long as they wished, but that this party should land only to deal with a serious disturbance or a real emergency* 9* Further I agreed to comply with the Adviser’s request to carry out a ceremonial route march through the town before leaving and also to convey any arrested men to Aden for trial* That evening I gave a searchlight display between 1930 and 2000* 10* Mr* Ingrams and Captain Hopkins concurred in ray proposed plan and all arrangements were made for putting it into operation* A Signalman was landed at the Residency to maintain communication between the ship and the shore and zero hour was fixed for 0730 on Tuesday 8th February* 11.

The/It The conversations turned to the recent koyel Air korce operations at Dlrajaj, in which the forces of the Fudhli Sultan took part. The Sultan expressed the opinion that the greatest moral effect on the hostile tribes had been caused by machine- gun fire from aircraft. Me said that hostile tribes, during air operations, expect bomb© to fall on definite objectives and normally remove themselves to a safe distance to watch. On this occasion, however, they were amassed to find, in some cases, that the aircraft did not drop a bomb, but dived on them in their **trenches” and fired machine-guns directly at them. The cultan was certain that, owing to this unforeseen action, his forces had so little difficulty in occupying the hostile village. The Sultan seemed very gratified when told that the authorities were pleased with hie share in the operation©, hater he said that, if necessary, he could raise a force of some 3,000 men from the tribe© under his control. Be was particularly impressed by the fact that message©, etc., had been dropped on him by aircraft during the recent operations. Me also mentioned that two aircraft had flown over shugra in the past fortnight and had flown on to the Audhali country. 8. The subject of a wireless set was raised in connection with the Arab propaganda Broadcast from London. The Sultan stated that he had been promised a wireless set by the Aden Uovernment but that, a© yet, he had not received it. 9. Hi© Highness expressed a wish to return my call, and, after embarking in the dhow, we returned to the ship. This ia the first occasion, so far as is known, that the Lultan of Shugr® has visited one of the ships of the Red sea Division. On his departure at 1700 he inspected his seaman guard and was saluted with 9 guns. 10. The above information was reported to the Governor of Aden. XXX itAi* ILAJL- | 12.

Oapt&amp;in B.H.Hopkins, the Military Adviser to the Multan, called on the ship. The Resident Adviser, Mr. Ingrams, was on duty up country. 17. At 0935 6th January, His Highness Prince Ahwad returned sty call being received by a petty officers guard; a salute of 11 guns was fired on his departure. His Highness expressed a wish to be shown round the ship and he appeared to be interested in what he saw. During the evening accompanied by 3 officers X dined at the Palace; Captain and Mrs. Hopkins were also present. lb. At 1700 7th January, 'Londonderry* sailed for Qishia, anchoring in a position 049° Asses Ears 5.2 miles, at 1115 on the following day. The Union Flag was flying over the Sultan’s Palace. 19. a representative of the Sultan called on the ship and accompanied by two officers, I returned his call during the afternoon. Owing to the surf on the beach, landing was only possible by native boat. The Multan Ahmed bin Abdulla, accompanied by his brother Halifa bin Abdulla, received me at hie Palace and after expressions of loyalty to the Throne, he made enquiries for His excellency The Governor of Aden, Sir Bernard Reilly, C.I.iu, O.B.E., and for Lieutenant Colonel M.G. Lake, C.M.G. The Multan informed me that all was peaceful in Qishin; there was hardly any sickness. 20. 1 also met Hassan shaibah, the Secretary to Seyyid Buhkr al Kaf of ueyum. He arrived here by dhow about ten days ago and stated that he was not received with open arms; in fact he was advised to remain afloat in the dhow and not to land: however, after lie had explained that he was in charge of the advance party for Mr. Peck of the Iraq Petroleum Company, he was able to disembark and pitch his camp near the landing ground and clear of the village: he states that he is still being overcharged for necessaries purchased in the village. Friendlier relations with the Sultan appear to have been established since Hassan now has the entree to the Palace and was present during my reception. Hassan was understood to say that Cishin was to be surveyed by Peck with a view to it being a possible end of the pipe line. x x Xq$ X X X AB1J . 28* On 17th January, I wae present at a dinner party given by His Highness The Sultan of Lahej. 29. On 19th January, w Londonderry w shifted berth to a single anchor swinging berth preparatory to the arrival of the S.S. 'Strathaird* from Bombay. At 1200 His Highness The Shaikh of Bahrain accompanied by three sons, three nephews and a staff of eleven embarked, being received by a Petty Officers guard. His Highness expressed a wish to purchase some livestock for food consumption by his party during the passage to Jedda and the ship was therefore prevented from sailing until these had been obtained. 30. At 1630, ”Londonderrysailed for Jedda: light to moderate winds were experienced throughout the passage. His Highness was most considerate and grateful for everything that had been done for the comfort of himself and his party, who settled down to life onboard ship very quickly and were soon playing deck quoits and tombola with the ship’s company. Off Aamaran, a message of good wishes for Hie Highness was received from the inhabitants of the Island. 31. A close inspection from the sea of the Zubair Islands was made on the 20th but there was no evident sign of any Italian occupation such as the flying of flags at the lighthouse during/During the approach to Jedda, six aeroplanes or the Baud! Arabian Air Force performed low flying evolutions in the vicinity of the ship and escorted her into harbour where she moored in th© inner anchorage at 1218 on 22nd January* j a p D„A&gt;_ 34. On anchoring the ship was dressed overall and a salute of 21 guns to the national flag was fired. 35. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Sir Header Bullard, K.C.M.CK, C.I.K., boarded the ship on arrival, followed by The Viceroy his Eoyal Highness The Amir Faisal, who was received by an offiedrs guard and a salute of 21 guns. After greeting the shaikh of Bahrain, coffee was taken in the Commanding Officer’s cabin while an address of welcome was read and the plans for the visit to The King of Saudi Arabia were discussed* Both His Royal Highness The Amir Faisal and His Highness The Shaikh of Bahrain left the ship together, being saluted by an officers guard and salutes of 21 guns and 11 guns respectively. 36. On 23rd January, Said el Kurdl Commandant at Jedda called informally: formal calls on the Governor and the Commandant having been waived until the return of the ship for the Haaj. The following information which was obtained during the Commandant’s stay onboard, may be of interest. His age is 44. As a young man he was educated by the Turks* During the wax' he was in the Turkish Army and was captured on the Suez Canal front. A prisoner of war for four months at Ismailia, he was eventually repatriated at the request of the ruler of Saudi Arabia who asked for the release of Arab prisoners provided they joined the Arab forces. He was sent to Akaba where he met Lawrence and assisted in the drive of the Turks northward out of* After the war, he came to Jedda and was present during the (? Hagels and Gilbes^ war. 37. A cricket match against Jedda was played and was lost by three wickets. n ^ A dinner party at the Legation was attended by myself and two officers. 36.

After inspecting a combined guard of Aden Police and Kamaran Civil Police, I was met by the School Children who sang the first verse of the National .Anthem without any accompaniment and I was later introduced to the leading merchants and inhabitants of the Island. We then adjourned to the Court House where speeches of welcome were made (Enclosure No*2). I was much impressed by the manner in which the business was conducted by the Civil Administrator and by the obvious good feeling existing between him and the inhabitants as well as by the loyalty of all persons to the Throne. 12* At 0800 9th December, there was a demonstration of drill by the detachment of Aden Police and at 1100, the principal merchants and inhabitants accompanied by the Civil Administrator were entertained on board and were shewn round the ship, a new 9 experience for some of them. In the afternoon, accompanied by the Medical Officer, I visited the Quarantine C a mps* The arrangements for dealing with a large number of infectious pilgrims were particularly interesting. The camps are singularly suited for use as prisoner of war camps* 13* A breakdown in the ship^s cooling machinery necessitated the landing of all perishable goods in the cold storage of the Island* As a similar defect has recently ocourred in H.M.S.

On Sunday, 12th December, the school children visited the ship. 16. Two machines of Ho,8(B) Squadron, Royal Air Force, Aden, arrived at 1130 on Monday 13th December, conveying the Civil Secretary (Major Sinclair) and bringing a mail. The s.s. AFRICA a small coasting vessel was boarded but had nothing to report. 17. On Tuesday 14th December, the ship was dressed overall and a Royal Salute was fired at noon in honour of the anniversary of the birthday of His Majesty The King. I attended the ceremony on shore. During the afternoon, Able Seaman Frederick R. Hicholls, Official Humber D/J.93130, quartermaster of the watch, observed the suspicious movements of a Dhow, hove to four miles from the ship, and of a Huri; the information was communicated to the Civil Administrator who forwarded the following letter » * * The message which you sent me this afternoon in regard to the suspicious movements of a huri from a dhow to the mainland, has greatly assisted this Administration in the detection of smuggling* The name of the offending huri owner has been obtained but at the moment he is absconding.

The defects having been made good, the stores were re-embarked at 0600 and the ship sailed at 1000, Wednesday 15th, having been delayed approximately 22 hours. The facilities placed at our disposal by the Kamaran Authorities for the landing, storage and re-embarking of the stores were much appreciated and were the means of avoiding considerable loss to the Crown, Ho payment for these services would be taken, 19.

(S 5 12. + * + I anchored about 11 miles oft the 11. .shore of Baklan Island, in 2'i fathers, at 1650, on 2nd June. I sent two off leers ond th# interj&gt;reter ashore to the village and they xmt and talked with a mrsber of the inhabitants, who nmboT about 70, all en^ged in the pearl fishing ; no Europeans or strange ships or visitors of any description had been seen or heard of in the neighbourhood. As the visit occupied in all mrm two hours, I remained off Buhlan for the night, and proceeded at 0700 to Pasht Island, ubout 6 iail.es away : here a similarly blanlc report was received. Fas At and Baklan are the only two islands of this arciiaepeligo which appear to be permanently inhabited - Fmsht village cental tef about ?-o persons - but the pearl fishers are constantly on the move the islands - we observed a party landed for shelling on a sand spit at B1 Cns ?, irat - and there is little aoubt that a landing or even a casual visit, such as our own, would quickly baco-re '-.nown throughout foe rm£ ghbourhood. 14. It me of sore interest to note tmt the foreshore &lt;m the H*B. sice of Fasht provided a ready-use landing r round for aircraft, being some 1200 yds. long by 500 yes. across, on an average transverse slope of 1 in Sou, for ea of a firm, coralline ”gravel*, with no visible gullies, undulation© or vegation, and no -round hiffeer than SO or 90 ft. in the neighbourhood.

I landed with the interpreter, and walked to the village, where I was hospitably received by the Akil and his brother : they and other members of their family accompaniec roe bach on board, and some medical attention required was arranged for by the Doctor, who landed with them. The village is a small one, engaged in fishing : it is notable that the women take their share with the men in all the work of Hie boats and the disposal of the catch, in a way unusual in a Moslem coirnminity. Visits of warships are rare, and the villagers seemed to welcome the ship’s presence. |: t:\ 1 S S'-'V ' r \c x. &lt;&lt;T r O ANY FURTHER COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO TH* SECRETARY of the ADMIRALTY LONDON.

I exchanged calls, accompanied by Commander P.K*Snright, the Naval Officer-in-Charge, with Lieut-Commander Luang Janjayasuk, commanding the torpedo boat division, and on 7th April Lieut-Commander Luan Somboon,\ commanding 'ChandhaburiJ had luncheon with me. \ + + + + 4. I discussed the forthcoming Socotra and Protectorate coast cruise with H.E.Sir Bernard Reilly, who much regretted that it was impossible t o spare a Political Officer to accompany me: it was arranged, however, with the Air Officer Commanding that Flight Lieutenant A.C^P.Carver, who spoke Arabic and had done some local intelligence work, should come with me to act as such. The question was also raised of the possibility of paying a short call at Mukalla en route without unduly extending my programme, as the Governor attached importance at the present time to good political contact being maintained there, and I agreed to do so, vide my 0928/8 to Admiralty. 5. Having embarked Flight Lieutenant Carver, I sailed at 0800 8th April for Socotra. + + + + + + + ♦ 6. I anchored in 6 fathoms, 6 cables 355° from Tamrida Fort at 1330 10th, and the Port Officer, Paris bin Isma f il, came on board at once; he informed me that we were the first ship to visit the port since 'Defender** took the First Political Officer there in February 1936. I subsequently landed with Flight Lieutenant Carver, and visited the home of the leading merchant, a letter being sent up-country to the Sultan by camel. 7. Sultan , Ali bin Salim, ruler of the Mahra provinces of Qishn and Socotra, arrived in Tamrida at midday next day, and came off to call on me at 1600, accompanied by the Qadhi and a small retinue: he remained on board for an hour and a half, opportunity being taken to pay him, at the request of the Aden Government, Rs.400, being a 5 months* instalment of his subsidy. Following on complaints of his ill-health, my medical officer examined him, and found that he had had a recent and severe attack of pneumonia and was in a very precarious state of health; he was given medicines and advice as to diet and general care of himself. On leaving the ship, he was accorded a 9 gun salute. I returned his call, accompanied by Plight Lieutenant Carver and Surgeon Lieutenant D.W*Pratt, the following morning, 12th April; on this occasion he had his cousin and heir, Ahmed bin Abdulla, and his son, Yea bin Ali, with him.

I exchanged calls with Commander Charoen Rajanava of the Siamese yacht *Angthong rt senior officer of the squadron, and suggested to him that he might like to accompany me for my call on the Sultan; he politely declined, however, to establish any relation with the local authorities, though he did not give any reasons for this - apparently - somewhat discourteous attitude* The Wardroom officers also exchanged calls, and on 11th April four of the officers of’’Angthong**, including Prince Mom Chao Karajitphol Abhakara, dined on board ’’Weston*. 10# I sailed at 1100 12th April and ♦ * * + 4 anchored off qishn, 1#2 miles 120° from centre of Qishn village at 0950 15th. 11# The local representative of the dultan, Sheikh Ali, accompanied by the Qadhi (his brother-in-law) Mubarak Sa’id came on board at 1030, and subseqently Plight Lieutenant Carver and myself returned the visit at the Sheikh's house. It was the first visit of a ship of any kind to Qishn for two years, and a good deal of friendly interest was shewn in us by the inhabitants, who seemed healthy and of a good type. Qishn ISthAppL We then walked over to inspect the R*A.P#landing ground, wnich was marked out, after a certain amount of political pressure had been used, in 1933, but which had not been used recently; It was muddy after recent heavy rain - the first on that part of the coast for four or five years - but was otherwise in good condition# In view of our friendly reception and of a gift of thyme, for tea flavouring, having been made to me, I gave the Sheikh a present of a case of jams and preserved fruits, which were gratefully received# 12.

W. 1.HOPE IDA * 4th to 8 th January * 5. Mr*Saleh Jaffer and a representative party, consisting of the Director of Customs, Port Officer and two military officers, called on our arrival. Arrangements were made for me to land and call on the Deputy Governor the following morning. The high wind and sea of the previous day continued the next morning and landing by dhow was the only practicable way. This I did at 0930 accompanied by Lieutenant Commander Rowland. I was greeted on arrival by the Director of Customs, Captain of the Port and General Officer commanding A guard of honour of about 160 men were drawn up on the quay, and presented a much more soldierly appearance than on our previous visit. After inspecting the guard I proceeded by car to call on the Deputy Governor Kazi All Al-Ameri, the Governor Seiyid Abdullah A1 Wazir being away at Gaiza. 6. I was received with great cordiality by Kazi Ali Al-Ameri. He seemed genuinely pleased to welcome a British ship at Hodeida. A wide range of subjects were discussed, the chief interest in the outside world being the progress of the civil war in Spain, about which he was most eager for news. The situation in Palestine was not mentioned. 7. On parting the Deputy Governor arranged to repay my call on the following morning. On the conclusion of the visit, accompanied by Mr.Saleh Jaffer, we proceeded by car through the bazaar. A somewhat hazardous proceeding, streets being narrow and pedestrians and other impedimenta many. A call was paid at the house of Mr.Saleh Jaffer and the customary telegram sent to the King of the Yemen, later a call was paid on Mr.Brown, representative of Messrs. Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co., the only Englishman residing in the Yemen. 8. The difficulties of embarking and disembarking at Hodeida are becoming still more hazardous. So much has been said about the harbour that it is unnecessary to describe it again, but one does marvel at how heavy merchandise is landed. Cases up to a weight of 6 tons were lying on the quay. Dues have for some time been collected with a view to improving the harbour, but no steps are being taken to do so. A report that it was to be dredged is apparently incorrect. 9. The following morning the weather had fortunately moderated so it was possible to send the motor boat in for the Deputy Governor. He was accompanied by Salim Bey (G.O.C.Hodeida) Mahsin Galala (Port Officer) Haj Ahmed Al Garnozi (Director of Cue toms) and three children, a son and 2 nephews of Seiyid Abdullah Al Wazir, the latter three by special invitation. • ^ ^ ^ It was a most friendly visit, and again much interest was evinced in Spanish affairs. Very little was said about Palestine. Our visitors remained onboard for nearly one hour and it was only their fear that the wind would get up and spoil the passage shorewards that eventually made them withdraw. Luckily nothing of the sort occurred, in fact the next two days were calm, a most unusual occurrence at this time of year. A salute of 13 guns was fired on the departure of the Deputy Governor. x x X X /APE# PHOT ::CTC RATE PORTS . IS. Arrangements had been made with the Chief Commissioner, Men, to visit ports in the Aden Protectorate, and a provisional programme arranged, this programme being confirmed the ship sailed on Friday, 15th January, for Mukalla, arriving there at 0851 on l?th. 14. His Highness, the Sultan of Shlrh and Mukalla, was in resi dence, and accompanied by two officers an official call was paid during the forenoon. This call was returned in person by His Highness accompanied by his son during the afternoon. A salute of 11 guns was fired on his departure from the ship. Later a motor oar was placed at my disposal for a drive in the vicinity and in the evening, in company with two of my officers, I dined with the Sultan. During the afternoon the local Boy Scouts visited the ship, they came from the English school and arrived lustily singing the national Anthem. Ship sailed at £150 local time. 15. Arrived at Has ;usaiyir at 0900 and was greeted by the local Sheikh, with whom X landed later and made a tour of the village. This place has not been visited by a British ship for many years, and in fact is rarely visited even by a British official, being under the control of the Buitan of Mukalla. 16. The following morning the ship weighed and shifted berth a few miles to theWestward with a view to getting in touch with a Bedouir tribe at Asaai Al Faya, a village lying a little inland. This was successfully effected by landing from a skiff through the surf, and most of the inhabitants were present to receive us. Some account of the reason for visiting this place is given in Appendix I to this letter. 17. Weighed at noon and after a short call at Bal-haf during the morning of Wednesday, 20th, during which time the local Sheikh called and two cases of sickness were treated ashore, the ship sailed for Shuqra arriving there at 0930 on the 21st. 18. The present Sultan Hussein ibn Abdulla Al Fadll is a young man of 23, who succeeded his father about 8 months ago. He has already shown his quality in suppressing caravan raiding in his territory without British co-operation. His young brother, a very promising lad of about sixteen, paid the official call on the Sultan*s behalf, he having twt recently recovered from an operation. In the evening, accompanied by two officers, I landed and took tea with the Sultan and walked round the village before re-embarking. Sailed at 1850 and arrived at /Men at 0150 on 22nd January. - A ; A A nMAPI AL FAYA * (Charts No,6B and 10). In the Times of 21st December, 1936, a report appeared from the Times correspondent in Cairo that the Italians from Mogadishu had purchased the concession of the entire port of ,*ssadi el Fayel, on the coast of Arabia, from a Bedouin tribe claiming to be independent of any states in the Hadramaut, and thus hot bound by treaties to Great Britain. This report was authoritatively denied from Rome on the following day. The Chief Commissioner Aden had already satisfied himself of the falseness of the report but, as 'LONDONDERRY” was about to visit Aden protectorate ports, requested me to call at Qusaiyir, which was the nearest known place to As&amp;di A1 Faya, and, if possible, to identify the latter place whose position was not definitely known. The village of Asadi A1 Faya lies about five miles to the West of Qusaiyir, in an oasis about two miles from the shore. It is a Bedouin village, with a normal population of about 40 souls of mixed tribes, who make a livelihood by net fishing from the shore. During the sardine season, roughly the period of the S.W.Monsoon, numbers increase considerably. It is ihterritory controlled by the Sultan of Mukalla, but the inhabitants claim that this area belongs to a Sheikh of the Hamumi tribe, and they wish for direct dealing with the British Authorities. This is the same with a number of the tribes in the Aden protectorate, but is against the policy of government. There is anchorage in seven fathoms to the West of Has Qusaiyir, but the water shallows rapidly around the beach and a heavy surf runs even in the finest weather and landing is difficult. The possibility of its use as a harbour is not apparent, it being open to both N.E. and S.W.Monsoon. There are three small natural harbours on the point of Ras Qusaiyir, protected by reefs, but there is only room in each of these for a maximum of two or three dhows. Two of these lie to the West of the point and one to the East. The inhabitants of Qusaiyir are Mukalla men and generally at feud with the neighbouring Bedouin.NiV^Vn- ' h X?

On 2nd November, I attended the Resident^ visit of inspection to the College opened in April, 1935, for the sons of Chiefs from the Aden Protectorate, of whom there are now 19 there* The boys vary in age from 7 to 15, and even in so short a time show great progress in discipline and manners: the establishment somewhat resembles the Indian college at Ajmer, and the political authorities have considerable hopes of being able to exert a wholesome influence on these future Chiefs by this means. 21. I sailed from Perim at 2030, 13th November, and proceeded to carry out an anti-slavery patrol in the neighbourhood of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb during the first and middle watches, with the ship darkened except for blued lighting and with dimmed navigation lights. No sailing craft were encountered. 23. I arrived at Mocha roads at 0830, and came to single anchor in a position 10*5 cables 157° from Old Light Tower. A salute of 21 guns was fired on anchoring, and this was promptly returned by an old muzzle-loader in a semi-ruined fort on the foreshore. I sent an officer ashore during the forenoon to arrange calls, and at 1600 I went in, in a local dhow sent off by the Port Officer, accompanied by my Navigating Officer, to call on the Governor. I was ceremoniously received by a large guard, * 3farmed with a notably big proportion of new rifles, and had half an hour’s conversation with His Excellency Sayed Abbas Ahmed, the acting Governor, the Governor himself, Sayed Abdul Jahil, being absent in Ta # iz. 24, We were subsequently escorted round the town, including the market, by the military commandant before re-embarking.

Apparently there had been a persistent rumour in the Yemen to this effect# He showed a great interest in and knowledge of the general political situation in Europe, and was keen to know in what form the League of Hations - of which the Yemeni have no great opinion - could be made more effective. We parted on terms of cordial friendliness, with the Wezir expressing the desire to visit the ship on the following day should conditions of weather and mail day permit. * * * * 8 .

B. Hodeida, the chief port of the Yemen, had been visited several times by Had Sea Sloops this year. It had therefore been suggested that the other ports should be included In this cruise by way of a change* According to the records they have only very seldom been visited in the past* 3. The suggestion was warmly supported by the Chief Commissioner, Aden, who kindly approached the Imam on the subject and obtained from him a cordial response* 4. Mocha * (20th-22n&amp; June). Arrived at 1452 on the 20th. Saluted the country with 21 gun© on anchoring, having ascertain©a from Perim that this was expected and that the salute would oe returned. 6. The salute was returned by two field gun© which had evidently been brought down to the foreshore for the purpose. X 8. Neither here or at either of the other porta was there any question of quarantine restriction or examination of the hill of health. 9. On landing the next forenoon I was received by the harbourmaster and e guard of ten men under an Offic er. ^ This party escorted me with great o©xc.j-oriy u^ruagh ® town to the Governor’s residence* x x 11. Mi interesting half hour with the Jf on H ® samrito discuss the political and international ku^iio] , coneeming which he seemed remarkably well informed, out when opportunity offered I steered the conversation into more general channel*.^ evldeatly a f ee nn f -, however expr^sed thnt Great Britain had deserted Abbyssinia in her time oi and had not taken the strong action accessary Italian conquest. Explanations to the oontrarj through. interpreter were not easy*&lt;* 2 . n 1£* The Governor returned ay call the same afternoon and was quite pleased to be suitably entertained and shewn round the ship* He was saluted with seven guns on his departure♦ xxxxxxxxxxx 15. One * a chief impression of Mocha is of a scene of ancient desolation. For every house that is standing there seemed to be a dozen in ruins. It is a very old town and as generations go by and houses subside for lack of repair the debris Is permitted to lie undisturbed and fresh house© are built Mien necessary. The sight of the debris of years is somewhat depressing. 16. Very little trade was going on, but two or three dhow© coming and going to Aden, is sab, Berim or Ilodeida seemed to be the dally average. I don*t think that any large fortunes have been made by the Yemen merchants out of the war, although doubtless some of them have done reasonably well. We were rather astonished to be told that coffee was unobtainable in Mocha and that the so-called Mocha coffee was all shipped to Aden from Kodeida or else sent across country by camel caravans. 17. In Mocha, as in the other ports, I asked one or two fcasual questions about slavery. I was told that the trade was | completely dead and that no slaves were ever brought across the Red Sea no?/. ..ooheiya . (24th~25th June). Arrived off Loheiya about 1230 on' tne 24th. x x x x Fired a national salute, which was returned from the castle. x x xxxxxxxxxxx 20. I landed on the following forenoon and my reception with guards of honour etc*, was practically a repetition of what had taken place at Mocha. When it came to entertainment. however, I found that my host was the Sheikh, in whose presence the Governor seemed to take second place* It was unfortunate that there ms no opportunity for the Sheikh to visit the ©hip. 21. During my walk through Loheiya I was taken to the market and also saw the local school. The town 1© evidently the centre of a large district and a fair amount of trading was going on. The water front also presented a busy scene with several dhows under construction or repair. xxxxxxxxxxx 24. Loheiya is a larger and more active town than Mocha; the Governor and Sheikh both seemed to be men of energy and character and the town generally was less 5l6ex&gt;y* x x xxxxxx x x x x xm &lt;3 3* ^6* On landing the following forenoon I was received with, even .coore cereiaonj than at the other ports. The only siotor oar in the distriot, a Ford, was sent to fetch me from Mersa Bagla ana came out across the sands at low water to prevent anyone getting their feet wet j the guard at Mersa Bagla was about BO strong and the guard at Me&amp;i itself outside the Governor’s residence wasabout 150 strong with six trumpeters* 27. the similarity of the cerexiK&gt;nial reception© at all three ports gave rise to the suspicion that the Imam must have sent definite orders from Sana on the subject. £9*^ The conversation with the Governor was most interesting, particularly as one of the local merchants spoke English and was able to supplement the efforts of the ship’e'interpreter. The Governor had never been out of his coma try but was a native of Sana and apparently a personal friend of the Imam* Medi was less affected by the war than the other ports, being further north and having less sea-borne trade* 30* fhe Governor with a large suite and personal bodyguard returned my call the same afternoon* x X X X M, Although these visits were rather formal I think we can claim that they were quite successful* The official© we met were quite dignified and most courteous and did all in their power to welcome and entertain us. Some of the Officers also managed to get on quite friendly terms with the harbourmasters and less important fry. 33. from a political point of view one’s chief impression was that the Yemen have been looking aghast at the conquest of Abyssinia and were determined to cultivate the good offices of Great Britain to the full extent of their ability as a preventative against any similar Italian incursions into their country. This impression was gained from many polite speeches and phrases. One has only to inspect the guards of honour, composed as they are of ; armed bandits, to realise that they could, of course, put up no sort of opposition to the weapons of modern warfare. 34. On the other hand 1 heard nothing to suggest that Italian interest in the Yemen is on the increase. x X Sd* • $. .ongsdon ♦ Gommaml e r-in -0 ommand*EXTRACTS. % XQQO U U 4 . 1936 Hodeida&gt; 15th-16th April. i 'sauted the country with 21 guns on anchoring, the aaluto being returned by the fort. Shortly after anchoring, Mr. Saleh Jaffer, M.B.E., the Political Clerk, accompanied by the Captain of the Port, the Military Commandant, and a member of the Governor’s suite, came off to call on me, and I made the necessary arrangements with him for calling on the Governor next morning*. At 0930 on 14th April I landed, accompanied by my Surgeon Lieutenant, and having inspected the band and the guard of honour, some 200 strong, drawn up on the quay, proceeded to call on His Excellency Sayid Abdulla, the Wazir. He received me with marked friendliness, and after the usual interchange of compliments, we discussed, through the medium of Mr. Saleh Jaffer, the Abyssinian situation, regarding which I was able to give him the latest wireless press infomation. I invited him to visit the ship next day, and he accepted, with a reservation regarding his weak state of health - which did, in the event, prevent his coming. Although there was no necessity for him to return my call in person, there was reason to think that he did intend to come, and that his indisposition was not entirely a diplomatic one. I landed later the same day and lunched with Mr.Brown, the local representative of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., and was taken round the bazaars and the town by Mr. Saleh Jaffer. It seems clear that the Yemini Government are doing very little to improve the condition of the town or of its port facilities: the existing boat 'harbour” is an admirable example of work half-heartedly undertaken, not completed, and subsequently allowed to take care of itself. With a moderate 8.S.Westerly wind and sea, it was impossible to use a motor boat for landing, and all merchandise has to be handled in the surf by Arab boys swimming or wading, to its frequent detriment - and this despite the levy of a considerable tax on the local merchants specially for the improvement of the port: it is unnecessary to remark that none of this tax has, up to date, got further than the treasury at San’a. I was struck by the absence of any white British representative in the Yemen, particularly, perhaps, on account of the increasing number of Italian semi-official residents. X XXX At 0900 on 15th April, my call was returned by the Wazi’s Secretary, Kazi Ali al Amri, and a number of officials, accompanied by Mr. Saleh Jaffer. X XXX The Wazir, as on previous occasions of sloop visits, sent off a present of meat, vegetables and fruit to the ship, and a suitable gift of jams, tinned fruits, and orange squash was despatched in return. x X X Xany rimi-ttifs ^jBNtCATION SH0UJ.0 t, ee addhesbeo to- THE SECRETARY &lt;rf THE ADMIRALTY LONDON. 8.W.I. &amp; THE FOLLOW I NO LETTER &amp; NUMBER SHOULD 6S QUOTED,’- M.02268/36.

HODEIDA• ■ ai Ml HI ir ■ TI-I* III--I Vp/ Arrived at Hodeida at 0940 on 5th Decerriber and anchored in the roadstead after saluting the Yemen Flag with 21 guns. The salute was returned by the shore battery. Mr. Saleh Jaffer, M.B.E., the British Political Clerk, called to welcome the ship accompanied by one of the Amir s suite and by the Port Officer, who had been appointed to that post last year as a reward for his efficiency as the Royal Barber. 9 . The officials were evidently somewhat perturbed at the sudden arrival of the ship at short notice, particularly during the Ramadam fast; they were anxious to know whether rtended I assured them to the contrary 'in Wrtjr^r Toi^n^Sf 36 -- Sloops to drop into these ports from time to time with no particular object in view as this disabused the natives of the idea that the presence of a-man-of-war necessarily meant trouble. nd 10* My call on the Amir was arranged for 1600 on the same afternoon. I landed in a dhow provided by the Government and w r as received on the jetty by a guard of honour. A.ccompanied by Saleh Jaffer I drove to the Palace in the only car in the tom not under repair and was received by His Excellency the Amir, Seyyid Abdullah A1 Wazir, with every sign of genuine pleasure and friendliness. 11. I understand the Amir has only once been outside his country and then only as far as Mecca. Nevertheless he discussed European politics with great interest and was very anxious for my opinion on the relations between Prance, Germany and Italy vis-a-vis the present situation. I gather that he obtains most of his information from Egyptian news- naners but his conversation was entirely that of a cultured and well-read man of the world. Altogether interesting^ d ana we±x-reau mem ux 7 “ . . ^ lately in Abyssinia 12. Subsequently I visited Saleh Jaffer's house and also called on Mr. Mackintosh, the representative of Messrs, Gallatly, Hankey &amp; Co., and the only Englishman living in Hodeida. We were glad to relieve Mr. Mackintosh s lonely life by entertaining him onboard on the following day. The Yemeni Government apparently subject him to a series of petty restrictions, which are very galling for a white in an Arab country. Even to come off to the ship he had to obtain a pemit from the Amir to leave the tom and his private 'cellar” is kept by the Customs authorities, who allow him to draw out monthly what they consider a suitable allowance. Being Mohammedans they do not take a very generous view of an Englishman’s requirements and Mr. Mackintosh is restricted to four bottles of beer a month. 13. However, although I was interested from the point of view of the local prestige of an English representa tive, it appears that the situation has Been accepted for some time and unless Messrs. Gallatly, Hankey make a complaint I do not see that anything can ^ e + ^ n ? i , T .m with matter touches the commercial relations of the tirm with the Yemeni Government. 14. I■A- 14. My official call, was returned at 0900 on the following day hy the Amir’s Secretary, who is a brother of the Prime Minister. He refused any hospitality owing to the Ramadam fast but much enjoyed being shown round the ship. 15. I landed again unofficially on the afternoon of the 6 th and took a walk round the town escorted by Saleh Jaffer. Although very primitive it is not so dirty as might be expected and I was told that the present Yemeni Government have made considerable improvement in this respect. It is to be hoped that something will be done before long to improve the landing facilities. The Disadvantages of an open roadstead cannot be helped, except perhaps by elaborate works and expensive dredging, but a more efficient pier would not be hard to erect and this would avoid the indignity of every visitor to the Yemen being carried ashore on a chair through the surf. 16. Although I had long conversations with Saleh Jaffer, Mr. Mackintosh and others I heard little of political interest and my impression was that everything was completely quiescent. x x x. Everyone was closely watching the situation in Abyssinia, anxious that the Yemen should preserve a strict neutrality and not become involved.

XX XX 2. The Commanding Officer, H.M.S. BIDEFORD, has Been instructed to forward this flag to the Naval Officer-in- Charge, Aden, for retention and issue to H.M.Ships visiting Shehr and Mukalla in normal circumstances, since it was made to the design of His Highness the Sultan. F.F.Rose (Signed). Vice Admiral, East Indies, Commander-in-Chief. 28th A ril, 19*36. XX XX His Highness the Sultan Salab Bin Galab Alkaity Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, came aboard H.M.S. BIDEFORD at 0916 on 14th April, 1936. He was accompanied by his son. Prince Sultan Amad Bin Sultan Galab, his Political Minister and Secretary in India, Khan Bahadar Shaik Ali Baakza, J.P., his Personal Secretary, Nawab Ahmed Beg Khan (a relative of His Highness), his Aide de Camp, Mosin Bin Syead, an Arabic clerk and five servants. 2 . A Guard was paraded when His Highness came aboard and the usual marks of respect were paid. At 0930 H.M.S. BIDEFORD sailed for Mukalla. 3. Two cabins had been allotted to His Highness and his son, and the after end of the Quarter Deck screened off for the remainder of the party. His Highness and Personal Staff, however, had other ideas as to what they required, and annexed the after end of the Boat Deck for use by day, and slept within the enclosure on the Quarter Deck by night. XX XX His Highness, his son and the three Personal Staff messed with me, the remainder feeding on the Quarter Deck. XX XX 5. The ship anchored off Mukalla at 1705 on 15th April, 1936, A great number of native boats came out to welcome His Highness, while the shore was lined with thousands of people. A Guard was araded when His Highness left the ship and a salute of eleven guns fired. A flag of suitable size has been made on board during the passage to His Higmess's design, and was flown when the boat went ashore. This flag consisted of a green Star and Crescent on a red background. It was noticed, however, that all the flags flown ashore at Mukalla were the usual plain red Mohommedan flag. When he arrived ashore His Highness received an enthusiastic welcome. A saluting gun ashore fired a slow eleven-gun salute and a great crowd followed his car to the Palace. 6 . Before leaving the ship, His Highness had asked if I would dine informally with him that evening and bring as-'4 as many of my officers as possible* Pour officers and myself landed at 1930 and were met by two cars, in which we were driven to the Palace* The streets were lined with people and police were stationed every fifty yards, blowing whistles to clear the streets* Several police detachments turned out and presented arms as we passed. On arriving at the Palace I was surprised to find a Guard of about fifty file and a Band drawn up in charge of an Indian Army Instructor. Several regiments appeared to be represented. A salute was played and I then inspected the guard, who were extremely smart. In spite of the fact that the Palace had been unoccupied while His Highness was away, it was in good order and luxuriously furnished. After dinner, which was served in the European manner, and the usual formalities, my officers and I were driven back to the landing place, the police detachments again turning out and even the meanest inhabitant standing up and salaaming as we passed. 7. The Ship’s Company were landed in two parties next morning to see round the town, at 0630 and 0830. Cars were put at their disposal by His Highness. Three officers also landed and were shown round by His Highness’s Doctor. 8 . H.M.S. BIDBF0RD sailed for Aden at Noon on 16th April, 1936 and arrived at 1630 on 17th April, 1936. 9 . I was informed that Mukalla has a population of about 30,000 and that His Highness maintains a standing army of 2000 infantry and also a cavalry regiment. Mukalla has also a large and apparently efficient police force. The natives appear extremely loyal and contented. A Wireless Station has recently been built, but, though complete, is not yet in eomramission. The Palane alone is lit by Electric Light, but a large plant has been ordered from England and in the near future it is hoped to light the entire town by electricity.

Business in the town appears to be flourishing; the bazaar is full and active, while the inhabitants present a remarkably cheerful and well-fed appearance, the latter in marked contrast to that observed in most South Arabian ports. It is understood that the construction of the motor road to the HADRAMAUT, referred to in previous Reports of proceedings, has made little, if any, progress in the mountain districts. 15 On the 23rd I visited the English School, by the invitation of the Indian Schoolmaster, IBRAHIM SOCOAN, who for many years had taught in the Danish Mission School in The Crater, ADEN. The school, which was established some 6 months ago by the Sultan, is now attended three times weekly by about 60 boys, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years, of whom a third are Indians. + After the inspection of the Guard ol Boy Scouts, an Address of Welcome was read by the senior student, and wa8 followed by a demonstration of the principal subjects ° proceedings terminated by the singing, with much zest, of the National Anthem, first in English and then in In a short speech I congratulated the Schoolmaster and/2 A ADEN and his pupils on the results achieved in so short a time, and laid emphasis on the great value and universal appeal of the Boy Scouts’ Movement. Xn the evening the Schoolmaster and nine of the senior Scouts came onboard and. were shown round the ship. 16. It had been arranged with the Chief Commissioner that a short visit should be paid to BAL HAF while on passage to ADEN (BIK ALI was not included, as the Sheikh is at present in bad odour), but on the receipt of instructions (Admiralty message timed 1416/20) that Their Lordships were to be kept informed of the details of the reception ceremonies proposed for the forthcoming visit of His Majesty the King of ITALY to ADEN, it became necessary to allow a larger margin of time for consulting the chief Commissioner and transmitting the required intelligence. With his concurrence, BAL HAF was therefore omitted from the programme, and ’’PENZANCE” sailed at 0416 on the 24th for ADEN direct, arriving at 0700 on the following day. 17. The forthcoming visit of H.M. The King of ITALY was immediately discussed with the Chief Commissioner, when it was found that some uncertainty prevailed as to the policy which should be adopted for his reception. On the one hand a telegram from the Secretary of State for India (No.2466 - the equivalent of Admiralty message timed 1416/20) indicated the pleasure of His Britannic Majesty to be that full honours and compliments should be rendered, whether his Majesty was travelling incognito or otherwise, provided that his Standard was flying, while a further message (No.2484) stated that such would be the case* On the other hand, the Italian Consul had received information that the Standard would not be flown, and that His Majesty desired to land privately. He was therefore requested to obtain confirmation of this fact, pointing out that it was at variance with the information received from LONDON, and to state that should the Standard not be flown, no royal honours would be accorded. ('PENZANCE’S” message timed 2132/25). 18. On the following day (26th) the Secretary of State informed the chief Commissioner (telegram No. 2521) that no notification had been received of any change in the King’s plans. Further passages in the message were taken to indicate that the intimation that the Standard would be flown had originated from His Majesty and had been accompanied by a personal letter of thanks to His Britannic Majesty. , ^ „ ory ,. This message was followed and reinforced on c rth by a further one (No.2537), stating that information fro® His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at ROME was to the effect that Italian officials stated that it was His Majesty’s invariable practice to fly his Standard, and that, in their opinion, tne Italian Consul had been misinformed. It was considered by the Embassy tnat Italian wishes would be met by the reception of Kis Majesty with a gun salute, and that, as he wished his visit to be private, he should be spared all unnecessary ceremony ashore, other than the parading of a Guard of Honour. ^ ^ ^ ^ On the same day, however, the Consul obtained a positive statement from the Loyal Yacht that the btandard would not be flown. As this was in answer to the enquiries referred/referred to in paragraph 17, it was held to constitute a clear indication that His Majesty did not desire to he received with any ceremony, and the Consul was therefore asked to state that in deference to these wishes honours would not he rendered. The main situation thus appeared to he clear, and was reported in my message timed 1237/27. 19. A minor complication, however, arose from the fact that at a kesiaency Meeting that evening (27th) the Consul announced that the escorting cruiser n 0OElZIA rt was flying the flag of Admiral of Division CONTE LUIGI MIRAGLIA. In the absence of the Royal Standard it appeared to me evident that his flag should he saluted hy n RLN2ANCE ,&lt; , although the presence of His Majesty, admittedly in a private capacity, made such a procedure appear somewhat illogical unless what I take to he the strict interpretation of the situation, viz., that in the absence of the Standard, His Majesty was not, from a ceremonial aspect, present in the yacht, was constantly home in mind. The Consul was therefore asked to ascertain the wishes of the Rear Admiral as regards the marks of respect to he paid to him and I reported the matter in my message timed 0107/28, receiving in reply Admiralty message 1352/28. 20. On the evening of the 28th I was summoned to a further conference at the Residency at which the Chief Commissioner quoted three further messages received during that day from the Secretary of State (Nos.2541, 2542 and 2554). These were to the effect that the earlier reports that the standard would not he flown has caused considerable surprise in LONDON and that His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at ROME had notified that the Master of Ceremonies, in a personal interview, had again emphasised that His Majesty invariably flew his Standard and would expect gun salutes, and, if he landed, a Guard of Honour, notwithstanding that his visit was of a private nature. 21. influenced hy these repeated expressions of the opinions held hy LONDON and ROME as to His Majesty’s wishes, and taking into account the complication referred to in paragraph 19, (particularly as regards its effect on the large native population of ADEN who, being unable to appreciate the circumstances of an unofficial visit, would regard the omission of Royal honours as most unusual), it was decided that full compliments should he paid, it being held that in the unusual circumstances of a Sovereign paying a visit to a foreign military port of a status such as that of ADEN, without flying his Standard although under naval escort, an excess of ceremony was to he preferred to a deficiency. ^ , . In his advance message ol Welcome which he sent that evening, Sir BERNARD REILLY therefore stated his desire to render the usual honours on the arrival of the Yacht, unless the King desired to the contrary, to which His Majesty replied with an expression of thanks. Apart from the fact that it was evidently impossible for B.M. Ship under my command not to fire a Royal Salute when the military forces were rendering this honour, hut instead to salute the flag of the Rear Admiral, I myself concurred in the decision recorded above. The rendering of other naval honours, in my opinion, followed as/4 as a necessary corollary, and arrangements were therefore made to dress ship, man ship, and cheer. It will he appreciated that these decisions taken only a few hours before the expected arrival of His Majesty could not under the circumstances he submitted to Their Lordships for prior approval. Monday, 29th October . 22. H.M. 8 . 'PENZANCE 8 , the military signal stations and merchant vessels in port dressed ship overall at 0800. On approaching the Fairway Buoy 'OOHISIA' saluted the Country, which was returned by the MAEBUT Battery. The Koyal Yacht 'SAVOIA', followed by 'OORIZIA' entered the Inner Harbour at 1330, when a Royal Salute, synchronised by Y/S signals, was fired by 'PENZANCE' and the shore battery. On the near approach of 'SAVOIA', 'PENZANCE' manned ship, rendered military honours and cheered ship. 'SAVOIA' proceeded to No.4 buoy, head west, and was thus in close proximity to 'PENZANCE' (No.2 buoy, head east), while 'CORIZIA' proceeded to No.2 fuelling berth, military honours being paid by 'PENZANCE' as she passed. The Royal Standard was not flying, neither was it hoisted at any time throughout the visit. As far as could be seen, no marks of respect were rendered by 'GORIZIA' when passing the Yacht, either on entering harbour or on departure. 23. The Chief Commissioner, flying his Flag and accompanied by Group Captain C.F*A.PORTAL, B.S.O*, M.G., (Officer Commanding British Forces), proceeded at once onboard 'SAVOIA' to offer his respects and welcome to His aiesty* In the evening, Sir BERNARD REILLY, the Group Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel N.M.McLEQD (Commanding British Troops) and the Aide de Camp had the honour of dining with His Majesty; these Invitations had been issued by the Consul. 24. Before the operation of securing was completed the Officer of the Guard from 'GORIZIA' called on me (having passed 'PENZANCE’S' Officer of the Guard between the two ships) and presented a reguest from Rear Admiral Conte LUIGI MIRAGLIA that in view of the short duration of the stay I should refrain from calling on him. 25. A police boat patrolled round the Yacht during the whole of the visit. Tuesday, 50th October . 26. As on the preceding day, 'PENZANCE', the shore signal stations and merchant shipping dressed ship overall at 0800. ^ n ^ His Majesty landed at the Prince of bales’ Pier at 0700, and was received with a Royal Guard provided by the British troops and Royal Air Force. A field battery of the Royal Artillery was temporarily sited on the Post Office pier, and fired a Royal Salute as His Majesty stepped ashore. 'PENZANCE' mounted a Guard of Honour, but no ceremony was observed in 'GORIZXA'. 27. After/27. After inspecting the Guard, His Majesty accompanied hy his suite and hy the Chief Commissioner and certain British officials made a tour of the town hy car, visiting first the Tanks in the Crater and then proceeding to the Italian Salt Works where the Italian staff were presented. Here His Majesty displayed his remarkable memory when, on being informed of the regiments in which certain members of the staff had fought during the Great War, he recalled in many instances the names of the Commanding Officers. The Settlements Gardens at SHEIKH QTHMAN were then inspected, after which the procession returned to the Residency. Here a number of other officers and officials, among them myself, had tne honour of being presented to His Majesty, with each of whom he found time to have a short conversation. His Majesty speaks excellent English. After light refreshments His Majesty re-embarked, the Guard of Honour being now provided by the Aden Levies. A Royal Salute was again fired by the field battery. ’’PENZANCE’S” guard paraded, and on this occasion it appeared that a Guard was also mounted in ’’GORIZIA”, although elsewhere the work of the ship proceeded without apparent interruption. 28. ’’GORIZIA” proceeded to sea at 1150, followed by ”3AV0IA” at 1210. As the Yacht passed w PENZANCE^ the same honours were rendered as on her arrival, and as she reached the entrance to the inner Harbour, Royal Salutes were fired by the ship and MARBUT battery. 29. The Chief Commissioner infoms me that from his bearing and general demeanour throughout the visit he is confident that His Majesty was genuinely pleased with the arrangements made for his reception; this opinion was fully confirmed by subsequent reports from the Consul, to whom His Majesty and leading members of his entourage had expressed their complete satisfaction. Sir Bernard has since received a telegram from LONDON, expressing His majesty’s Government’s approval of the arrangements made, and congratulating him on his tactful handling of the situation. ♦ ##*** I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (sgd.)

That night four officers and myself dined with His Highness the Sultan, and were entertained to a cinema show afterwards. A searchlight display was given after dark. 36. Early the next morning Plis Highness the Sultan sent a present of four live goats, eight tins of honey and four bunches of bananas. The Sultan was very interested in visiting the ship, and did all he could by placing cars at our disposal to make our stay agreeable. The Sultan is half Indian and well informed.

On arrival, a native, who stated he was the 'harbour master', came off and said they had not been notified of our visit (actually the letter announcing our arrival was brought to us from Mukalla) and that His Highness the Sultan was in the hills. I accordingly arranged to meet the Sultan ashore at 1600 that afternoon, which was done. 40. The Sultan had nothing to report and had not been visited by any other warships or merchant ships. I particularly asked him if any Italians had visited Socotra, which he said was not so. 1 did this as, at Aden I was told that sometime ago Italians from /Somaliland The Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station.TuStt, 2 . Somaliland had been there and were thought to be surveying. The Sultan and his loll owing are of a level of civilisation similar to the Sheik at Sharjah. The usual courtesies were exchanged in the Audience House, at which I was received with a series of detonations on arrival by the guard firing their rifles. I asked the Sultan if he would like to visit the ship but he excused himself as it was getting late. 41. After giving a searchlight display, the ship left for Lamu at 2010. Just prior to leaving, Hig Highness the Sultan sent off a present of two live sheep, for which I returned a present of tea, sweets and cigarettes. I also gave the “harbour master” a small present in reply to his request for “bac Sheesh', the only word of practical value he seemed to know. I took a letter for the Sultan for transmission to Aden. x x x x x I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) C.E.B. Simeon.

Should Hodeida be evacuated by Saudis* either in fulfilment of peace terms* or from necessity, a period of lawlessness would probably ensue as before. The presence of a British ship is necessary both for protection of British subjects and because the Italians would certainly land and not readily evacuate unless acting in co-operation with the British. S3. In the event of a Saudi evacuation or retreat, the tribes who had originally risen in their favour might well turn against them* causing an influx ot armed parties into Kamaran as before* but possibly not so exhausted or peacefully inclined. There is a further possibility of raids should chaos develop on tae mainland.

The attached report from H.M.

The situation was extremely delicate for the first few days, but the Commander of H.M.S. PENZANCE seems, on the whole, to have acted rightly, in the circumstances explained in his report, in landing an armed observation post only, consisting of a Lewis Gun section accompanied by a signaller (page 6 ).

The Italians, however, who arrived later, were not viewed with much favour and they were foolish enough to attempt to land a large armed force after the town had been occupied by the Saudis, thus exposing themselves to a somewhat ignominious rebuff, since the Saudi officials refused to allow them permission to proceed further than the pier (page 16). y The Commander of H.M.S.PENZANCE praiseS the conduct of Saleh Jaffer, the British Political Clerk, and of Mr. A.F.Bay of Messrs.

(d) At about 1700/30th tribesmen from the surrounding districts, (believed to be mainly of the RAbAoA tribe) entered the town and after being joined by some oi the local riffraff, proceeded to break into the Government godowns, whence they looted 500-600 rifles and large quantities of ammunition and foodstufis.

X stated that, with the small force at my disposal, I was prepared to do all in my power to prevent looting on the scale that had occurred during the previous night, but that anything in the nature of a concerted attack by tribesmen in force would be beyond my resources to resist* In this event I should assist the evacuation of British subjects to the full extent of my power, but X could take no sort of responsibility for the protection of property. 11. « Throughout the night at intervals there were bursts of rifle fire, and on one occasion, the firing of a machine gun, but the pre-arranged emergency signal was not given* The searchlight was burnt at frequent Intervals. 12. - s/s tf J EAIGIH** {Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company) arrived at 1600/1, having cargo to discharge. This was Impossible owing to the situation ashore, but X informed the Master that 1 considered he should remain at HOD IDA as a means of evacuation.

Fag© 5. 14* - {Continued )• concemtratlon of tribesmen in the neigbbourtiood* All had been quiet, however, in the town during the past night, though to buoy up their spirits the inhabitants had occasionally indulged in bnrsts of rifle fire* 15. - We discussed carefully the question of evacuating the British subjects and Europeans, and 1 then formed the opinion that such an operation was Impracticable at that time* Uhe whole confidence and spirit of the town is centred in the foreign community, whose presence is regarded as the only guarantee of the protection of the British and, to a lesser extent, of other foreign Governments* So strongly is this view held that Mr. Bay stated his firm conviction that any attempt to remove these communities would result in very serious rioting which would be far beyond the resources at my disposal to control* neither was It considered feasible to effect a preliminary concentration of the community - which is scattered through the town - without at once arousing the alarm of the native population, with the same result* 16* * A further argument against evacuation are the difficulties attending an embarkation. Very few dhows are available in the small harbour and of these the majority of the crews have left and are in their homes. Direct communication from shore to dhow is only possible at high water; at other times it is necessary either to wade up to the waist or to be carried. 17. - the extent of the danger of attack was extremely difficult to estimate. If the news that the rich prize of HOD IDA was undefended reached the ears of turbulant tribes, the possibility of raids on a large scale appeared by no means remote* Smaller raids were, however, more probable, as the co-operation between raiders necessary to stag© an attack on a really large scale Is contrary to normal tribal customs. 18* - My appreciation was therefore that the safety of the lives and property of British and other foreign subjects could only be assured with certainty by the presence of a force sufficient to repel a large raid, amounting to a general attack on the town. in my message timed 0832 /2 X therefore proposed the Immediate despatch of troops from ADW (whose actual landing would depend on circumstances), and the carrying out of air demonstrations over the town and neighbourhood. Ihe presence of other warships was also much to be desired and, being aware that the nearest British ship was at least 1,000 miles distant, 1 proposed reference to the Italian Government, who, in addition to other considera tions, have some 60 subjects in HOD IDA, from one of whom I had already passed a telegram to ASMARA asking for Immediate help. 19.24 Pag© 6 » WEDNESDAY - MB MAT* 19. - As regards smaller raids, 1 considered that the landing of a fighting force from the ship should only toe undertaken in a case of the gravest emergency, and that th© task of repulsing such attacks was primarily the responsibility of the townsfolk* For them to do this duly with efficiency and rolatoility the first essential appeared to be the restoration of public morale, and my immediate efforts were therefor© directed to this end* 20. « Mr. Bay concurred in my views and on his departure undertook to do all in his power to impress the British residents in general with the fact that the gravity of the situation was fully recognised, and that steps ware toeing taken to meet all emergencies* gi* - Mr. Bay returned shortly after noon, and 1 then discussed with him the desirability of establishing an armed signal station and observation post ashore* The uncertainties of the previous evening, during which rifle fire and machine gun fire had been heard at intervals, convinced me that quick and reliable information would be of the greatest value, and might lead to the avoidance of a landing to which 1 might otherwise be committed by an ill-judged use of the existing emergency signal. On the other liadd it was clear that, once a party was established ashore, its withdrawal without giving rise to rumours and perhaps to panic, would be a matter of extreme difficulty. | On the balance, I decided in favour of landing, | and accordingly sent ashore a Lewis Gun Section under the Command of Mr. W. H. Curtis, Gunner, Royal Mavy, I accompanied by a signalman and a Somali rating, as interpreter. My Navigating Officer also landed to supervise their installation. 22* - On arrival onshore the party proceeded in the lorry round the outskirts of the town, finally occupying the flat parapeted roof of tte highest house'in the town, the property of a British Indian subject* From her© an excellent all-round view of the' surrounding country was obtained, making It suitable also as an ^O.F. R should a bombardment become necessary. The appropriate stores had been included in the equipment of the party. 23. - The general reception of the seamen by the inhabitants was excellent, and it was clear that increased confidence resulted from their presence.mmm* Page 7* Puriig the day 8 ,'Xi.iii'I JAF.FBii handed to me a Memoranda from the British community (Appendix I)* to which I replied verbally that the situation was in hand# and that l would receive the© personally at the first opportunity* I also received an appeal from the *Town Council ,f of HOBIIBAf requesting the protection of His Majesty s Government* (Appendix XI* Arabic original to ADBH)• this I sent a verbal and non-committal answer* stating the measures already undertaken and emphasising that His Majesty’s Government were in full possession of the facts of the situation* (Reported in my message 1431/L; * fhe authority of the signatories to speak in the name of their fellow citizens was subsequently confirmed in a document purporting to be in the native equivalent of a Bswer of Attorney* bearing 29 signatures* (Appendix III* Arabic original to ABM) • 05*- In the afternoon SALBHL JAW&amp;R informed me that Sheikhs of certain sections of the ASH SMAMX BARABIK and JAHM tribes had presented a petition for the protection of the British flag.

Although their uncalled for display of aggressiveness during the previous night -^undertaken without reference to me - (see paragraph 52 and my message 1449/5) gave me no reason for regarding such a pre liearnest with much sympathy, I arrived (with some reluctance5 at the conclusion that the msinteaance of a spirit of co-operation would fee more in ©eeordasB# with diplomatic requirements* (message 1716/5).65.—*.««**»•*» S E C B f Peg© 14* I therefore decided against iMaediate evaeuation penaing Admirait y inat rue tIons * 58♦ Captain BOHEffI also informed me that the force under embarkation in w OSftA w at MASSAviA (see paragraph 49) was 100 men instead of the 400 originally quoted. 59* I also brought to the notice of captain BQgKffX the Italian occupation of the EAlLa'A House referred to in paragraph 52, and requested the withdrawal of his f uard* to this he at once agreed, expressing regret or what he assumed was a mistake on the part of the Offleer Com anding t he land lag fart y* It was not however* until the evening, and after a further request (In writing) on my part, that the Italians departed.

I asked him the reason for the large numbers of soldiers which he was landing, in comparison with the officers and 35 ratings who comprised his naval force ashore, to which he replied that he considered it preferable not to divide up the normal military organisetion. I enquired whether the concurrence of the sa» udi administration had first been obtained, but was informed that the urgency of the orders had not permitted of this preliminary. It will be realised that the sequence of events prevented me from acting on the instructions contained in Admiralty message timed 2245/5, and, the incident having already taken place, I contented myself with expressing my deep concern and in requesting that I might be kept fully informed of future developments. 73*- At 0845 asp tain BQRffX himself landed to explain his act lorn to the Sa* udi Commander; the Amir FA TSAI did not, however, receive him personally, but was represented at the interview by hi© advisor, ABDULLAH AL-KA^T* fhrough a friend of the British Ooverment Clerk who was present at the meeting, I learn that ABBUlhAH exp re© Bed his surprise and concern at the unannounced landing of the troops, which in his opinion would have a most disturbing effect in the town.

Sir, 18. Considerable operational activity has been displayed by the Boyal ^ir Force at duxing the month, in the course of which a new system of .dr Control has been tested for the first time in the Irotectorate. The system aims at establishing a 'blockade' of the territory of a transgressing tribe, as opposed to the previous method of inflicting definite material damage on their property as a direct punishment for Tuisc!.©* The blockade order forbids the tribe to occupj their Tillages to cultiYate their crops or to graze their livestock until the demands of the Government for the surrender of the criminals and the payment of a fine have been satisfied* It is enforced by air patrols at irregular intervals, who, if they see cultivators at work or flocks in the fields, attack with machine guns, and occasionally bomb the outskirts of villages. The effect of this pressure is that the entire tribe, with their animals,are forced to retire in acute discomfort into the caves and galleys of the mountains, while their normal means of livelihood are completely suspended. at the present time the JJTklBl tribe - well known as one of the most unruly and obstinate in the Protectorate - are the defaulters, road guards in one of their valleys having attacked and looted a passing caravan* The blockade has been in force since the 22nd March, but up to the 25th ^pril there were no signs of surrender. e.JIDI - ..JbiBIA - . YP^ IGSlILITIia* 19. * On 25th the Political S ecretary returned by air from a visit to LalLiMi, and brought intelligence of the heavy influx of pilgrims from the towns of taiDI and LQHIT vE, caused by the advance to the southv&lt;arci oj. the w a udi or ^ e |gp U (;ation of merchants also informed the Chief Commissioner that they had received news irom SEDI that the Governor was preventing the departure ot British subjects, women and children only being allowed to leave, while men and all property were being detainee. ^fter consultation with tne Chief 6ommisoioner it was therefore decided that PEESi®! shoi^l sail at once for LJL-Jlii, and, if the detention oi subjects was confirmed, should endeavour to get into /touchlift ^S u ?^TT?i%\^ e .^ emen ^ Oovemor of MIDI (and if necessary ©f IDHIx-iH) and urge Mm to lifi these restrictions. The ship therefore left harbour at 1E15 at 12 knots, in order to arrive before dark on the following day. * * * 20. - During the night of the 25th-26th ^pril an intercepted message from KJLJLD stated that Xemeni troops were to be embarked at HOPS Ilk in a ship of Messrs. OQTkSJH DIIiSHi® brothers for conveyance to MIDI. The name of the ship in question was known, but as she was not equipped with W/x it was decided to close her off HGBIIDu and inform her that this unneutral service should not be undertaken; aBW was informed of this intention. 21. - On approaching HOlEIDa the ship OkXJIGM*! 11 ) was seen to be in harbour; therefore entered the anchorage, fired a salute to the Yemeni flag, and anchored. t l4JSUMfI tf was at once boarded,'and the situation explained to the Master. Ho troops had as yet been embarked, but an enquiry for freight haa been made and the Master was considering his reply. During the absence of the boarding officer, a signal was intercepted from aBM which contained definite instructions from the Owners that, under the orders of the British authorities, the transport of troops or munitions was on no account to be undertaken. This confirmation of K£©jiM&gt;I , s instructions was at once communicated to the Master, who received it with some relief. 22. - The BritishiiGoverament ...gent and the Port Officer visited the ship soon after anchoring. It was explained to the latter that an important message had to be delivered to alkMOITTl, ?diile regret was expressed that notification of the arrival of iMkiHOB had not been possible in advance. These explanations were well received, and an invitation was extended to make a further and longer stay at the first opportunity. 23. ESESiKOB sailed again at 1530, speed being increased to 14 knots to make the landfall in daylight. iUichored at KAMMS at 1845. 24. The situation was fully discussed with the Civil administrator in the light of the information which he had collected from refugees. The first refugees to arrive in the island were irom MIDI, to a number of 20 males and 200old men, women and children; of these the last party had landed on the 17th, from which it was to be presumed that the ban on departures had become effective on the 16 th. It v/as reported that the MSDI authorities had removed the rudders from all dhows in order to prevent their sailing. From the personal knowledge of the administrator and his staff, it was estimated that there remained in MEDI some 36 families of British or British protected subjects, with goods to the value of about 20,000 M.T. dollars. 25. Reliable information indicated that the tom, although strongly invested by the Sa f udi forces on the north, south and east, had not fallen on the 24th.^ The strip of coastline about a mile in width which separates the town from the shore had been swept by S^udi patrols. /26* regards LOHILii, about 850 refugees had arrived in IDiltuMi' who were mainlj relatires of the inhabitants, who stood security for them. Ho Arab of military age had been admitted. Only 5 British subjects were known still to be in LQH3XJL and arrangements had already been made to advise them to withdraw. 27, all indications seemed to point to the desirability^of proceeding to MIDI forthwith in accordance with the original intentions (paragraph 19), and this was emphasised by fact that the i own appeared likely to fall at any moment, in which event the behaviour of the Sa f udi troops could not be foreseen or relied upon, although news had recently been received from JEDBii. that the Sanxdi Minister for Foreign affairs had given the desired undertaking as to the safeguarding of British lives and property. 28, It had therefore been decided to sail on the following morning (27th). when admiralty message 1757/26 was received, in which the proposed visit to MIDI was made conditional on the concurrence of the British Minister at JEffik, The situation was therefore laid before hm in message timed 0111/27, ....... and the ship meanwhile remained in LnLdLB, 29, xit 2230 on the evening of the 27th the Minister *s reply was received, stating that he concurred in the would prefer that the territorial waters of MisDI should not oe entered before sunset on the 28th in case His Majesty f s G-overament should communicate other views, ' time a repetition of his telegram Mo* 76 to the Foreign Office, LOlfDOIl, was received, in which he reviewed the situation, and recommended the visit, adding that he considered that the 3a*udi Government could have no valid objection to it if he informed them that the object of the sloop was solely to re-assure and. if‘necessary, to assist British subjects in the town. 30, The Ministers concurrence and the other points referred to above were summarised in PlMxdlGE^ message timed 0124/28 and arrangements were made to sail accordingly. The Minister was also informed that the ship would sail, and that territorial waters would be entered as nearly at the time desired as navigational,considerations would admit, (E^MCI , i message 0126/28, repeated to Chief Commissioner, ,JDM). 31, On the morning of the 28th information was received from the administrator that further news had come to hand, I therefore landed and accompanied him by car to the north end of the island, where two further parties of refugees had landed. One party was from MIDI, and included a Yemeni officer and two soldiers, from whom it was learned that the town had been evacuated on the 25th by the orders of the Governor (the *jmil ABDULLaH iiRfiSBl ), and that he and the small garrison had fled to the south, some by dhows and others on foot, 32, This information if correct, materially altered the situation, since if the occupation of the town had been accompanied by any looting and violence to the civil population, it was evident that the shifts arrival would be too late. On the other hand it was impossible to visualise with any certainty the regime which would / prevailf retail tmder the Sa^di occupation, and as it mi(pit well e that the British subjects would still desire strongly to leave, I decided to adhere to the visit, and to approach the Sa’udi Commander with a view io their evacuation should they so desire* This decision was conveyed to admiralty, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, senior Ouicer, Bed Sea Sloops the Minister JSBDia. and the Commissioner -JM in i®2xJCB r S message 1213/28* proceeded at 1210 at 14 laiots, the events recorded in paragraph 31 above having caused a considerable delay in sailing* 33* During the afternoon a repetition of a somewhat mutilated ^message from the Minister at JIDDa to the Foreign Office was received* In this the Minister stated that from a reliable source he had learned of the occupation of MIDI on the 26th* idthou^i this change in the situation was an argument against'a naval visit, he still considered that, on the balance, it remained useful and desirable* 34*- l?3RZ*HCi arrived off MIDI and anchored at 1810 (&amp;one - 3)* Ho salute was fired, owing to the general uncertainty as to the conditions prevailing ashore and to the fact that its return could in no case be expected* 35 . ' The lavigating Officer (Lieutenant B.C* GORDON SMiH, B.iu) and the Interpreter landed immediately at the Customs House in MSRSa BaGLk (Chart l;o*212). and were cordially received by the Sa’udi Customs Gxfiee?, who had lately arrived from JlLaN, his normal post* a Customs Guard of 20 soldiers were also present. A letter (English translation shown in appendix I) had been given to Lieutenant SMITH for transmission to the Saludi Commander, enclosed in which w T as an unsealed letter to a well known British subject in the town, (appendix II], On these being presented, the Customs Officer at once despatched them by car to the .unir iLlBiJb 1M Sxi f UD in MIDI, and, pending his reply, entertained the party in a most friendly and hospitable manner* 36. The man appeared well-informed and intelligent, and volunteered the following information; it is, or course, impossible to guarantee its accuracy. Here the resistance was very feeble, and on the 26th the town was occupied. The .anil and a small detachment of about 3GC troops were pursued in the direction of KABL, where they were overtaken; a brief skirmish took place, resulting in the capture of the iunil, and some 80 or the soldiers, the remainder continuing their flight. The main Sa f udi forces have not entered the / (c) r(c) It appears that something in the nature oi a general amnesty is in force: no restrictions have been placed on the movements of the inhabitants or their property, while those who have removed merchandise from the town are encouraged to bring it back without the imposition of re-entry taxes. This is eprne out bj the fact that when the Customs Officer^on his own initiative, sent a second ear into MIDI with the news that there would be an opportunity for the despatch of letters to the south in/Filled®I ? two British merchants availed themselves of the chance of communicating with ASM and KhMaBiiH* . One of these letters was examined, and^contained a statement that the conditions of affairs in the town was entirely satisfactory, and that any goods might safely be sent there. (d) The strength of the Sa f udi forces was stated to be 15,000. including cavalry,and 200 motor vehicles some of which are armed vdth machine guns. a further 10,000 men were said to be marching from JIZnii 'Co reirforce the column. It seems probable that these figures are considerably exaggerated. (e) The sheikhs of tribes and villages as far south as the vicinity of RODlIDa were alleged to be making their personal submission to the dllR. this confirms reports from other sources that the TIHali tribes are rising in favour of the invaders. (f) The Sa^di troops were said to compare very advantageously with uhe Yemeni levies in equipment, and, particularly in the scale of rationing and pay, which are on a far more generous scale. i^ocal boatmen who took the Bid fish party back to the ship confirmed this opinion. 37. i-xt about 2200 the reply from the aMIB was received (appendix III), and the party re-embarked. It will be seen that Faisal adopted thd attitude that his occupation of MIDI placed the coast on the same diplomatic footing as Sa , ndi territory proper (e.g. JlDDa), and in consequence he protested against the lack ox the advance notification which is customary at that port. In the absence of instructions from his Government he felt himself unable to offer any assistance, and requested the departure of the ship, adding that the lives and property oi British subjects were safe. 38. The evidence referred to in paragraph 36 as to the tranquility of the town and the well-being of the inhabitants, coupled with the iimir's assurances made it clear that no useful purpose would be served by remaining longer in the anchorage, while the matter of the official protest was evidently a question for diplomatic representations. ^ a A „ The situation was therefore reported to all authorities concerned in PKLJGI f S message 'Important” 2356/28. and the ship sailed at 0600 on the following morning (S9th), arriving at OIMRai! at 1600. 39.

The work and achievements of the Mission have formed the subject of a separate Report* In one matter only do they appear to have met with refusal, when a tentative proposal for the establishment of a Landing Ground — though not on the San*A plateau — was put forward* This proposal was strongly discouraged By Qadhi Mahummad Bey (Minister for Foreign Affairs), who explained the Imam’s great aversion to this form of ’’exploitation”, adding that he had previously refused similar requests from the Italian authorities for Air facilities at Medi and Saliff (on the mainland, opposite to Kamaran Island)* * * 3 : # Aden* * * * The Secretary of the Admiralty (Copies to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops)ADEN 22.

B, M.C., A.F.C. ) and their staffs proceeded onboard to welcome the Resident# Shortly after their return to the shore, Colonel Reilly and the Mission landed, and a salute of 13 guns was fired by PENZANCE as his flag was struck. After receiving the congratulations of the Foreign Consuls, members of Public Bodies and leading residents, Colonel Reilly inspected the Guard of Honour mounted by the Royal Air Force, finally proceeding to the Residency where a further Guard was paraded by the Aden Police Force. Lieut-Colonel Wightwick, after handing over the administration, sailed for India on the 19th* * * * ANTI-SLAVERY OPERATIONS . 24. At 1615 of the 21st, the following telegram from the Government Agent, Perim, was passed to PENZANCE by the Chief Commissioner - 'Please inform H.M.S.PENZANCE report received that ”3 slaves awaiting shipment at Jebel Siyan by 'dhow Path el Khair, nacoda Abdul Razack, or dhow 'owned by Sheifeh Admed Anbari of Sheikh Seyd* 'Embarking probably to-night* (Time of origin not 'stated)•' Jebel Siyan (or Ras Siyan) is situated on the French Somaliland coast, 12 miles S. S.W* from Perim and 100 miles from Aden. 25* Although it was clear that the ship could not arrive in the vicinity of Perim until early on the following morning, it was decided to proceed to sea with all despatch (4/5th power), and the ship sailed at 2015, working up to 14.5 knots. This decision was based on the following facts - (a) No such positive information of slaving activities has been received in PENZANCE — nor, as far as is known, in any other sloop — for some years. (b) The name of the dhow and the persons quoted already figured on a 'suspect' list in the ship* (c) The possibility existed that the dhow might be delayed in sailing until late at night, or might decide to remain at anchor off the African coast until after moons et (0045)• (d) Although fresh and favourable winds for the passage from the African coast are to be expected at this season# the possibility of lighter wind^fand consequently of a slower passage could not be ignored* . The ship was darkened, and at 0300 passed through the small,, 26Small Strait, when the armed motor hoat was lowered in the lee of Perim Island and commenced a north-and-south patrol outside the limits of territorial waters in the approaches to Sheikh Seyd* Meanwhile PENZANCE proceeded to the northward at 3/5th power until north of Dubah — a suspected landing place for slave traders — when a sweep was made to the west and south* Nothing, however, was sighted, and the motor hoat, which also had drawn blank, was picked up at 0650 on the 22nd* 27* The ship then entered Perim at 0730 to enable the Commanding Officer to discuss the situation with the Government Agent, but immediately aftei^nchoring a dhow, known to be similar to the Path el Khair, was sighted to seaward, making to the east* The ship at once proceeded to sea, and the boarding boat exaciied her, but much to the disappointment of all concerned, her papers and a thorough search proved her innocence* 28* On return to harbour, Mr.pavey stated that his informant was a trustworthy native of Suqlya (a village in the Protectorate) who, although he had conveyed reliable information on other subjects on previous occasions, had not before given any slave trade intelligence* It further transpired that the suspected dhow had been in Perim during the previous day (21st), and that, although given clearance on that morning, she had in fact remained in harbour until 0600 on the 22nd, when she had sailed, presumably for Pas Siyan* Although it was evidently possible that the presence of PENZANCE had become known to the nacoda, the chances to. the contrary were felt to be sufficient to render desirable another night patrol* 29* After passing the day in harbour, the armed motor boat was accordingly directed to watch an area in the centre of the Small Strait (width about one mile) from 2200, while PENZANCE at the same time proceeded to patrol on a line east-west across the Large Strait* The S. S.E* wind, which had been light throughout the day, died away to lighj/airs during the night, and by 0100 on the following morning (23rd), it became clear that, even should the wind subsequently freshen, the dhow could not make the passage under cover of darkness, and might therefore be countea/to remain in harbour* The patrols were therefore abandoned, and the ship anchored off Perim until daylight* During the early morning a light northerly breeze sprang up, which, coupled with the fact t'hat the ship's presence in the vicinity was by now thoroughly advertised, destroyed any further prospects of success^ PENZANCE therefore proceeded at 0600 to Aden, arriving at 1600* 30* It is a curious coincidence that the information leading to these operations should have been received within a few hours of the despatch of PENZANCE’s submission referred to in paragraph 16, in which, in connection with the negotiations with the Imam, it was stated that no recent evidence as to the continuation of the Slave Trade to Yemeni ports had come to the knowledge of Red Sea Sloops* In view of the Imam’s promised support in the suppression of this traffic, it now becomes increasingly important to produce proofs positive that the Trade still exists, if only on a much reduced scale, in order that pressure may be applied to him through diplomatic channels to make good his undertakings* * * * * DJIBOUTI . 35* Both His Excellency and Mons.Onno displayed considerable interest in the recent San’A treaty and appeared to be under the delusion that Great Britain had ’'taken” the Sheikh Seyd promontory and The Tihama; the misapprehension was removed.**removed. 36. The Slave Trade situation was discussed informally with M.Chapon-Baissac* who* as usual, maintained that no such traffic existed in French territory, and was openly sceptical of the reliability of the information which led to the operations reported in earlier paragraphs. He requested, however, that should similar intelligence be received at any time in the future it should be communicated to him in order that his land patrols may investigate and co-operate. This point will be discussed with the Chief Commissioner, Aden* 37. These coastal patrols along the 210 kilometres (130 miles) of coastline from Djibouti to the Franco-Italian frontier were stated by Mens.Chapon-Baissac to be stationed at 10 kilometre intervals, each consisting of 4 police under a native N.C.O. Mr.T. C.M.Salmon (The British Acting Vice-Consul) estimates the interval at 25 kilometres. The Officer in charge is understood to be quartered at Djibouti, but when the lack of r oad communication along the coast is taken into account, it is evident that his supervision can at the best be but perfunctory; the value of these scattered posts for the prevention of slave-running would thus appear to be slight, a 38. Besides Mr.Salmon, the only other British resident is Mr.Maine, of the Arabian Trading Company. Business is bad, and both gentlemen hope shortly to leave Djibouti; the latter may, perhaps, be replaced by a Greek clerk. 39. Mr.Lowe, the previous Acting Vice-Consul has been obliged to abandon his projected Air Line (See PEMAHCE* s .Report of Proceedings Ho.A*840/4 of 31st May 1933), owing to insufficient capital to meet the requirements of His Majesty’s Post Office conditional to the award of a Mail contract. 40* A considerable increase in the exportation of salt to the Far East has recently been noticeable; Japanese steamers call frequently and during the month a British ship loaded 6000 tons for Vladivostok* I have the honour to be.

On arrival at ADEN on 19th January, news was received that probable date of embarkation of the Sana Mission would De 27th_January, which necessitated the proposed cruise to SOCOTRA aha KI3HN being cancelled., later the date was further postponed to 3rd February and it was possible to carrv out a modified cruise as far as MUX ALL A. ... . ^ From information received, it is. believed that the treaty negotiations with the IMAH have been entirely successful and Colonel Reilly is only waiting for evacuation of Protect 9 rate Territory by the IMAN’S. followers before signing the treaty. The evacuation is going forward though more slowly than was expected. An amusing report was received at the Residency from the Political Clerk (Arab) at HODEIpA, announcing that on successful completion of the negotiations the IMA.N. ordered his band to play fT all day n ^outside Cplonel Reilly T s house 'much to the inconvenience of the Russian and Italian Consul who lived next door. t? He did not express Colonel Reilly ! s views, but these may be left to the imagination. 9. Proceeded for MUKALLA early on 26th January, carrying out six monthly full power trial a.m. and arriving the following day in a mild sand storm. His Highness the SULTAN or SHIHR and MUKALLA was. r in residence but indisposed and suffering from a cold. He sent his Wazir, 8 E 1 YID BUBAKAR KUSEIN to present his compliments with a request that calls should be dispensed with and invited the Commanding Officer and two Officers to / Ga# The Sultan is partially of Indian_descent and has / estates in Hyderabad where he spends most of his time. He is a lar^e unhealthy looking individual reputed to take little interest in improving MUKALLA while converting most of the revenue to his own use and is naturally unpopular with his subjects. Further conference of SAUDI-ARABIAN (headed by FUAD) and YEMENI delegates is probable and_should take place, about middle of February. While outbreak of hostilities at any moment is feared by the SAUDI Government, confidence in a peaceful solution is expressed by the IMAN ! S Ministers. 13. Owing* / AOwinp* to susDicious attitude of YEMENIS, SAdpI troops have°advanced to SAIflA in ASIR and have fprtified mountain posts. Military preparations are continuing on both sides.

No dhows were met. At this time of the year, due to weather conditions dhow traffic practically ceases in the Southern end of the Red Sea except for coastal trade inside the reefs. Trade in dates from the Persian Gulf, which is considerable, has only just commenced and cargoes are conveyed in larger dhows than are usually encountered in this locality. ADEN. 5. Arrived at ADEN on 12th December preparatory to embarking the Mission proceeding to SANA via HODEIDA with the object of negotiating a treaty with the IMA^of the YEMEN. 6. The Resident embarked at 0825 on 15th December and was saluted by the shore battery on leaving Prince of Wales Pier and again on arrival on board when his personal flag was broken at the fore. * * * HODEIDA . 7. Bad weather was experienced after passing PERIM and the passengers, without exception, were glad to reach HODEIDA. A national salute was fired on arrival and returned immediately hy the shore battery, whose gun drill wa,s a distinct improvement on the last visit. (November 1932). The ship^was met by a deputation headed by the Governor of ZEDIYA who came The Secretary of the Admiralty. (Copies to Comm^eg- ^^l^^DITERRANE ANk - 2 - on board to welcome the Mission on behalf of the Governor. 8. At 1530 the Resident disembarked accompanied by the Commanding Officer and Aide-de-camp and was accorded a salute of 13 guns, following which his flag was struck. ❖ * * 9. The Resident was received by the principal officials and a large guard and band (the latter in uniform); also by the majority of the populace who had assembled in their best attire at every available point of vantage. He was conducted to a house near the landing place which had been specially prepared for his accommodation and the party was introduced to the Governor of HODEIDA, SAIF-al-ISLAM ABDULLAH, a younger son of the IMi M. ABDULLAH is aged about nineteen, of slight build and unprepossessing in appearance which is accentuated by a receding chin and an attempt to grow a beard; his eyesight is presumably weak as he wears glasses. After welcoming the Resident on behalf of the Imefl and ordering refreshments he had little to say although Colonel Reilly speaks Arabic fluently. 10. The Mission consists of Lieutenant Colonel B.R.Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E., Chief Commissioner, Resident and Commander-in- Chief of ADEN, and appointed His Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary to the IMAN of the YEMEN. Mr.R.S.Champion, Political Secretary, ADEN.

Mr.Champion, Political Secretary, in whose hands all the preparatory work had been ably accomplished was unable to travel at the last moment owing to illness. He is an experienced Arabic Scholar and his absence would have been greatly felt by the Mission. He was, however, able to join the Mission later, flying to KAMARAN, thence by dhow to the Mainland and motor car to SANA. 12. A portable R.A.F.W/T set was carried by the Mission and communication established with ADEN shortly after arrival at SANA. It had also been hoped to obtain permission from the IMAN for aeroplanes to land at SANA and thus maintain more direct touch, but this was refused. 13. The Resident arranged to leave for SANA at 0700 on the following morning, stopping for one night on the wa^ r . The road has recently been improved and the journey can actually be done in a day. The negotiatirs were expected to take until towards the end of January it was not thought that much would be accomplished until after expiration of Ramadan 16th January. Proceeded at noon on 17th December, informa tion having been received that the Mission had started their journey according to plan - a creditable feat in an Arab country on the part of the Transport Officer. Before sailing generous gifts of bullocks, sheep, chickens, pigeons, eggs, fruit, coffee and vegetables were received - a present from the IMAHlC Government and a suitable letter of thanks sent. ,POLITICAL. - 4 - 10 . it is understood that the situation between IBN SA'UD and the IMAN is improving and reported that they are again exchanging telegrams. From all accounts fighting has been entirely restricted to NAJRAN and a rumour that SA'UDIAN troops had infracted the Southern border of ASIR has been denied.

PEKZANOE at AKABA, 4th December, 1933• 8, The approach to Jedda was made without difficulty and the ship anchored in the Inner Anchorage at 1100 on 18th Uovember. The flag of the country was saluted with 21 guns, which was returned promptly by the shore Battery. 9. Colonel Hamdi Bey called and presented the compliments of the country. This officer fought in the Great War as a Lieutenant in the Turkish Army, and is now the Director of Military Training for the whole Kingdom of Sa'udi- Arabia. Though pleasant personally, it is difficult to imagine that he fills this important post with much zeal or ability. His predecessor, a more efficient German-trained officer, was dismissed for corruption. 10. In the afternoon the Commanding Officer, accompanied by Mr. B.W. Seager (British pro-Consul) called on Sheikh ’Ali Taha and Sheikh ’'Ali A1 Amari, respectively the Acting and Assistant Governors of Jedda in the absence of Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Mu 1 Amman, who was engaged at Mecca in a matrimonial venture. ’'Ali Taha is a Hedjazi who has spent 25 years in Civil Service, firstly under the Turks, then under the Hashimite dynasty, and finally under the present Yfahabbi regime. His colleague is a Hedji. The call of Colonel Hamdi Bey was then returned at the ex-Turkish barracks at the outskirts of the town. The building appeared to be scarcely occupied; 2 armoured cars were observed in the central courtyard, but were evidently in a state of complete neglect. 11. The two Governors returned the Commanding Officers call on Monday, 20th Hovember, and were accorded a salute of 13 guns on their departure. Accompanied by the Mayor of Jedda (Sheikh Ali Salami) and Mr. Seager they lunched with the Commanding Officer on 2End November. 12. Mr. K.S. Twitchell, the American Mining engineer, was in Jedda, having recently returned from El Hasa, where he had been assisting the Standard Oil Company of California in their pros pecting operations, which terminated in the grant of an oil concession by the Sau’dfan Government. Mr. Twitchell made the journey across Arabia by ear and lorry in seven days, and since Mr. Philby has now embraced Islam, it is probable that he is the only living Christian who has performed this feat. 13. As recently foreshadowed elsewhere, the affairs of Mr. H. St. J.B. Philby and his Sharqieh Company are by no means flourishing, and it seems that the terms of his concession for the importation of J*ord cars and all motor tyres are proving financially unsound. Mr. Philby himself was on a business journey to Egypt. The Secretary of the Admiralty, /14,... (Copies to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and Senior Officer, Hed Sea Sloops)Hi (m 14. It is understood that the large Soviet Legation, which holds itself much aloof from the European community, does little 'business, and pays no attention to the pilgrims from Russian territory. This may perhaps be due to the official anti-God policy of the Soviet, and in this connection it is believed that this attitude proves a definite commercial handicap when dealing with the Wahabbi Kingdom, founded as it is so largely on a fanatically religious basis. The same disability operates also in the Yemen. Sport. ^ 16. Two football matches took place, the first against a team composed mainly of Javanese and the second against an Arab side; the former was drawn, and the latter won by the ship, £-0. Both games drew well behaved and enthusiastic crowds of between £000 and 3000 spectators. Football made its first appearance in the Hedjaz about 2 years ago, and initially was banned, as it was thought that football clubs would become a cloak for political intrigue. The Government, however, was not long able to maintain this attitude in the face of the wave of popularity which the game attracted, particularly as it was strongly backed by the Amir Faisal, the Viceroy of the Hedjaz and second son of the King, who alone among the Royal House has visited Europe and acquired a smattering of western ideas. Rather is the game now encouraged in the belief that, instead of criticisms of the Government, the relative merits of prominent players now provide the main topic of gossip in the bazaars. Y/hatever may be the truth of this comforting theory, there can be no doubt as to the grip of the game on the popular imagination; teams are springing up at Mecca as well as at Jedda, professionalism is beginning to show itself, and the days of the Sa^di Cup Final, transfer fees, gate money and other blessings of civilisation may not be far distant. x xxx 17 Throughout the stay, the hospitality offered on all sides was most marked, and particularly at the Legation under Mr. A.S. Calvert, the Charge d*Affaires, whose kindness in providing car conveyance and in assisting in water transpcr t was of great assistance. Political Situation . 18. Ho marked change in the situation on the Yemen frontier has taken place. The Imam has recently re-opened correspondence, by W/T, asking King Ibn Sa^d for the reason for his troop concentrations. The latter replied at length, re-stating his contentions and demands, requesting a reasoned reply to them, and suggesting a further meeting of delegates. To this latter proposal the Imam readily agreed, but, typically, omitted all reference to Sau’dian claims. Once more Ibn Salid pressed for a considered reply, and it was this strongly-worded communication which was incorrectly reported in a Cairo newspaper as constituting an ultimatum. 19. The concentration of troops and tribesmen continues, and is believed to be nearing completion. It is reported in Jedda that the full quotas have not been forthcoming from many tribes, and that in the case of a powerful group in the Horth-west, Ibn Sa*ud has not felt himself strong enough /toto insist on the despatch of any forces. Bedouin who have never seen a white man have recently passed through Jedda en route for the South. xxx I have the honour to he. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) R.H. Sevan.

I accompanied the Chief Commissioner, Aden, ashore for an hour or two, which visit is more fully described in enclosure No.l. 3. Sailed the same evening and arrived at Socotra the next day, anchoring off the capital, Hadibo, at 0830. The Sultan of Quishn and Socotra called on the Chief Commissioner on 4th March, and was saluted with 11 guns on landing. The Chief Commissioner was saluted with 13 guns on leaving the ship to return the call. 4. Some trouble had been caused at Q0ISHN (on the main land of Arabia) which is part of the Sultan’s dominion, by the local authorities obstructing an R.A.F.Officer who was endeavouring to construct a landing ground there, part of the chain required along the south Arabian coast by the R.A.F. as far east as RAS MERBAT. Xn consequence of this unsatisfactory attitude, the Chief Commissioner had ordered a cessation of all local trade with Quishn and Socotra. In actual fact his orders were not likely to prove as far reaching as the Sultan feared, but fortunately the Wazir at Mukalla had sent back a couple of dhows, and refused them leave to trade. As the of Quishn and Socotra had dhows as far away as Muscat, Basra, Bombay and Zanzibar, they jumped to the conclusion that the embargo would be aa effective in those far distant ports as it had proved at Mukalla. They rely on these dhows for imports of food, etc., and as the S.W. monsoon is approaching, when dhow traffic ceases, they had visions of being starved. 5. The Sultan, therefore, was urgent in his appeals for tae embargo to be raised. He has just recently succeeded his cousin, who died last year, and his control is not very effeet- , ive. In addition, he is a spineless individual eternally wrapped in inspissated gloom. As a result of many hours’ talk - I he declared it was no use his writing to his officials at Quishn and that he must come himself. I therefore gave him and eight tatterdemalions passage to QUISHN, sailing from Socotra at 0718 on 5th March. 'Penzance” arrived at QUISHN at 0700 on 6th March, and landed the Sultan and his party for further eonwerarations with his - people. The final result was a withdrawal of all opposition to work on the landing ground, and the local notables came off to call on the Chief Commissioner. In the afternoon Colonel Reilly landed, and I accompanied him to the Government Bar where, in an upper room which the sea breeze kept delightfully cool, the Sultan was informed that the ^ embargo on the trade of Quishn and Socotra would be withdrawn. ^ AB£J&amp; EUR!

The Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops.)?• The democratic nature of the Arab, as well as his respect for his leaders, was well exemplified on this occasion The room was packed with men, boys and slaves, all squatting round, and outside the door was a crow# for whom there was no room inside* Nearly all the men carried rifles, many much bound about with silver wire* Absolute order and quietness prevailed and no one spoke out of his turn, and the arguments and speeches of the leaders, as well as the Chief 00^0^.38^^^s remarks, were carefully listened to. There was an air of dignity about the whole proceedings as well as the participants, despite the, to Occidental eyes, tawdry nature oi the surroundings; the walls of the room being much hung with cracked and fly-blown mirrows, cheap and ugly plates of Kuropean pattern* as well as one or two remarkably ugly paintings on glass of a gryphon-like animal, presumably meant to be a horse* The many colours of the turbans and clothes helped one to forget the fact that in many cases the shirts could not have been washed for a very long time. Not even the Chief Commissioner’s assurance that the embargo would be immediately lifted lightened the Sultan’s gloom. To his anxious inquiry as to when Aden and other ports would know, Colonel Reilly replied - “Aden in two hours, and I can talk to the whole world by the man-of-war and they will know tomorrow'. Then at last relief was faintly portrayed. MU KALLA . BIEJiLI. BAh HAF . 8. 'Pensance' sailed from QUISHN at 1600 on 6th March and arrived at MUKALLA at 1000 on 7th. The Wazir 3EYYID BUBAKR BIN HUBEIN BIN HAMID AL MIHDHAR, with various other notables, called on the Chief Commissioner and was saluted with 11 guns on leaving. Later in the day the Chief Commissioner returned his call and was saluted by 'Penzance' with 13 guns on landing. After tea the Chief Commissioner, myself and several officers, were taken for a drive to the Sultan’s summer palabe, and to see the local waterworks, which appeared to provide excellent breeding grounds for mosquitoes. That night, I and two officers accompanied Colonel Reilly to a dinner given by the Wazir. During dinner the Sultan’s brass band played an excruciating selection of 'music', of which the only tune faintly recognisable was 'A bicycle made for two', although we were informed that all the latest (1) European tunes were being played in our honour. 9. On 8th March I accompanied Colonel Reilly by air tp the WADI HADRAMAUT. This is fully reported in enclosure No.2. We returned to Makulla on 10th March. On my return the First Ifeutenant reported that it had been discovered that small pox was prevalent in Mukalla. The local native doctor had concealed this fact, and it was only discovered by chance. Fortunately the Surgeon Lieutenant found out that the local doctor still had in his possession the whole of a stock of vaccine which the Royal Air Force had specially brought by air only a short time previously. The scoundrel had not made the slightest attempt to use it, and thus save many unfortunates. The entire ship’s company, officers and men, were immediately vaccinated, and no sickness was experienced. 10. Sailed for BIR ALI at 2130 on l©th March, arriving at 0715 on the 11th. Colonel Reilly landed and was saluted by the local fort, re-embarking again after a short interview with the Sultan. Ship sailed for BAL RAF at 0920. 11. Having arrived there, no one came off, and as it was not a very important place the Chief Commissioner decided not to wait, so sailed for ADEN at noon. 12. Arrived at ALIN on 12th March and discharged the Chief Commissioner and his party to the shore.••••••»•....»«.« * * *mmM Mm &amp; 18.

Snd March, 1933. Called for a few hours at the island of ABD EL KURI (50 miles west of Socotra), where there are about 200 inhabitants all told, who Hire a life of the direst penury and discomfort in small houses built up of loose stones and rarely more than 6 feet high. They have no money, but have seen a dollar (Maria Theresa) and know what it means, but are not familiar with other money. They sell fish and shells to samboaks, which come from the mainland (Arabia and Italian Somaliland) with food, and this is their only means of supply as the island produces nothing. 2. For some four months or so during the S.W. monsoon all communication is cut off. The only boats they have are dug-outs for fishing; no samboaks or dhows. 3. H.M.S. 'Penzance* anchored on the south side of the island in BANDER LEVEN, but shoal water encumbers the head of the bay. The well marked on chart is brackish, as is also the well in a settlement some 600 yards up the wadi which runs inland northerly from the head of the bay. This settlement consists of about a dozen huts. The best water is obtainable on the north shore (but even this is brackish)* where there are a few more huts. Two sheep, a few fowls and goats were seen. 4. There is an Aqil (headman) who represents the authority of the Sultan of Socotra, but he lives at the west end of the island. 5. The statement in the Sailing Directions that this island is rarely visited is incorrect, as the natives said that many samboaks came during the fine weather season. Incidentally there were two at anchor in the bay when ’’Penzance' arrived, and a third had left the island as ship approached. 6* It would be difficult to imagine an existence of greater hardship and penury, yet one native who had left the island in his youth and gone to the Arabian coast was apparently quite content to be back! 7. Prom Abd el Kuri^’Penzance?*proceeded to SOCOTRA and anchored off the capital, HADIBO, at 0830 on 3rd March, 1933. The alternative name, TAMP.IDA, given on the chart is a survival of the time when the Portuguese were an important factor, and is never used now. In fact, only the intelligent I natives know what is meant when TAMRIDA is referred to. 8. HADIBO is a very clean little town, set in datepalm groves, and gardens which produce melons, pumpkins, etc. It is backed by a towering range of hills. To the eastward are more date palms in surroundings which, to eyes jaded by the general aridity of Arabia, are both rare and refreshing. Streams with running water meander through the groves, the banks in many places edged with grassy strips. Through all J was blowing the cool N.E. monsoon. The sun, although powerful, was not unduly so, being tempered by the breezes.9. The natives are most obliging, helpful and thoroughly friendly, without that blatant curiosity which so often proves such a burden to visiting Europeans in many other parts of the world. It is high time that the legend that Socotra is populated by a davage and truculent race was finally dispelled, at any rate as regards the neighbourhood of Hadibo. 10. Incidentally, it was only the fact that there was no harbour in the island which decided England to take Aden. In 1835 Haines, who was afterwards the first Resident at Aden, was sent to inspect the island; hence the chart (dated 1835). Had there been any harbour, it was proposed to make a coaling station in Socotra, and Aden was only occupied when the island proved unsuitable, although Aden is robably better placed strategically for control of the trade route, which of course in those days was practically non-existent, since the overland via Suez - Alexandra was merely used for passengers and despatches. Climatically Socotra is far superior to Aden, and it is interesting to speculate on what the British position would be today had we occupied Socotra and some other Power ta en Aden, when the Suez Canal mam opened. 11. The eastern end of the island is split into a northern and a southern ha if by a range of hills running roughly east and west. The result is that the natives have also become divided into two sections# The northern speak Arabic and the Socotrine dialect, but state that the dialect spoken by the inhabitants of the southern half is so different to their own as to be largely incomprehensible. 12. From Hadibo a track runs up a wadi whose entrance is some 5 or 6 miles to the eastward of the town. This track crosses the divide at a height of nearly 4,000 feet, and leads to the southern half of the island. There is another and easier way round (but much longer) by the wadi shewn on the chart, with stream, palm trees and grassy slopes. 13. One of the most remarkable features of the island is the camels.v They climb literally like goats, and when a party was ascending the wadi to the divide, camels were encountered at places on the track where men were not finding the going any too easy. 14. The new Sultan, who succeeded last year on the death of his cousin, is named f ALI BIN SALIM BIN AHMED BIN £0W f ARI BIN , and is rather a spineless individual. He was away in the irterior when ship arrived, but came in that evening. He is also Sultan of Quishn on the Arabian coast, but his authority there is not very great. 15. One of the reasons for the Chief Commissioner, Aden, visiting Socotra was on account of difficulties which the local authorities were putting in the way of a landing ground being made at Quishn for the Royal Air Force, and this finally necessitated the Sultan being embarked and taken across to Quishn, together with his advisers and servants. 16. The day the ship arrived at Hadibo and after the Chief Commissioner had interviewed the local authorities, a party was formed and we all walked some distance inland and camped at the entrance of a wadi leading to the divide. A suitable camping ground was found at the entrance to the wadi, above a stream which flows down the rocky bed, and this em&amp;bled us to enjoy a most refreshing bathe before turning in for a cool and comfortable night, untroubled by mosquitoes or insects. 17 e •\n nc was -— wh , o ^ €xt corning the ascent/begun, following the track two aides o^t^^iaiarrt ® ai ' 1 i n e of comamnicatlon between the Tower, lfclian ^* scene was one of great beauty. covered wita v«r h s ^ line . the elopes being y tlnJ««eLT ith VaIioU8 klnds scrub and smll trees. the wadi t bed r »i^ n ? 1 8B 1 ,1;l fl °* ere » and at the side and below, bea wi th ilowing water interspersed with deen dooIs !Tn7TLr°T eCSi *r, bled in the booking b«ck° I’ Zl* itZl/Z+Z unroUed » wit h the plain intersected by pal* lined streams, and a gliopse of the sea between the hiiia and ? , nr''' T*Z Cliiabin « n °t too difficult.

'CHICAGO DPR WUST' by Hans Helfritz (1032); reported be most inaccurate, as it was compiled by a man who knew little or no Arabic and kept no notes. Only useful for its magnificent photographs# Lieutenant-Colonel The Hon. M. BOSCAWEH, , who has made two trips (1929; 1932) in the Hadramaut and was met there on his third trip. Squadron Leader R.A.M. Rickards, E.A.P., who has flown over more of the territory than anyone else, and has also walked over a very considerable area including travelling from Shibam to Nosaib, which has only once before been done, by Colonel Boscawen in 1932. Personal observation for accompanying photographs and narrative of the visit. MOTE s~ Where pages are indicated, e.g. (page 236), the Hand book of Arabia, Vol.I, is always referred to. As constant reference will be made to the SEYYIDS during this narrative, a word of explanation is inserted here. 2. (Page 221). The SEYYIBS claim descent from the Prophet and hence have an odour of sanctity denied to the ordinary mortal. The original ancestor of the HADRAMAUT SEYYIDS came from Basra many centuries ago, and his tomb can be seen not very far east of Seyim on the south side of the Wadi Hadramaut. Every Beyyid comes to pray here once a year, and on his return fro® a journey will visit this tomb before he goes to his home. 3. Many of the Hadramaut Seyyids have gone abroad to Java and the Federated Malay States and amassed riches and then returned to their native country. Where the Sultan or local ruler is weak, they have virtually assumed control, but only in indirect fashion. They never assume a gubernatorial position, but carry the weight due to their wealth and benefactions. They have, until recently at any rate, occupied a privileged position, and in some ways have almost become a caste. Thiaiis contrary to Mahomet’s precepts, and a sfcjiool of thought is now arising which questions the* 5 right to the prefix and the respect due to the name of SEYYID; (which claim is totally unsupported by the Koran, and is only hallowed by age long custom). 44. The modern claims he can call himself SAYYIB if he wishes to. This is anathema to the crusted Tory, and as a result in Jaya matters have reached such a stage that riots have occurred and the Dutdh Government heen obliged to interfere. To some extent the repercussions will no doubt he felt in the Kadramaut, hut at present the Seyyid is enthroned in ancient dignity, and receives the homage of his less fortunate brethren, 5, Reference I,D, 1128, page 217 - the final paragraph coincides more nearly with local parlance than the previous one as to the definition of ,, KAI)RAMA.UT t# . Careful enquiries, both at Mukalla and inland, revealed a concensus of opinion that the true ^adramaut* was the Wadi and its watershed, while admitting that people at a distance, without knowledge, would embrace the larger region when speaking of the Hadramaut, They always maintained, however, that the latter was incorrect, 6, One at the peculiarities of the Hadraaaut is the manner in which so many of the men seek their fortunes over seas, while leaving their women behind. It is estimated that there are some 30,000 Hadramis in Java and Sumatra (chiefly the former), A smaller number go to Singapore and the Feder ated Malay States, 7, Many of the Seyyids, particularly the EL KAF family of Terim, own much land and house property at Singapore and are very wealthy, although even these people are feeling the effect of world conditions and are reported to have 500 houses unlet. 8, Colonel Boacawen stated that the EL KAF family alone pay £80,000 per annum in taxes in Singapore, This family at present consists of three brothers, whose father went to Singapore many years ago and became extremely wealthy. He made a trust of his fortune and his sons cm only enjoy the income, and hence remain rich men, as they cannot touch the capital. These men also own the Europe Hotel and the Arcade at Singapore, and having returned to their native land insist on having the comforts of civilisation, no matter at what cost. Hence the astounding features of electric light, ice making plant, motor cars, etc,, etc., in a land where every thing which is not produced locally is brought some 130 miles on the backs of camels or men, 9, There is a molter road from Terim towards Shehr, and one from Shehr extending inland* There is, however, a gap of a few miles where the pass of the coastal range has to be crossed, but this gap is not likely to be closed for some time. The completion of the road over the pass is not unattended with difficulties other than the purely physical ones, 10, The EL K&amp;F8 and other Seyyids who have travelled the world naturally fed. shut in at Terim, and desire access to the outer world where their business interest© are, quite apart from the ensuing comfort of travel and the opening up of the country. 11. The Wazir at Mukalla, who is no fool, SEYYID BUBAKR BUTHUSIIH BIH HAMID AL MIHDHAR, professes himself favourable to the road, and in fact all authorities want roads not merely the Terim-Shehr one but others from Mukalla to WABI DOAN and WADI..,..m WADI AMD# The great stumbling block which the Wazir fears, is that once a road is built it will be available for transport of goods as well as passengers* At present, the Seyyids have promised the tribes through whose territory the road runs, that if the Terim-Shehr road is completed it will only be used for passengers and not goods, but they admit this - will not be adhered to# Thousands of samel men will be thrown _ out of employment, as will also all the subsidiary trades dependent on the caravans, i#e. coffee shops, foodstuff merchants, etc#, etc#, at Mukalla, besides the money these men spend in the bazaar there. The probability then is that the camel men will start rebellions and shootings# It is realised that after some years the opening up of the country will probably remedy matters, and the camel men may combine in small numbers and buy a lorry, and thus the camel will merely be displaced by wars and the transport trade remain ~ in the same hands# But without a strong government (at present non-existent) there will undoubtedly be grave upheavals when the camel men (all Bedu) find their trade cut from under their feet, their livelihood gone, and themselves faced with starvation, a state ~ of affairs which is rarely far distant in Arabia# 12* It is not known how many cars there are inland, but Squadio n Leader Rickards once saw a “motor rally* at Terim and counted 75# Only 3 were British, the majority being American# ~ 13. OMAR EL kAF, in whose house the party stayed at Terim, has among his many cars an 8 cylinder Buick, and it is difficult^ to realise that this car was taken to pje ces, engine, wheels, etc#, packed on camels, the chmsis and body carried by men over ^ 130 miles of desert including at least a 4,000 foot climb over the coastal range, and finally reassembled by natives at Terim# _ When these Seyyids have to travel, they are carried in chairs when the limits of motor transport is reached! they never walk or ride a camel# 14* Page 223# But apart from these local curiosities, the outstanding feature of the Hadramaut is the astounding 7 or 8 storied houses and palaces which abound, all built of mud*~ The majority are, of course, left in the raw, but those belonging t&gt; the rich men and Sultans are whitewashed, and in many cases are picked out in blues, greens, pale browns, etc., and give quite a pleasing appearanoe as a contrast to the drab surroundings# 18# The Hadramaut has always been more of a closed book than a good many other parts of Arabia. Prior to 1930, it is believed that less than half a dozen Europeans had ever penetrated here, and of these no man (or woman including , Mrs.Bent) had systematically explored the country# Some had done one part and some another, but the hostility generally 4 shown to Europeans was a fairly effective frar, and Hirsch in 1893 (page 235; was only aide to spend a few hotkrs in Terim. In 1931 Van der Meulen and Van Wissman visited the country and did a most extensive trip, full details of which are given in their book# In 1929 Lieutenant-Colonel The Hon.M# Boscawen did his first trip, but he does not keep notes, or make maps, but just wanders about the country as he pleases# He is now (March 1933) on the point of setting out on his third trip, intending to work north ward with the 3 r A tribe (who are great raiders) and having ikirted, or crossed, the S#W. portion of the Rubh A1 Khali, come out at Jedda in the west or Dhofar in the sast, depending on how circumstances eventuate# 1616. Some years ago the R.A*F# from Aden began flying over the country s operating from Fuwa aerodrome 6 miles west of Mukalla, but it was not until October, 1932, that Squadron Leader K.A.M. Rickards established the first aerodrome at HAUTA at the western end of Wadi Hadramaut. Another was opened at the end of 1932 at SHIBAM, and in late 1932 the Air Officer Commanding, Group Captain 0*T. Boyd, A.F.C* , landed with 3 planes at Shlfeam and visited Seyun and Terim. 17. In March, 1933, the Chief Commissioner, Aden, Lieutenant-Colonel B*R. Reilly, C.I.R*, O.B.E., accompanied by Group Captain Boyd (Air Officer Commanding, Aden), Lieutenant- Colorel M*C# Lake, Political Officer, Captain H.V. Rose, Personal Assistant, Comiaander A.R. Farquhar, H.M.S. ^Penzance’; and other Air Force Officers, In five machines, paid his first official visit. 18. On Wednesday, 8th March, 1933, the party left Fuwa aerodrome at 1518 in 6 planes, proceeding at first to the east ward for a few miles and then turning inland for Terim. The maritime range was crossed at about 6,000 feet, and for the next quarter of an hour the country flown over was rugged in the extreme. (Page 218). Then the DJOL was reached. This is a peculiar formation, being quite flat and is probably an old sea bed. Colonel Boscawen states it is full of fossils. The plateau is intersected with wadis which, once the foothills are cleared, are not very deep, but a peculiarity is the mounds which project from this plain, also flat topped. The planes kept at about 4,000 feet until hearing Tarim, by which time height had fallen to about 3,000 feet and the planes were flying in the wadi, level with the djol, which is about 1,000 feet above the Wadi Hadramaut. (Page 235). From Terim down to Shibam the breadth of the wadi varies (at a guess) from 1 to 3 miles. 19. At Terim (16° N., 49°E) there is a stream above ground, and it runs east for some 40 miles and finally disappears again. Another branch runs a short distance to the southward. From Terim west td Shibam, a distance of about 46 miles, the cultivation is practically continuous, with the exception of one small gap in the vicinity of Mariamn, although it never extends across the wadi but is a strip, mostly on the i south side, the northern side of the wadi not being so fertile, f -I 20. (Page 234). Finally the planes landed at Shibam, the flight from Terim having taken nearly half an hour, and provided a magnificent spectacle. The flat top of the side© is broken by spurs jutting out, marking where side wadis enter J the main one. Below are fertile strips of date palms, fields I and gardensxn and finally, dominating even the large scale of the scenery, are Seyun and Shibam, towns with their remarkable J houses. Between the large towns are many villages, so that J! the eye is resting nearly all the time on the green of k cultivation. The air force photographs in Van der Meulin's book show this very well, particularly the one of page 120* 21. The populace were out in force and were until the moment the last plane landed, when they every-where, while a salute was fired from a fort the cliff forming the south side of the wadi. Seyun at kept back swarmed J on the top of J22, One of the first things which is most noticeable in Arabia is that the average male carries a rifle in much the same way as an Englishman carries a stick, with s*fcelt rull oi cartridges strapped round his waist, and a jamhiyah, or cmve dagger, in the front of his belt* They thus, combined wi * the long locks of hair word by the Beduwin, present an aspect of some ferocity, which is as a rule entirely unfounded, at any rate when they are encountered under circumstances such as these* Possibly if met out in the desert, they might on occasion prove not so docile, but they are as a general not actively hostile to Europeans in districts where the latter are not a ^rara avis’*, and this is no longer the case in the Hadramaut. Rifles are common among the townsfolk as well as the Bedu. S3. Oars were waiting to take the party to the guest house. This belongs to Sheikh Bubakr ? who is a rich merchant in Shibam and has two brothers* All three have been to Singapore. Here Bubakr read an address of welcome to the Resident, who had been received by the Sultan of Shi bam, ALI BIN SAJLAH AL QU’AITI, a somewhat cadaverous and melancholy looking individual who, however, is reported to exercise effective control* 24. Shibam is a Qu’aiti town, the same tribe as the Mukalla people, and the boundary between the Qu’aiti and Kathiri tribes lies not far east of the town. 26. Broadly speaking, Bhibam is the commercial town, Seyun the seat of government (such as it is) and learning, and Terim the seat of learning in the Wadi Earamaut, although Terim ’does not hold the same position as it did formerly* 26* The guest house is whitewashed, picked out with pale blue and green wafches, and is spotlessly clean. At the back is a small swimming pool some 20 feet squax’e, filled from a well by slave labour, the men and women walking down an inclined plane and so lifting the water filled bags which tip into a channel, whence the water is led as desired. These men and women work at this water lifting from dawn to du»k. Occasionally a donkey provides the power, but nowhere were camels seen drawing the water as at ^uishn, or bullocks as India. The overflow from the bath is arranged to irrigate the palm trees when so required. 27. Besides the Sultan and Sheikh Bubakr and his brothere were all the local notables, and a most marked feature, which was first met here and continued everywhere throughout v e visit was the extraordinary friendliness and evident desire to make everything as pleasant as possible. , . . * It may here be remarked that this friendliness extended to a temporary suspension of hostilities between two rival factions 28. The next day when the party was between ahurfa^and yfermn* the driver of his car remarked to Colonel Reilly, you Sot, as a rule, come along here Resident remarked that he saw no escort, to which the driver replied, pointing to the small Union Jack flying on toe bonnet, is our escort' 1 * However, next day the cars on the return journey passed the north side of the wadi, (the outward track had been the ^ south aide), so perhaps courtesy was not expected to last more than 24 hours* Va»Van der Meulen repeatedly refers to this ceaseless warring between factions, and its fatal effect upon the country* 29. Aftefc tea and speeches, cars took the party to the town which is about a mile from the guest house. The chief features are the narrow streets between the high houses, the carved doors of the well—to—do houses, and the Sultan’s palace. Owing to the projecting arrangements of the soil pipes, it is equally necessary to watch your head as your step here. We were also shown houses belonging to the Bubakr family, all beautifully clean inside, although the roomiere small compared to those houses seen at Seyun and Terim. The inhabitants, while naturally curious to see the ’’Vaii of Aden* as they all call the Chief Commissioner, were never unmannerly* By this time it was getting dark, so we returned to the guest house for the night, and were left alone. As there was fortunately no official dinner, a peaceful evening and night was consequently spent. 30. The wadi is about 2,000 feet above sea level and blankets are necessary at night. By day it is, of course, hot, but by no means unduly so at this time of year, and the air very dry. In the height of summer the heat during mid-day and ... afternoon must be intolerable, but even then it must cool off at night. 31. Next day (9th March) Shibam was again visited fdr talcing photographs, and it may be remarked there appeared to be no objection raised in photographing a mosque, a matter one is strictly warned against at Jedda under Wahabi rule. 32* The previous evening we had been joined by the doctor, Omar Hayatt, (Edinburgh degree), who has been brought to Terim by SEYYID ’ABDURRAHMAN BIN SHEIKH Ah KAF, at his expense, as town physician, there being no other medical man in the Hadrament, as the Arabs know nothing of medicine by western standards* Unfortunately, having performed this public spirited act, no f-arther interest has been taken, and although the doctor has been two years at Terim not a single member of the A1 Kaf family has ever visited his dispensary, and he finds it an up-hill fight against Arab superstitions. He is a pleasant person rand speaks quite good English, so is usually detailed to look after visitors. Colonel Boscawen was also in Shibam, waiting for the S’A tribesmen to coae in and fonp his caravan. I The Sultan had sent out for them, but it would be about 4 or 5 days before they could arrive. According to the doctor, Omar Hayatt, in many cases slaves are treated better than servants. 33. The party set out for Seyun (page 836) in ears about 0940 on 9th March. le were to lunch there and change cars, since our present hosts being Qu’aiti it would not do to arrive at Terim in any but Kathiri cars. 34. There is always rivalry between the Qu’aiti’s and the Kathiri* s, and the boundary between the two is only a short distance east of Shibam, the Qu f aiti sphere being to the westward and the Kathiri to the eastward. The Qu’aiti cover roughly Mukalla-Shehr and surrounding country, the Wadis AMD, BO’AN and WADI HADRAMAUT up to Shibam inclusive.The Kathiri east of Shibam, and the country north of —- Shehr on the northern side of the maritime range and extends up the Wadi HaTamaut as far as Bir Barhut, a deep save and place of terror and mystery to the Arabs which was first explored by Van der Meulen and Van Wissxnan in 1931 ¥ unless Colonel Boscawen had preceded them in 1929. 36* The great need of the country is for a strong government* The Arab always has a fissiparous tendency, and nowhere is it better illustrated than here. Between Shibam and Terim, a distance of less than 60 miles, there are several rulers. Shibam and to the westward to Wadis Do’an and Amd, by the Sultan ’Ali bin Salah al Qu f aiti f who is a Qu*aiti and appointed by the Sultan of Mukaila. His rule is effective and the area he governs fairly well run. At Seyun is Sultan ’Ali bin Mansur bin Ghalib al Kathiri, a Kathiri, whose rule is not so effective. At Ghurfa, a few miles to the west of Seyun, there is no real governor but merely a local rich man who has established himself in control to a certain extent. A private war is being, and has been, waged here for years, and the local trenches were seen just outside the town. 36. The Sultan of Terirn, VaBDULLA BIN MUHSIN, (also Kathiri), lives at Seyun and his control is nominal, as Terim is run by the Seyyids, of whom the chief are the EL KAF3. Elsewhere I refer to this Sultan being held up on the road . between Seyun and Terim. There are other villages along the wadi, of which it was stated, in reply to inquiries, that some obey the government and some do not. Some 16 miles east of Terim is EMT, and here again is a different authority, the Seyyids being really in control here. 37. The road (or rather track:) led through palm groves and past fields and villages, and certainly presented many interesting features* Some houses nave the four corners of the windows splashed with whitewash, which gives a look as though someone has been playing noughts and crossesI The women wear high steeple crowned straw hats when work ng in the fields; this, combined with their flowing blue robe and dark features, gives them a very witch-like appearance. . The vast majority are very shy and do not like to be photo graphed. On the other hand^ when driving past a group on the roadside, there will nearly always be one among them whose predilection for the ,f glad eye n will overcome her fears. But the general rule is an immediate averting of the head and a masking of the face a© soon as the presence of Europeans is realised* 38* After about an hour*s drive, we reached GHUHFA* The road was lined by tribesmen and townspeople who presented a most picturesque appearance with their many hued garments, rifles and daggers. A ragged feu-de-joie was fired, each man _ firing at least 3 or 4 rounds. When it is realised that old *46 Lee Enfield ammunition costs 1 dollar (Maria Theresa) per 3 or 4 rounds, and each round of Mauser or Mannlicker ammunition costs a dollar a piece, and that the usual monthly earnings is about 10 dollars, it will be realised that a man who lets off 3 or 4 rounds is doing one hpnour at considerable expense to himself.59* It is impossible to convey in words the picturesqueness of the scene* The dark faces aglow with curiosity and smiles, the variegated colours of their clothes and headdress, the ragged volleys (it is usual to smile hard and hope for the best as the muzzles are by no means all pointing upwards), all against the towering background of wadi cliffs, the town with the chief house®, the mosque and minaret, the Kabr or tomb of the local saint painted a dazzling white, 40* AftOJB a visit to the house of OmtlD BIN ABBAB, the local big-wig, we proceeded for Seyun* It was just after leaving Ghurfa that the incident related above of the Union Jack being adequate escort occurred 41* (Page 23b)» Arrived at the main gate of Seyun abou 1100, and the reception here wa® extremely well organised* bines of whitewash each side of the road marked the limiti beyond which the crowd was not to encroach* From the gate to the rest house, which is a sort of summer villa of the Sultans, is about half a mile, and the roadside was densely crowded, the colours being more variegate* than any seen elsewhere* An outstanding feature was two dazzling white houses whose roofs were crowded with women in deep indigo blue clothes. Behind towered (literally) the palace of the Sultan, the square keep in the middle, with two 13ac]t horizontal bands, flanked by tapering towers, and at the back and higher up the white palace of the Sultan of Terlm, nephew of the Sultan of Seyun* There was no feu-de-joie, the men lining the road present ing arms - in some cases reversed, - but two old muzzle loaders emitted most satisfying bangs with volumes of white smoke at somewhat irregular intervals* 4:2m last of the Sultan 1 a palace is a wide open space, and th&lt;m further away the summer residences of the local notables and rich men, each standing in its garden and date palm grove* Dry wadi beds intersect this area and satisfactory roads, the whole being literally a garden suburb* The rest house is white picked out with the usual blue, green and rust coloured washes, and in front of the two chief reception rooms is a colonnade facing a swimming pool some 40 feet square and 4 to 6 feet deep* The pool is filled by a motor pump from a deep well close to, and by arranging the levels of the supply channels and drains, the overflow leads away to water the palms and garden* The whole floor space was covered in rugs; some very good ones, but a fair number must have come from Axminster* From the bathing pool one looks back at the two palaces of the Sultans, with some pale green Kabrs in the left foreground* As usual the sky line is the wadi cliffs. 43. The Sultan of Seyun, ’ALI BIN MANSUR BIN GHALIB AL KAfHIRI. and the Sultan of Terim, f ABDULLA BIN MUHSIN, (nephew of T Ali), and a large number o^^hotables were assembled* Among them was SEYYID ’ABDURRAHMAN BIN SHEIKH AL KAF, who practically rules Terim, as the Sultan of Terim nearly always lives at Seyun, The Sultan ’ALI is head of the Kathiri tribe and his rule runs from just east of Shibam to Terim and beyond up to Bir Barhut. He is the ostensible ruler of the Wadi Hadramaut east . of Shibam.52 44. A speech of welcome was read hy the 7 year old son of the Sultan of Seyun, •ALI BIN MANSUR, who has only one eye. The child was very intelligent looking and self possessed. The usual tea, etc*, was handed round, and then after about 10 minutes the notables withdrew and we were able to enjoy the swimming pool. After bathing, an excellent Arab luncheon was provided, commencing with two entire sheep well stuffed with rice and et ceteras, being placed on the table. The experts said it was the best Arab meal they had ever experienced, and to the newcomer it certainly was very good. Iced water was provided in large thermos flasks* 46. Later a call was paid on the Sultan of Terim, ABDULLA BIN MUHSIN. His palace is smaller than that of his uncle, Sultan *ALI, but everything warn spotlessly clean. We sat on the floor in a small room with good rugs, but some very distressing European prints hanging on the wall with cheap mirrors rather spoilt the effect* Another and larger room had some fine carved and fretted floors with old gold round the edges* 46* At Seyun an ex King’s African Rifles askari was seen, who had donned hie war medals and was very pleased to be Questioned about them. 47. Left Seyun at 1430 and proceeded for Tertis* On the usual route via the main wadi are some villages whose inhabitants object to cars and Seyyids. We were told that it was better to take the motor road which hL.s been made over two necks which project into the wadi. While it is true that the ^ultan of Terim was recently held up here, the real reason for taking us that way was to show the road, since we returned via the main wadi next day without incident. 48. This road was made some time ago by SEYYID ’ABDURRAHMAN BIN SHEIKH AL KAF to short circuit these obstreperous villagers and enable people to get from Terim to Seyun and Shift am. The constructor is an Arab who had worked under the Italians at Asmara in Eritrea. He has made a good job although his gradients are rather steep. The road is just broad enough for one ear, which must not have too long a wheel base otherwise it will not be able to negotiate the hairpin bends. We were fortunate in being able to persuade our driver to change into low gear when descending, instead of trusting to his brakes. Even then it was by me means a joy ridei Van der Meulen refers most feelingly to his experience when he was unable to persuade the driver to change down. 49. We were delayed three quarters of an hour on the hillf f by a car breaking down and so did not reach Terim until nearly sunset, when we went to the house of SEYYID ’UMAR BIN SHEIKH AL KAF, who has only recently returned from Singapore. 60. The women at Terim wear green or saffron coloured r £}L e8 » wiler « a » blue is the predominating colour elsewhere, and green was never seen anywhere except at Terim. A few saffron wer€ seen on the wa y Seyun and also on the coast at Mukalla. The green colouring is most effective. 51. (Page 236). The AL KAF family are virtually the rulers of Terim, as the Sultan does not carry much weight, and money talks*’ in Arabia as well as New York. The family have certainly done a good deal for the town. *tt?er i actiyiUes? f * nfl fooa to th ® » oor * ^olde* many69 68* The houses of the rich Seyyids are many storied, and some have electric light plant besides ice making machines and refrigerators; all of which, it must not be forgotten, comes up by camel transport* f UMAR AL KAF 1 s house is gaudy, and there is too much of the bad European taste so eomsion in such circumstances* He himself ia a sprightly man of about 33, with a pleasing face, and he was obviously doing his utmost to entertain us* But it was very much the rich Europeanised Arab doing the honours, and the simplicity of the Bub&amp;kar family at Shibam was lack ng. (All the party remarked when we reached the guest house at hhibaw next day that it was like getting home) • There was no pretentiousness or ostentation there compared to Terim* and although it i® -crimps ungrateful to cavil at our host's efforts, there was no doubt as to which we preferred* 33* A very large gathering of Beyyids and notables were assembled, and the usual speech making was gone through* l*ater some of us webe able to escape to the swimming pool, which certainly was a most attractive one with one end framed in palm tree®, and a nearly full moon shining over all* A very pretentious European dinner, badly cooked, occupied a considerable portion of the evening, and we finally turned in in e:room so hung with gilt mirrors that even a professional beauty would have been satisfied* The electric light and fans failed* however, at 10 p*m*, so the usual Arab touch was not lacking; 34* Next morning (Friday, 10th March) there was only time for a hurried Ihbk Itunsa at the old castle, the minaret 136 feet high, reputed to be the highest in Arabia, and then back by the main wadi the whole way to Shobam without incident* 65. Terim is a place of learning, although now of lesser importance than Seyun, and people come from all over Arabia to study theology, the only subject taught* §6* Finally the passage back to Fuwa landing ground was made in Just over an hour from bhibam, as we proceeded direct, the outward Journey having been more roundabout* The character of the country flown over was the same, with the exception that the maritime range is about 1,000 feet higher (some 6,000 feet) than further to the eastward* 6?* 3o ended what was certainly a most interesting experience, and one which hitherto very few people have been privileged to undergo* The whole visit was one long series of outstanding contrasts* f e covered in about one hour what the toiling caravans take at least 10 days to achieve. All told, 9 Englishmen were assembled, and received with every mark of courtesy, respect and attention, in a part of the world where since man first appeared on earth up to 4 ye&amp;re ago, only 6 Europeans had ever penetrated, and they did ao at considerable peril and in grave discomfort. 68* In a few years, if the motor roads are built. Cook’s no doubt will be running toura to the H&amp;dramaut, but we have had the privilege of seeing the first pages being turned of a hitherto practically sealed book, and the Navy has now penetrated (by courtesy of the Boyal Air Force) to parts it ha® never reached before.From the point of* view of government, Quite apart from the sentimental side, the control from Aden of this district which at present is purely nominal, will he much facilitated now personal contact has been established between the Resident and the local rulers# 60# While it is not British policy to interfere with these people, yet questions do crop up in which both sides are interested, and although the keystone of our policy is friend ship with the Qu’aiti with whom we have treaties of long stand- iftgt yet it will not be impossible to assist the Kathiri at the same time without in any way sacrificing the older friends, and possibly in time to come England may be enabled to reconcile these ancient enemies and so assist in bringing peace and order to a distracted area.tmm Admiralty to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, extracts from a report of proceedings of the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, in H.M.S.

On 2nd December at 0900 I closed JBBEL TI1B witrh / the intention of sending some books and papers but the swell did not permit landing. Proceeded to KM&amp;rtM by the North passage and arrived at 1800. 3. There was no information to show any change in the situation in ASIR* All refugees had been ordered to leave the island and were clear by 7th December. Accordingly I proceeded with the programme originally projectei having ascertained that the Chief Commissioner Aden concurred that the presence of the ship at KMhsiM was no longer necessary. PARI SAN ISLANDS were deliverately avoided in order that there should be no impression of British countenance or support of the revolt. I had consulted with the Chief Commissioner when at ADEN with regard to the policy it was desirable to adopt. X X X X X 7 ft was ascertained that 60 refugees from GIZAN FAR I SAN and KAMARAN arrived at MASSAC A on 6 th December. X X X X X 13. MUKALLA was reached on the morning of 18th December, a few dhows being boarded on passage. Calls were exchanged with the Wazir, Seyyid Bubakar Husein, representing the Sultan who was absent in India. We had a friendly reception and were entertained to luncheon in the Sultan f s Palace. Motor cars were placed at our disposal for a duck shooting expedition. 14. Sailed at 1835 on 19th December and arrived on the following morning at BIH ALI. There was a strong easterly wind blowingblowing and landing was difficult. Visits were exchanged with the Hepresentative of the Sultan who was absent in ADEN. The Representative complained that his neighbours from BAL HAF (20 miles west of BIR ALI) had arrested two dhows and imprisoned six of his villagers and asked if I could do anything to procure their release. It was a coincidence that when at ADEN the Chief Commissioner had asked me to visit BAL HAF as well as BIR ALI in order to avoid jealousy as a good deal of friction existed between the two tribes. 15. I reported the complaint to the Chief Commissioner and proceeded to BAL HAF. The Sultan was friendly but somewhat deaf and loquacious. I believe he felt that the ship had been sent specially to BAL HAF on account of the existing circumstances The result of my proceedings are reported in Enclosure Ho. 2 herewith. At both places we were well received. Gifts of honey, fruit and a goat were presented during our visits to MUKALLA, BIR ALI and BAL HAF, and suitable presents sent in return. xx xx I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) C.S.

The Chief Commissioner, ADEN. Sir, I beg to report that I interviewed the Sultan of Bal Haf this morning and informed him of your message 1956 of 20th December, having ascertained previously that the report from BIR ALI was correct. 2. On request I gave him written instructions to release the dhows and their crews. He then stated that the crews had already been released shortly before the arrival of H.M.S. HASTINGS (1600 - 20th December), but that the dhows were still at BAL HAF. After some discussion he promised to send a message to BIR ALI forthwith requesting that men should be sent to take them away. 3. It appears that the dhows were detained as a reprisal for the theft of four canoes from the fishing village of JILLAA. The canoes were not actually stolen by the Bir Ali but by a Bedouin tribe (Ahl-el-Adin from AL-HAMIA). Balhaf stated that this Bedouin tribe were close friends of the Bir Ali and that the latter/ ■ 1 — ■' I ■ 1 M** 206 lattar had incited and paid the former to commit the critic♦ 4* He also state- that he is alwajs ready to obey the instructions ol the British Government but that his tribe are very indignant at the loss of the canoes and he fears there may b© trouble it the canoes are not returned or compensation paid* I have the honour to be.

Ship sailed on 23rd September, and among the dhows boarded that day was one off Yochtulon board which was a slave boy, the property of the Nakhuda* After careful enquiryt # enquiry, I came to the conclusion that I was not justified in removing him* A full report on this matter has been made separately to the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops. Anchored that evening in Perim. Owing to the fine weather, dhow traffic was fairly large and 19 were examined in the course of 8 days. 9. Sailed from Perim e.m. 26th September.

I am commanded dy My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, extracts from a report of proceedings of the Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops, in H*M.S. PENZANCE for the period 12th December, 1931, to 13th January, 1932.Muscat# Information received from Senior Officer Persian Gulf, that the visit to Sur by ’’Triad”, two Plying boats and British India s.s* ’’Chadkar” did not have the desired result viz. subjection of Sur tribes to Sultanate of Muscat and Taxation. Muscat to Aden. Passing Merbat a dhow bound North was closed. She hove to and sent her dugout with an appeal for food. Examination of her papers showed that she was 8 days out from Socotra bound for Aden with fire wood. Italian registration. Papers in order. This begging for provisions by dhows is a common occurrence. Aden . French Sloop ’’Vitry le Francois” was originally intended to act as escort for thetwo submarines to Saigon, but large boiler defects necessiated immediate repairs. A complete set of new boiler tubes were sent out from France in the relief Sloop. Work could not be undertaken in Djibouti, so Cowasjee Dinshaw^ (of Aden) estimate was accepted. When boiler was opened up all tubes were found to be burnt out or badly distorted owing to prolonged shortage of feed water when under steam. His Swedish Majesty’s Ship ”Fylgia” - Captain Count G.G.C.Wachtminster, A.D.C., arrived at 0800 on 21st December. The Officer of the Guard returned with a message expressing a wish that all official calls might be postponed until the following day after ’’Fylgia” had completed with coal. The Resident Aden gave an official luncheon party attended by Captain and 4 Officers from ’’Fylgia”. Official calls were exchanged with ’’Fylgia” the following day. ’’Penzance’s” motor boat was placed at the disposal of the Resident as he has now no boat provided for the purpose. An official ball at the Residency was attended by a large number of Swedish Officers, including the youngest son of the King, a Cadet, and nearly all the European colony of Aden/Aden* The interview with Resident Aden finally resulted in the conveyance of the Medical Mission to Mocha. Aden to Mocha * Prom information received from the Imam’s agent, A Sheik who accompanied the Medical Mission as Liaison Officer, it appears that the telegraph line from Hodeida to Sheih Seyd has been reopened after several years disuse* The question was raised when a new building was noticed in a prominent position on the Arabian side of the Small Strait, Babel Mandeb. The Yemen Government has approached the Eastern Telegraph Company through the Manager of Perim Coal Company, requesting that the cable between Sheih Seyd and Perim might be re-fitted* The Eastern Telegraph Company has referred the matter to Head Quarters in London, but no reply has been received. This information was confirmed at a subsequent visit to Perim. Mocha * The reception of Senior Officer Red Sea Sloops on landing on the beach from the Whaler to call on Sheik, Syed Abdul Jelil Bin Ahmed Pasha, was similar to that previously reported on by ’’Dahlia' • It was ascertained that the only Europeans in ruined Mocha were an Italian Doctor and two Italian Mechanics for the motor car which with several machine guns have recently been presented to the Sheik by the Italians. When the smartness of the Guard and the impressive appearance of about 200 armed Arabs were remarked upon, the Sheik volunteered the information that the Italians had been responsible for their training, and that they were all good shots, with plenty of ammunition for practice. Ammunition, petrol, foodstuffs, motor car spare parts and agricultural implements were being unloaded from several dhows ex Massowa. The vessels lie to mooring posts in about a fathom of water within a few yards of the sandy beach. The shoal water is smooth for about a cable to seaward/i -4- seaward under the lee of the inshore reefs and ruined jetty to the Southward. Aden to Kamaran, A call was made at Perim for two hours. The Manager of Perim Goal Company stated that as there would in future be no coal burning Sloops in the Red Sea he was proposing not to replenish his stock of Welsh Coal - S60 tons remaining after 'Dahlia’s” last coaling. It is understood that the trade in coal and oil at Perim is very poor and reflecting world trade depression. 'The overhead expenses for maintenance of staff, equipment and navigational facilities of Perim Islands and harbour are now out of all proportion to the gross takiagg*. 'Very few ships find it necessary to bunker at Perim, now that the outward bound cargoes are so reduced that coal burning ships can commence their voyages v/ith all fuel required for the round trips.' Kamaran . Moored inside Kamaran Bay. Information from Captain Wickham, Resident, that only about 10J&amp; normal number of Pilgrims have passed through quarantine to date. A well has been bored (by private enterprise) approximately 1-| miles S.S.W. of Kamaran Native Village. By means of a windmill (conspicuous mark from seaward) good water is now available in settlement. When pipe line is completed the Indian Government will be asked to take over the plant. SECTION C. Slave Trade Intelligence. No fresh or original information has been forthcoming during the period covered by this or the former report, in fact the several authorities with whom the matter of slaves has been discussed appear to have nothing to add to their previous remarks and reports, which have been detailed and amplified in the several Letters of Proceedings from the Red Sea Sloops ddrlng the past few years. The Acting Vice Consul at Djibouti and his pre- cl ecessor/-5- decessor Mr,Salmond merely repeated the many items of evidence i in support of the contention that slaves continue to he exported from Abyssinia via Dungkali territory (Tajura and : Obok district) with impunity. They assert (no brief is held for such sweeping statements) that the French Authorities, not only do not exercise effective control over their protectorate, particularly the coastline from Tajura to the Italian Eritrean border, but that their subordinate and Native Officials will not risk interference with these illicit activities, even if they do not deliberately countenance the traffic in which not a few of them have personal interests. Whether it be contemporary historical literature on Arabia and the Arabs, or intelligence reports originating in the countries bordering the Red Sea, all of them make the most very of this/tempting subject of universal interest. Slaves; and all of them agree in so many words that that part of French Somaliland North of the Gulf of Tajura is what may be described as the Clearing house of the slave trade, 1 and the South West monsoon months of June, July and August the 'Slave trooping season'. However, all that may or may not be, one is bound to suspect this part of the coast as the obvious outlet, both geographically and otherwise; and further there is no doubt that, of all available natives, Abyssinians are or have been the most in demand in Arabia, On the other hand it is v/ell known that at the present time there is an acute shortage of ready money in Arabia, and no Slave Dealer is likely to run all the risks of the trade if he is not certain of cash payment on delivery. The Abyssinian boy, age 15, who was a member of the crew of the dhow boarded off Kamaran stated that he knew of several Abyssinians in his district who were born slaves of slave parents, but who were now freed, as he has been, by the goodwill of their original owners acting up to the spirit/ - mmspirit of their religion. Onlv two slaves, one male and one female (Abyssinian) were manumitted in Jedda during September and October, 1931. ^ ^ jf: 5jc I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd) M.JOHNSON.
