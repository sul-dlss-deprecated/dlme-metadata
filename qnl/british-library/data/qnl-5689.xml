CONFIDENTIAL. Correspondence and Memoranda respecting Consular Jurisdiction in Persia. No. 1. Mr. Merivale to Mr Hammond.—{Received March 31.) Sir, India Officey March 27, 1873. I AM directed by the Duke of Argyll to transmit to you, for submission to Earl Granville, and with the request to be favoured, at as early a date as possible, with any remarks his Lordship may wish to make on it, the annexed letter,* with inclosures, recently received from the Government of India relative to Consular jurisdiction in Persia. The documents alluded to in paragraph 18 of the Government letter, have already been communicated to you in my letter noted in the margin.f I am, &amp;c. (Signed) HERMAN MERIVALE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. The Governor-General of India in Council to the Duke of Argyll, My Lord Duke, Fort William, January 24, 1873. WE are at length in a position to reply to your Grace's despatch, dated 31st May, 1871, on the question of Consular jurisdiction in Persia and the Persian Gulf; and we have now the honour to forward, for the information of Her Majesty's Government, a copy of the papers marginally noted, relating to the subject.J 2. In the discussion of this question, care must be taken to distinguish between the legal position of the British Government in relation to Foreign Powers, and its position in respect to its own subjects: points which though quite distinct, are nevertheless easily confounded. 3. It would seem scarcely necessary for us to observe that the Foreign Jurisdiction Act cannot confer any jurisdiction as against the Government of a foreign country. It is intended solely to bind those over whom the Foreign Government allows British juris diction to be exercised. The Act assumes that the jurisdiction has been granted, and is addressed to remove doubts as to how far such jurisdiction is controlled by English Law. This is done by sections 1 and 2. By the four next sections the Act confers some useful powers for taking evidence and carrying accused persons and convicts from one place to another ; but these are exceptional and comparatively unimportant operations, affecting persons and things external to, as well as those within, the jurisdiction conferred by the Foreign Government. 4. Probably two first sections of the Act are only declaratory of the law as it was, and as it would have been decided had it come before a British court of justice. But however that may be, it is clear that the Act takes effect whenever the Crown acquires * Foreign letter, dated 24th January (No. 19) 1873. t Letter to Foreign Office, dated March 5, 1873. ^ To Bombay Government, August 25, 1871; Bombay Government, Octobtr 28, 1872; to Colonel Pel'y, January 24. 1873. ' [87]jurisdiction. It gives the Crown absolute power to the extent of the jurisdiction so acquired, and directs all British authorities to conform themselves accordingly. 5. Over and above the direct operation of the Act, the Crown may, by virtue of the Act, appoint persons to exercise the powers conferred by sections 3 to 6 ; it may by virtue of its general prerogative erect Courts for the exercise of the permitted jurisdiction, and it may, by virtue of its prerogative as expressly recognized in the Act, declare the law which is to be administered by its own Courts. 6. The position of affairs between the British and Persian Governments appears to be as follows: For a considerable number of years, apparently extending back to the time when the Arab Chiefs were Governors of Bushire, the British Resident at that place has exercised Civil and Criminal jurisdiction over a certain area. The nature and legal extent of the Criminal jurisdiction does not appear to be very clearly defined. The Civil jurisdiction, however, seems to embrace (a) all cases between British subjects and protected persons (who may be called British clients) ; (b) all cases in which the same classes of persons are defendants; (c) all cases between those classes and others (not being Persian subjects) provided the parties consent; and {d} if a Persian subject is defendant, and a British subject plaintiff, the case is tried in the Persian Courts, but a Residency official may be deputed to watch the proceedings. 7. It has been suggested that the jurisdiction thus exercised is wider than what is authorized by the Treaty of Paris, and that so much of it as is not covered by the Treaty is irregular, and ought to be discontinued. The argument upon which this view is based is that the Treaty of Paris provides that on the establishment and recognition of Consuls- General, Vice-Consuls, and Consular Agents, and in the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade, each contracting party shall be placed on the footing of the most favoured nation; that Russia is the most favoured nation, and that the Russians have no general power of entertaining Civil suits in which Russian subjects are the defendants. But this view appears to us to be erroneous. The fact that the British G-overnment has exercised larger powers of jurisdiction than the Russians only proves that not Russia but Great Britain is the most favoured nation in this respect. There is nothing in the Treaty of Paris which says that the British shall not be the most favoured nation. If the privileges enjoyed by England were less than those accorded to Russia by the Treaty of Turcomanchai, the Treaty of Paris would enlarge them. But if they were already greater that Treaty does not contract them. We are, therefore, of opinion that what Colonel Pelly calls 'the old and irregular practice ' which has been carried on for many years with the knowledge and consent of the Persian Government is perfectly legal, and ought to be continued till altered by Order in Council. 8. As regards Muscat the Treaty of July 1840 says nothing about Criminal juris diction except in one isolated case dealt with by Article 1\ . We assume, however, that the Order in Council * of the 4th November, 1867, is in accordance with the Criminal jurisdiction conferred by usage or sufferance. This Order assumes that the Crown possesses complete Criminal jurisdiction over British subjects, and it gives power to the Consul and the High Court of Bombay to exercise that jurisdiction, each in his allotted province. As regards Civil jurisdiction none is mentioned in the Order except in suits between British subjects, whereas the Treaty of 1840 distinctly provides for nearly the same amount of Civil jurisdiction as exists in Persia. The jurisdiction in Muscat is some what larger in one respect, as under Article Y, if a British subject is pla'ntiff, and the subject of another Christian nation defendant, the suit may be tried by the British authorities, without any consent of the parties, though again it is contracted in respect of the subjects of Mahomedan Powers other than Muscat, 9. The relations of the British Government with the various independent potentates of the Gulf are of the same character as those with Persia; at all events the British Government does not exercise a less amount of jurisdiction in their dominions than in those of Persia. 10. There remains only to be considered the question of jurisdiction in the Turkish possessions bordering on the Gulf. There exists already throughout Turkey an estab lished system of Consular jurisdiction under the control of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, with which it may not perhaps be possible to interfere. If the existing arrangements regarding Turkey do not admit of modification, then Colonel Pelly's advice to establish a single jurisdiction for the whole water and littoral of the Persian and Oman Gulfs must, so far as regards Turkey, be negatived. Otherwise the advice seems to us very sound, and of considerable importance to the working of the system. 11. On this state of facts then we think Colonel Pelly may be advised, that the Draft Order to be framed by himself and by Sir P. Francis should be carefully expressed * See despatch from Secretary of State, dated November 23, 1867.so as not to assume more jurisdiction than is now permitted by the various Foreign lowers; that it should go to the full undoubted extent of that jurisdiction; that the Order in Council for Muscat may be taken as a general guide for the new Order; that as regards Criminal cases it may be closely followed to the extent to which our position admits; that as regards Civil cases the jurisdiction assumed in that Order is narrower than is the jurisdiction in Persia and other places, and the new Order must be modified accort m^Ij as to those places ; and that the new Order should also exnressly modify the Muscat Order in the same way. On the local extent of the Order w'e consider Colonel felly right in trying to embrace into one system the territory he mentions, with exception or . . . ' territory, 'or the reason already given; and it would in our opinion be advisa )i(. to include ivlii. v cat and to modify the .Muscat Order accordingly. In fact the better plan would be to repeal the Muscat Order entirely. 12. itii respect to the important question ot the law to be administered, we are of opinion that tbe same reasons which led to the choice of the Bombay HiHh Court as a Court of Appeal and now the additional fact that such a choice has been made, point to the Jaw ot iiritish India as that which should govern all Civil cases. The Muscat Order r&gt; silem as to the Civil law, so it must be taken that English law prevails there: and the Order will have to be modified again in this respect if Muscat is brought into the arrangement. In speaking of Civil law we do not mean to include procedure, which should be regulated by the principal Judge. 13. It is, however, possible that the introduction of Indian Criminal Law would be unsuitable to the circumstances of the community among whom the law is to work. The Muscat Order gives to the Consul a general power of making regulations for the peace order, and good government of Her Majesty's subjects; of enforcing them by fine' impi isonmont, and banishment; and as to other offences not covered by any regulations it gives similar powers. He also has power to commit to Bombay for trial. But as to offences not covered by regulations nothing is to be deemed an offence which would no! be so deemed by a a Court of Justice having Criminal jurisdiction in Her Majesty's dominions,' which we think must be taken to mean an English Court of Justice. We are, therefore, of opinion, as at present advised, that the better plan would be to follow the Muscat Order in giving the principal Judge (who would probably be the Resident or Consul-general of Bushire) power to make regulations and to provide that, except so far as it may be displaced by Regulation, the Indian Penal Code shall prevail. But the subject is one that must be carefully considered, and on which Colonel Pellv's own opinion will be most important. 14. The third point toi consideration is with regard to the extent of personal iuris- diction to be exeicised under the new arrangements, that is to say, whether the jurisdic tion of the Courts to he established shall be confined to persons born of wholly British paientage, or shall be extended to l?ritish subjects generally. If this (Question were now under consideration for the first time we should be disposed to confine the jurisdiction to certain classes, such as all persons of European extraction, all domiciled in the United Kingdom, and all who aie entitled to British protection, such as persons in the service of Government or seiving on board British ships. But considering that the jurisdiction has hitherto extended to all British subjects, and that the Muscat Order, now five years old. so deals with it, and that no practical mischief has yet been found, we think that there is hardly any case for restricting the personal jurisdiction, even though it is likely hence forth to affect much larger numbers. But we think that the Judges should have a discietion to lemit cases to the Courts ot the country, when they consider that justice can so be better done. . Connected with this point is one which will require attention. Besides British subjec ts, oui jurisdiction has extended to a number ot persons whom we have here called British clients, persons recognized as entitled to our protection, and who appear, in Bushire at least, to be known and registered as such. By the Treaty of Paris (Article XII.), we renounce the right of protecting hereafter any Persian subject not actually m the employment of certain specified officers, provided that no such right is accorded to oi exeiciscd b\ any Foreign Powers: but we are to have as much privilege as the most favoured nation. In defining the classes over which jurisdiction is to be exercised care must be taken not to infringe upon this stipulation. 1G. As regards the nature of the Courts to be constituted, we are of opinion that much discretion must be left to Colonel Pelly to determine this in communication with Sir P. Francis. But we would suggest that the arrangement regarding the Persian shores be kept quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia. The latter must be under the Minister at Teheran and the English Foreign Office. The former should be under m bColonel Pelly and the Government of India. It will, we think, be safer and less likelj to give rise to misunderstanding to give Colonel Pellj the designation of Consul-General or Consul, and his subordinates the designation of Consuls or Yice-Consuls, in addition to the titles of Resident, or Assistant Resident, or Political Agent, as the case may be. Appeals from subordinates in the Gulf should be first to the Resident or Consul-General and then to Bombay. Appeals from Gwadur should, us in the case of the Muscat Con sulate, be to Bombay direct. The general executive control should be with the Govern ment of India, and in this respect we consider that the Muscat Order shoukl be modified. Should a Consul-General be appointed as a Court of Appeal, it is a question for considera tion whether the limits placed by the Muscat Order on the power of fine and imprisonment may not be properly enlarged. 17. In paragraph 2 of your Grace's despatch No. 67C, dated 31st May, 1871, we were instructed to take steps if necessary for procuring from the Rulers of those islands or places in the Persian Gulf, not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Muscat, their assent to the exercise of jurisdiction within their territories. We have not, however, considered it necessary to take any definite action in this matter. Your Grace is aware that the pretensions of Turkey on the Coast of the Persian Gulf are of the most indefinite kind, and that to all the territory which she claims Persia puts forward equal pretensions. The Muscat boundary is indefinite, and has generally contracted or expanded with the strength or weakness of the Wahabee power at Riadk. We consider it most undesirable to raise any questions as to what belongs to Turkey, what to Persia, what to Muscat, and what to none of these Powers, nor in our opinion is any such definition of the territory which is Independent Turkey, Persia, and Muscat at all requisite for the purpose of our jurisdic tion, which, as a matter of fact, is and has long been exercised within the territories of the minor Chiefs, whether claimed by the three greater Powers or not. As our juris diction already exists and is justified by long* usage and sufferance, it appears to us unnecessary to obtain any formal consent from the Chiefs, and inexpedient to cast any doubt upon the validity of our jurisdictioa by applying for such consent. 18. As intimately connected with the subject of Consular jurisdiction in Persia and the Persian Gulf, we would invite your Grace's attention to our despatch No. 7, dated 10th instant, relating to the proposed modification of the Commercial Treaty with Persia. We also solicit consideration of our despatch No. 20 of this date, regarding a proposal put forward by Colonel Pelly for the establishment of a tribunal for the adjudication of cases in which British subjects are plaintiffs and Persian subjects defendants. 19. Your Grace will observe that we have instructed Colonel Pelly, on the comple tion of his duty w 7 ith Sir B. Frere's mission at Zanzibar, to proceed to Constantinople for the purpose of conferring with Sir P. Francis, and of arranging the draft of an Order in Council, on the subject of Consular jurisdiction in Persia and the Gulf. We hope to be favoured by your Grace with an opportunity of considering the draft before it is finally passed. We have, &amp;c. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. The Secretary to the Government of India to the Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Simla, August 25, 1871. WITH reference to the despatch from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India to this Government, No. 67, dated the 31st of May, 1871, a copy of which, and of its enclosures, has been forwarded to the Government of Bombay direct by the Secretary of State, and in continuation of the telegram from this Office, dated the 10th of August, 1871, I am directed to state that, before any further steps are taken in the matter of Consular jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf, the Yiceroy and Governor-General in Council would, be glad to be informed, (1) what is the actual practice at present prevailing in the Gulf as regards jurisdiction in cases where British subjects are concerned; and (2) whether that practice has been found to be attended with any actual ill results. 2. His Excellency in Council also desires to be favoured with the opinion of the Honourable the Governor in Council and the political authorities in the Gulf on the point to what classes of British subjects the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established under the scheme indicated in the Secretary of State's despatch should apply. It seems to his Excellency in Council that there are obvious reasons for refraining from seeking to try the crimes committed by, or adjudicate on the civil claims preferred by or against all, without exception, of that heterogeneous body of men, who, from their parentage orresulcnce in one 01 other of the many Lntish possessions scattered over the world, can claim the lights of British subjects under circumstances which may render it extremely difficult to ascertain how far the claim is well founded. Unless, therefore, good -round he shown for doing otherwise, it would seem to the Governor-General in Council that if on receipt of the report now called for, it he decided to push this matter farther, the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established should be confined to persons born of wholly British parentage. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. The Secretary to the Government of Bombay to the Secretary to the Government of India. r aivt ;r ^ i i i,- n , Bombay Castle, October 2%, \S72. AM dnectcd by his Excellency the Governor in Council to acquaint you that he is now enabled by the receipt of Reports from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to hansmit replies to the three questions propounded in your letter, No. 1808, of the Jotn August, 1871. .nniL 11 ! f ^ 4 f i ret q' est . ion .it may be stated, that when British subjects are n mcd as defendants, the following is the course of proceeding :— P iv (!) i [ U M . usca ] the / ^ ^ e ^ ]t under the Consular jurisdiction enjoyed by the Political Agent under the High Court of Bombay.

In answer to the second question, T am to state that the existing practice has not up to this time been attended with any actual ill results, but that, looking to the changing conditions o society m those regions, it would not be prudent to delay placing matters on a sounder basis. ' 1 &amp; 4. In the 12th paragraph of his letter of the 4th September last, Colonel Pelly has explained his views as to the classes of British subjects to which the jurisdiction of the pi oposed (. ourts should apply, but as the opinion of the Governor in Council on this pom has been invited, his Excellency hopes he maybe permitted to question the expediency or the^ limitation suggested in your letter, viz., 'to persons born of wholly British parentage. Such a restriction might easily deprive a bond fide British subject of le puUection to which he had a lair claim. It may fairly be urged that the very fact ot the existence of what is termed the ' heterogeneous body of men,' spread over the globe as British subjects, affords strong ground for rendering the contemplated Order in Council truly comprehensive and efficient. We have now in Australia, Canada, the Cape, and . ew Zealand, great and increasing communities of undeniable British subjects Germans and other foreigners are establishing themselves there and in India in large numbers, and will undoubtedly intermarry with the resident population. It is hard to t ibCo\ er any sound reason tor depriving the son of a British father and foreign mother of the protectum of the ( and his Excellency is inclined to believe that the extension of the jurisdiction of the Court to all British subjects would not in practice be found to be so inconvenient as seems to be apprehended. The Court might be invested with power to determine the status, for its own purposes, of any one claiming to be a British su )ject. It might be a rule that, whenever a question on that point was raised, it should be determined before entering upon the suit, and that the determination should be final. 1 h? Mini . km Ox I&gt;ritish subjects of importance taking up their residence in Persian and Arabian towns must be imited. Their arrival would generally be known to the British authorities And it would not be difficult for the Court by rule to fix and declare the iiatnio oi the pioots, documentary and others, ot British origin, which they would require m support ot a claim to the protection of the Court. With reference to the Secretary of State's despatch, JSTo. 67, of the 31st May, 1871, I am to state that it will not be necessary to obtain the assent of the rulers of the L fe&lt; J C6 territories in the Persian Gulf not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Muscat, as by usage and sufferance the British Government has long exercised and does exercise the jurisdiction over British subjects now in contemplation. In conclusion, his Excellency in Council would submit for the consideration of the Governor-General in Council, that the time has arrived at which Colonel Pelly may, with advantage, proceed to Constantinople to confer with Sir Philip Francis as proposed in a previou^Tcorrespondence. He will then have it in is power to discuss with him the best mode of dealing with cases in which British subjects may be plaintiffs and Persians defendants, a matter to which he attaches must importance. Inclosure 4 in ]S r o. 1. Colonel Pellij to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Camp, Mandanee, March 11, 1871. 'REFERRING to my letter, dated 22nd October, 1870, and previous correspondence, concerning the introduction of Consular or other jurisdiction in Persia. I have now the honour to'submit a copy of a letter T have received from Her Majesty's Consul-General and Judge at Constantinople on this subject, together with a copy of my reply. 2. The Rio-ht Honourable the Governor in Council will observe that I have carefully refrained from giving any opinion in regard to questions which affect localities beyond the regions committed to this Residency. ^ . 1 1 It seemed to me that to give such opinion, unless under the special orders of Government, might lay me open to the charge of presumption and otherwise prove inconvenient. * Inclosure 5 in No. 1. Sir P. Francis to Colonel Pelly. Constantinople, December 27, 1870. I HAYE been directed by Her Majesty's Government to put myself in com munication with you with a view of drafting an Order in Council applicable to Persia, I have read the various despatches and documents sent to me on the subject, among which I find one from you of the date of 30th October 1866, addressed to the late Mr. Loo ie. In continuation of this correspondence allow me to send you some preliminary remarks founded on your and other letters, and to beg to send me your comments and suggestions in return. I propose that in the Order iu Council it shall be ordered — 1. That Consular Officers in Persia shall be invested with the power of hearing certain civil and criminal matters in which British and protected subjects are interested. 2. That the Resident (or by his appointment the Assistant Resident) at Bush ire shall likewise hold Court for the administration of justice, including maritime cases. 3. That the other Assistant Residents (and Consular Officers, if any) shall possess like authorities. t &gt; - j ^ / j 4. That there should be appeal in certain cases from the Assistant Residents (and Consular Officers, if any) in the district under your jurisdiction to the Resident. 5. That in those cases the Court of Final Appeal should be Bombay. 6. That the Consuls and Yice-Consuls not included in the above paragraph, viz., Tabreez and Reshd, should likewise have the same judicial powers and hold Courts of First Instance. ,r. • . i. i • 7. That at Teheran a Court should be held either by the Minister or by his deputation, the Secretary of Legation or Vice-Consul. , ,, , , . 8.

That assessors may occasionally (especially in cases wlien protected subjects are involved in the suit) be drawn from foreigners. . at u 10. That the place for prolonged imprisonment should be either at Malta orBombay. But that Her Majesty's Government should send hereafter general directions on this head, and in respect of particular cases special orders as to the carrying out of sentences of long imprisonment. I should he glad to hear from you on the above points and any others connected with the projected Order in Council. Tnclosure 6 in No. 1. Colonel Pelly to Sir P. Frances. Camp, Mandanee, March 11, 1871. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 27th of December last, concerning the drafting of an Order in Council applicable to Persia, and inviting niy comments and suggestions on certain points in regard thereto. 2. I beg to concur with you in regard to point No. 1. 3. As regards points 2 and 3, I think that the Assistants Resident in their proper capacities should be invested with the powers of a Consul, and maritime cases should be included. 4. As regards points 4 and .5 I concur with you in thinking that appeal in certain cases should lie from the Assistants Resident to the Resident, and that the Court of Final Appeal should lie to such authority or Court in India as the Governments of Bombay and India may determine. 5. But if the Order in Council limit its provisions to Persian territory, it would, in so far as the jurisdiction of this Residency is concerned, provide for only one littoral oi the Persian Gulf, whereas a large number, and indeed the majority ot cases, arise along the Arab littoral. If possible, it would I think be very desirable that the Order in Council should include all such regions as may be included within the Residents jurisdiction. 6. As regards points 7 and 8, as the regions therein referred to lie without my jurisdiction, I fear I might incur the charge of presnmption were I to give an opinion concerning their Courts and jurisdictions. 7. As regards point 9 I think that the power of appointing Assessors would prove very useful, and that the Assessors in any and all cases might be drawn from foreigners if found desirable. 8. As regards point 10 I think the place for prolonged imprisonment for prisoners sent from the Gulf should be determined by higher authority in India, who might deem it advisable to vary the point of imprisonment. 9- I beg to inclose copy of extract from a letter which 1 have had the honour ot addressing to the Government of Bombay, under date -2nd October last, as T deem it possible that these paragraphs may prove of use to you when preparing the Order in Council. 10. I think it would be advisable to provide for the levy of fees in Civil suits. At present no fee is levied. But as trade increases it is found that vexatious and unnecessary plaints increase also. The levy of fees would probably tend to reduce the number ot this class of claims. 11. !Since writing the above I have received from a firm in Bushire an application for the appointment of Yice-Consul in Bushire. The appointment of a local Agent under the Residency might be advisable in this principal seaport of Persia !or mercantile transactions. 12. From a previous similar application from the same firm I learn that they ' are desirous of obtaining the appointment not so much with a view to personal remuneration for the discharge of its duties as for the indirect benefits it would confer on their firm as merchants.' But of course the first object is to arrange the general question, w r hich might include provision for the appointments of Agents, with A'ice-Consular powers, by the Resident. P.S.—Our interests in these regions being mainly British-Indian and the bulk of Brisish subjects here trading or residing being British-Indian or connected with India, I am of opinion that the otficials of this Residency should remain wholly subordinate to the Indian Governments. Constituting this jurisdiction in part in subordination to the Foreign Office, and in8 part in subordination to the Indian authorities, would, I apprehend, lead to confu&amp;ion and delays, and occasionally even to conflict in instructions. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Mr. Mackenzie to Colonel Pelly. Bushire, March 7, 1871. SOME months ago I had the pleasure to address you regarding the appointment of a Vice-Consul at this port, and you were then so good as to forward my letter to the Bombay Government. Believing the subject to be still under the consideration of Government, I again trouble you with a view to keeping open the application I then made. Having in my former letter stated fully the benefits that would result to trade were such an office established in the Gulf, it is unnecessary my now again doing so. I am the more desirous of securing the appointment for a member of my firm, Gray, Paul, and Co., as an American gentleman who recently visited Persia had instructions to communicate to the Minister of his Government at Constantinople the names of the most influential merchants at this port with a view to the appointment of an American Consul. The rapid progression of trade in the Gulf within the past few years has been greatly stimulated by the energy displayed by Her Majesty's.Political Officers in the settlement of traders' disputes on both coasts, so that a feeling of confidence has been engendered in commercial transactions which previously had no existence. It is, however, apparent to us that the creation of a Consular Office here, solely for the regulation of commerce, would at once facilitate trade and relieve the residency of the minor details of mercantile and shipping questions.

REFERRING to my letter of the 6th May, 1871, I have the honour to inclose a copy of a letter I have received from Her Majesty's Judge and Consul-Gencral at Constantinople, again expressing his opinion that it would he advantageous there should be personal communication between him and me. Inclosure 12 in No. 1. Sir P. Francis to Colonel Pelly, Constantinople, April 8, 1871. I HAVE perused your remarks, dated 25th February, on my despatch of 27th December last, but have not yet seen a copy of your despatch to the Indian Government on the Persian jurisdiction. The subject requires careful and grave consideration, and I have no doubt that I should be able to carry out the object of Her Majesty's Government much more satis factorily if I could have the advantage of personal communication with you, I should be glad if the India Office were aware that this is my opinion. Inclosure 13 in No. 1. Colonel Pelly to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Bahrein, December 14, 1871. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Government Resolutions, dated 30th September, 1871, calling on me to report, for the information of the Govern ment of India, on the three following points :— 1st. 'What is the actual practice at present prevailing in the Gulf as regards juris diction in cases where British subjects are concerned. 2nd. ' Whether that practice has been found to be attended with any actual ill results. 3rd. 'To what classes of British subjects the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established under the scheme, indicated in the Secretary of State's despatch No. 67 of 31st May, 1871, should apply.' 2. As regards points 1st and 2nd I think I have already submitted all that occurs to me in my Report of the 22nd October, 1870. Briefly I may repeat that I have been instructed by Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran that the question of Consular jurisdiction is under consideration, and, therefore, pending the introduction of such jurisdiction, any judicial inquiries which may be instituted by British authority in Persia must be liable to the inconveniences attending decisions given without jurisdiction. 3. The despatch of the Secretary of State of the 31st of May, 1871, does not appear to have been received in this office. 4. As I have before submitted, it does not seem to me that any change in the desig nation of my appointment, or that of my assistants, is necessary; what seems wanted is that we should be invested with adequate and lawful authority for the discharge of judicial functions devolving on us ; and, secondly, that there should be unity of authority, whether local or controlling. 5. On this question of jurisdiction I would invite attention to the correspondence which passed between Her Majesty's Consul-General and Judge at Constantinople and myself. A copy of this correspondence was submitted to Government with my letter of the 11th of March, 1871. 6. My respectful opinion is (and it is one, I believe, in which Sir Philip Francis concurs N i that the speediest and most effectual method of proceeding in this matter would be for me to meet him in Constantinople, when he could draft the proposed Order in Council, aided by my local knowledge and experience. I believe that a month thus passed at Constantinople would advance the subject under discussion more than it has been advanced in the five years and a half which have elapsed since Government first instructed me to place myself in ccmmunication with Her Majesty's Judge and Consul- [871 ' V D10 General at Constantinople. Of course I should not move until current duties in the Gulf permitted.* P S.—The foregoing letter was written in December last, but, expecting to proceed shortly to British India (whether on leave or otherwise) I delayed sending my letter, in the hope of an opportunity for an interview with higher authority. It will be obvious to Government that, apart from what I have alluded to in the above communication, and in previous letters ot greater length, there are many con siderations which require to be borne in mind;— (1.) That my charge is not wholly or principally in Persia; and that what is required in respect to this Residency is authority to treat civil and criminal matters which may have place at any point—whether Arabian or Persian or Turkish—round the shore-line of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman, and whether these matters may happen as between British subjects, or (as they tar more frequently do happen) between a British subject and a native. (2.) That if the intention be to provide for Consular jurisdiction in Persia generally. Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran would seem to be the official who, by his position in the country and by his relations to Her Majesty's Foreign Office, would be best qualified for determining what rules and provisions may be required. (3.) That I be empowered to delegate Consular duties at any particular point to one of my Assistants, as occasion may from time to time require; at present I am continually hampered by these small questions, particularly at Bushire. Our political relations round the two Gulfs are my proper charge. (4.) That the position of this Residency in relation to Her Majesty's Foreign Office and its officers should be determined. This, however, is a subject on which I had parti cularly desired to communicate orally with higher authority in India, for I still hope to do so, and the subject could not be treated in a postscript penned just as the Mail-steamer is starting. Inclosure 14 in No. 1. Colonel Pelly to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Bushire, September 4, 1872. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Government Resolution dated 3rd August, 1872, and which reached me by the Mail now arrived from Bombay. 2. I observe— First, that his Excellency in Council expresses his regret at the delay which occurred in the submission of my Report dated 14th December, 1871, with postscript of 17th June, 1872. Secondly, that his Excellency in Council calls on me to supply without any further delay my opinion on the question of what classes of British subjects the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established in Persia, under the scheme indicated in the Secretary of State's despatch of the 31st May, 1871, should apply. 3. As regards the delay which occurred in submitting my Report, I would respect fully summarize the peculiar circumstances in which I have been placed since the date of my receiving the Government Resolution of the 30th September. 1871, which called for report. 4. Those circumstances have been already reported in detail, but in papers widely scattered through the records. They are briefly as follows :— 5. The Resolution was addressed to me at Bushire simultaneously with my being instructed by telegram to proceed to the Arab coast. The Resolution tound me, on the 21st October, at Muscat, and at a moment when I was prostrated with sickness and on the point of leaving for India. Proceeding to Gwadur, en route, \ telegraphed my con dition to Government, who, in reply, telegraphed back, instructing me to proceed at once to Bahrein on emergent duty. At the same time I received a telegram from Bushire, intimating the death of my Assistant the late Major Smith. 1 considered that, at what ever risk to my own life, I could not but return to Bahrein. I did so accordingly, and was occupied there with Her Majesty's ships until the 17th or 18th December. It was then I found my first opportunity of access to my records, and 1 at once acknowledged the Government Resolution.-}- But, as my strongest opinion lay in repeating a suggestion * Vide letter of Mr. Secretary Gonne of July 30, 1866. •f' Vide my letters dated May 6, May 20, and December 14, 1871.I had previously made towards a meeting between Sir P. Francis and myself at Constan tinople, it appeared to me that I should most thoroughly explain myself to Government if, instead of submitting my Report and leaving them to resolve on it, I should take it with me to Bombay and Simla, to which places I purposed proceeding on being granted a privilege leave, which 1 had been seeking for the past four years, and which I had again applied for on my return to Bushire from Bahrein. 6. The privilege leave being granted to me, I was about to depart; but, in the interim, question after question pressed on me, which in my judgment seemed to render it niy duty to postpone quitting my post.* Meantime [ was again suddenly ordered to Muscat, where my duties were scarcely concluded when emergent telegrams reached me to proceed with Her Majesty's ships to Sohar and threaten bombardment. 7. Thus, by a succession of circumstances which 1 could not foresee, I found myself in the dilemma of having to elect between, firstly, proceeding on my privilege leave and thence prosecuting the jurisdiction question at Constantinople; or, secondly, remaining at my poat till I could see my way clear in the numerous immediate questions pressing on me.f 8. It is unnecessary to submit that, in so far as my own health and convenience were concerned, I could not have hesitated in electing the first course; and if I acted on the second it could only have been from a sense of my duty to Government and the public interests. 9. Still hoping, however, from Mail to Mail, that I might be enabled to leave by the next Mail, I kepi my Report by me until one day 1 accidently learned by telegraph that the question had been mooted in Parliament in the Foreign Department, i then considered that I could no longer detain my Report, and, adding a postscript to it, I despatched it. 10. As regards the question as to what class of British subjects the Jurisdiction Act should apply, and with reference also to the remarks of his Excellency in Council on this matter, 1 would most deferentially submit that the despatch of the Secretary ot State had not reached me and has not yet reached me. The despatch now received in copy, with the Government Resolution under acknowledgment, is not the despatch of 31st May, but a despatch of the 30th jSTovember, 1871, concerning the character and habits of liberated African slaves. 11. The Resolution, however, points out that although T had not received a copy of the despatch of the 31st May, 1871, I had received a copy of the Indian Govenment letter of the 25th August, 187 t, in which the object of the question is clearly stated. But I would respectfully submit that the letter of the 25th August, 1871, almost seems to answer its own question, as it concludes with the following words: ' That unless good ground be shown for doing otherwise, the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established should be confined to persons born wholly of British parentage.' 12. However, I would now venture to submit that the jurisdiction ot the Courts should in my opinion exclude all matters, whether civil or criminal, in which persons born of foreign parentage are concerned as defendants; in other words the mere accident of a person of foreign parentage having been born within British India or other British territory, or the fact of a person of foreign parentage having received letters ox Consular protection should not entitle that person to the jurisdiction ot the Court. But persons born of wholly British parentage (strictly so understood) and also persons hond^ Jide born of British-Indian parentage should, I think, be included in the jurisdiction ot the Court. 1 think also that on grounds of policy and equity those persons who, although foreigners by parentage, receive British protection prior to our Treaty with Persia of 3 857 should also be included in the jurisdiction of the Court. This class is not numerous' and is insusceptible of being added to under our present Treaty relations. 13. But it appears to me that whatever may be enacted in this matter it would be advisable to avail ourselves of past experience. Clauses which read clear and equitable sotiaetimes fail in the working; in the present instance w r e have ?n examplar in the Courts in Turkey.{ What Sir Robert Phillimore calls the immiscibility of the Christian and Mahomedan in Turkey applies at least equally to Persia, and I think the safest course would be for some officer, wiih local experience in Persia, to be associated with the Judge * Karoon River Question.

This is the course I have already more than once suggested. 14. So far as this Residency is concerned I would again draw attention to the fact that what is required is first— An Order in Council or other authoratative document investing the Resident with legal jurisdiction round the whole littoral, whether Arabian, Persian, or other, and on the waters of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman. 15. I cflnnot conclude this Report without once more earnestly soliciting the attention of higher authority to the desirability of a modification in the Commercial* Treaty with Persia. It may be argued this subject is irrelevant to the one under discussion. Rut in my deferential opinion the question of cases wherein British subjects or proteges are plaintifs and Persian subjects defendants is kindred to the question on which T am now reporting. Practice indeed in some instances shows the two questions to be curiously and perplexingly intermixed. 16. Jurisdiction of the character contemplated in the Government Resolution is doubtless desirable, and with time must become increasingly so. But some arrangement under which British subjects and proteges may be enabled with confidence to prosecute their claims against Persian subjects is in my opinion essential to the development of trade and to the interests of our subjects. 17. I understand that in Turkey this necessity is provided for by a sort of mixed Mercantile Board, and I think that if T or any other officer be ordered to Constantinople, this subject should form a part of the discussions to be carried on between Sir Phillip Francis and myself or the officer deputed. 18. In conclusion, I respectfully trust that on a perusal of the above explanation, his Excellency in Council will feel assured that the delay in the submission of my Report was caused by no carelessness or want of zeal, but was induced by a complication of circumstances among which T acted to the best of my poor ability and judgment, I would further beg that the delay so attributable to me, and which extends over exactly six months, dating from the 14th December last, may be considered as wholly separate from delay of six years which had previously occurred, and for which I am in no way accountable, and with the causes of which I am indeed imperfectly acquainted. But I am aware that in 1863-64 I verbally pointed out the want of jurisdiction, and that under date the i^rd October, 1866, I reported on the question. Inclosure 15 in INo. 1.

B\ the mail just now arrived at Bushire, I have had the honour of receiving your memorandum, dated the 3rd instant, transmitting to me the despatch of the Secretary of State ot the 3 1 . st May, 1871, with accompaniments marginally noted.f 2. I remark that the 4tli paragraph of the Government Resolution of the 3rd August, 1872, read as follows :— 'The third question, viz., to what classes of British subjects the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established under the scheme indicated in the Secretary of State's despatch ot 31st May, 1871, should apply has received no answer whatever from Colonel Pelly, on the ground that this despatch had not been communicated to him. Colonel Pelly had, however, received a copy of the Government of India's letter of 25th August, 1871, in which the object of the question is clearly stated; he should now be furnished with a copy of the despatch referred to, and requested to supply the opinion required without any further delay.' 3. 1 deferentially submit, however, that there would seem to exist a misapprehension in tne mind of his Excellency in Council concerning the tenor of these two despatches ; and J or facility of reference 1 now beg to append copies of both despatches prepared in parallel columns; also a copy of an extract from one of the accompaniments to the despatch of the Secretary of State. 4.

Unless, therefore, good ground be shown for doing otherwise, it would seem to the Governor-General in Council that if, on receipt of the report now called for, it be decided to push this matter further, the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established should be confined to persons born of wholly British parentage. cation with a view to the settlement of the question of Consular jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf. 2.

But a question has arisen as to the extent to which it is necessary to obtain the concurrence of the Persian Government, before any further proceedings are taken by Her Majesty's Government. The Treaty of Paris (1857), Article IX, says: 'The High Contracting Parties engage that, in the establishment and recognition of Consuls-General, Consuls, Vice- Consuls, and Consular Agents, each shall be placed in the dominions of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation ; and that the treatment of their respective subjects16 am] their trade, shall also, in every respect, be placed on the footing of the subjects and commerce of the most favoured nation,' T b e question tlien is as to what are the rights and privileges of the most favoured Rations. he i reaty of 1 oorkomanchai declares that Consuls maybe posted wheresoever '■ the interests of commerce' may require. But it is obvious that there may ho differences of opinion between the Government of His Majesty the Shah and the Government oi Her Majesty the Queen as to the requirements of commerce in Persian territory. ,' t ... ls ' T , ,, ' el ' e(o . re ' expedient that, before the report of Sir Arnold Kemball and fT iR ra ';; 18 18 completed, they should be fully informed, with respect to the views ot Ijord Granville, as to the rights and privileges of the British Government accordinir to existing Treaties. b I am, &amp;c.

LN pursuance of the instructions of Her Majesty's Govern ment we have considered the best means of giving effect to the Foreign .Jurisdiction Act in the Persian dominions and in the States and territories bordering the Persian Gulf. In so doing we have necessarily assumed, whilst discussing the provisions of the Orders in Council required for the purpose, that Her Majesty is empowered, by sufferance or usage, or under Treaty stipulations, to delegate jurisdic tion to her representatives in the above-named countries. 2. So far as Treaties are concerned, Articles IX and XII of the Treaty of Peace of 1857 limit Her Majesty's powers of jurisdiction in Persia to the extent to which they may be accorded to the most- favoured nation, and these are to be found specifically defined b-\ Articles V I I and VIII of the Treaty of 1828, concluded between Russia ami Persia at Turcomanchai. {Vide also the Treaties more recently contracted by Persia with other European Powers, and more notably with Germany, Articles fll and XI to XVII inclusive.) 3. The extent to which jurisdiction has been exercised under sufferance and usage is set forth in the 6th and 7th paragraphs of the despatch of the Government of India, No. 12 of 24th January 1870. As there described civil jurisdiction on the Persian littoral, at least, of the Persian Gulf, corresponds so closely with the actual conditions of the same jurisdiction in Turkey, that the Order in Council which constitutes the basis of the one may very readily be adopted to legalize the exercise of the other. In the interior too of Persia the privileges so acquired would seem to be as fully confirmed as on the Persian littoral, for although it were true, as alleged in the despatch.29 Remarks by Mr. Herman Merivale. In criminal cases, I presume.—(See first part of paragraph 9 of Report). ^ Not without a new Treaty, a third Power (Turkey) being concerned.—(See last sen tence of paragraph 9 of Report). I do not quite understand this sentence. —(See paragraph 8 of Report, as follows: -—That where (as in the territories men tioned) the status of the Consular Body, and the determination of the course of appeal, and of the law to be administered, are common to the exercise of iurisdic- tion.' Reply of Sir A. Kemhall. riority of the British Indian Criminal Code, as a code, is generally allowed. Any of its provisions deemed specially applicable to India must be in an equal or even greater degree applicable to Persia. The suggestion of paragraph 21 was intended, if approved, to supersede the pro posals of paragraph 10, which dealt exclu sively with the Consular body, as at present constituted. The objection to an Assistant Resident hearing appeals from his own decisions might otherwise have been urged, with even greater force, to his hearing appeals from the decisions of his official superior, the Resident. If a superior judicial officer were nomi nated to Bushire, he would hold the same position there, precisely, that was held by Sir E. Hornby when appointed Vice-Consul and Judge at Constantinople. His jurisdic tion would be appellate for all other Courts within the prescribed limits, but original for Bushire, subject, of course, to the right of appeal in both cases to the Privy Council. The judicial functions of the Resident would be cancelled, as a matter of course (the duties oi that officer being mainly political), whether or not it were found practicable to combine in one person the offices of Judge and of Assistant Resident. In any case, the Judge might undertake at Busliire all the purely Consular duties hitherto per formed by the Resident or his Assistant, and his relations with the Residency would be on the same footing as those of the Judge, and, now, Consul-General at Con stantinople, with Her Majesty's Embassy.

The most favoured nation in Persia I conceive to be at present Russia; and the poweis of jiiiisdiction accorded to her are specified in Articles VII and VIII of the Commercial Treaty of Poorkomanchai. The investigation and settlement of all claims and disputes between Russian subjects arc thereby entirely confined to the Legation or to the ( onsuls of Russia and are to be decided according to the laws and practice of Uussia. I he same mode of procedure is to be observed with reference to disputes and thoreto anSmg Veen Russlan a,ld other foreign subjects provided the parties consent So far the subject does not appear to require any remark. But with reference to cases between foreign and Persian subjects, I believe that iisaire has superseded the terms of the Treaty in question; for, instead of their being e eired, as therein stipulated, to the Hakim, or Governor, for investigation and decision the course adopted has been, for many years past, to refer for investigation and decision Jh/;«flTf IVe frr .W 10 V r , Co, ? sulate ^es wherein the foreign subject was &lt; l&lt; lernlant, and to the Minister ior loreign Affairs m the capital or his representative „ provinces cases wherein the foreign subject was the plaintiff. If a satisfactory settlement is not obtained by this means, a reference is made—and this is of very frequent occurrence-from the provinces to the Capital where the matter is discussed betw een the foieign Legation and the Persian Government. If they cannot agree, the oreign Representative lays the case before his own Government. rn ^ re ^ ams ,vl . th Her Majesty's Government to decide whether the terms of the r the . P racti ce which has for so long a time been established is to form the basis of the Order m Council which it w proposed to apply to Persia. I quite concur in the opinion expressed by Sir Arnold Kemball, that British subjects should not be relin- quished to the chances of Persian judicial administration. c,. ' im . ot . 0 P in,on thafc the system of British Consular jurisdiction throughout the Shah s domimons should, as a general rule, be subjected to English law, with appeal to J e iran, the only exception being with reference to cases arising on the Persian Littoral and islands in which British natives of India are alone concerned. Such cases might be better adjudicated by the Resident at Bushire in accordance with British Indian law, with appeal to Bombay. ' ™ w U r 1 ' 1 , }l -' therefore to confer Consular and Vice-Consular Commissions on Hei Majestys Resident and on the Assistant-Residents in the Persian Gulf: and also to attach to Her Majesty s Legation at Tehran a Legal Consul. A well-selected officer tos tins appointment would be indispensable to advise Her Majesty's Minister and Consul-Genera m deciding cases which could not be satisfactorily settled by the Consular Courts m the provinces. He might also be very usefully employed in occa- smnally visiting, when necessary, the towns in which native mission Agents reside such as Meshed, Astrabad, Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, and Shiraz. 1 think that the Turkish Order in Council would form a suitable basis for the Order in Council proposed for Persia, having in view, however, the limited number of British subjects residing in Persia. For this reason 1 would not contemplate, at present, the appointment of a Judffe, which would necessitate an expensive establishment. As I have above suggestedTit would suffice to attach to this Legation a Legal Consular Officer. 1 J' cypress my entire concurrence in the remarks contained in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Keport drawn up by Sir Philip Francis and Sir Arnold Kemball, as to the advantages to be derived from the establishment of Mixed Tribunals for the adjudication defendants' 111 Sub j ects are P laintiff s a nd Persian, or other foreigners, I am of opinion that great inconvenience would arise if an Appellate Court were31 r T f f'; lssurc&lt; } th f Persian Government would not consent cases referred to the Capital being decided on appeal in a provincial town.

A s . lc S ai ^ s British jurisdiction in Persia, Mr. Thomson asserts that Her Majesty's powers m respect of the investigation of all claims and disputes between Her Majesty's subjects (without distinguishing civil and criminal cases) are fully established and are bo recognized also in respect ot disputes and claims arising between British and other foreign subjects m Persia, ' provided the parties consent thereto.' . ih ^ Vlews ot f Vlr - Hiomson in these important respects would seem to dispense with the necessity ot any re erence to the Persian Government, and if approved bv Her ;■ aj p y ^ ' urerin nent would admit ot the preparation of the proposed Order in Council for l eisia w ithout further delay. I his Order, being based on the Turkish Order in Council, would contain nothing to debar us either from using existing privileges or from participating under the most-tavoured-nation clause in any privileges that may be conceded to other toreign Powers in that country. Its effect would be merely to by Treaty to^Her Majesty'! the eXerCise 0f ajunsdiction alread y Pertaining • ^ Under the same view of Treaty concessions, Her Majesty's right to appoint Consuls t ? M ,a C''' 1 not.be disputed. The issue, therefore, of Consular Commissions to Her Majesty s Residents and Assistant Residents in the Persian Gulf, as well as the nomination ot a Legal Consul to Teheran in the manner suggested by Mr Thomson discretion med advi3ablc ' would belong exclusively to Her Majesty's But with reference to cases between foreign and Persian subjects, Mr. Thomson while admitting that the right ot jurisdiction, so tar from being conferred, is barred by lieat.v stipulations,^ believes that 'usage has superseded the terras of the Treaty between Russia and I ersia, which provides tor their adjudication. After detailing, then, the action enstoraarily taken by English and Russian Representatives in such cases, he leaves it to Her Majesty's Government 'to decide whether the terms of the Treaty or the practice which has for so long a time been established, is to form the basis of the Order in Council which it is proposed to apply to Persia.' It is with respect to these cases that difficulties present themselves which need to be considered, the advantage to British subjects of the privileges assured to them by usage and prescnp mn, when engaged as defendants in suits with Persians, cannot be overrated, and ought, no doubt, in the interest of all foreigners residing in such a » No. 10. ia332 country as Persia to be zealously preserved. The machinery, however, by means of which they have hitherto been exercised being adapted to a very limited society, would be wholly inadequate to the circumstances and requirements of an increasing community, or to the more extended development of commercial relations with Persia. It was, indeed, the inconvenience and responsibility attending the extra-judicial discussion of complicated cases under appeal, as described by Mr. Thomson, involving endless correspondence, with constant references to England ; and the need, therefore, of some more regular system of adjudication, that led, in Turkey, under similar circumstances, to the establishment of Foreign Consular Courts supplemented by Mixed Tribunals. Before these Tribunals the foreigner acquired the right of summoning Turkish subjects, and the several nationalities being there represented, the litigant's Consul or his deputy having the right of attending to watch proceedings, the evidence being duly recorded, and procedure and judgment regulated by a written Code, the anomalies of Mahommedan law and jurisprudence were thereby superseded in his favour. So far, however, as cases between ■ foreigners exclusively are concerned, submission to these Tribunals rests, F presume, on common consent, with the alternative obligation only, on the part of the plaintiff, of recourse to the National Consular Court of the defendant. In expressing, therefore, his concurrence as to the advantages to be derived from the establishment of similar Mixed Tribunals in Persia, Mr. Thomson may not have meant, as his words imply, to restrict their action to the adjudication of cases 44 in which British subjects are plaintiffs, and Persians, or other foreigners, defendants/' So one-sided a condition would hardly be acceptable to Persia or to other foreign States. These States, including Persia, might fairly require reciprocity on behalf of their subjects respectively, and might justly object to British subjects, as plaintiffs, being entitled to prosecute their claims in the new Tribunals, if, in their turn, as defendants in mixed suits, they were not held to be amenable to the same Tribunals. In practice, nevertheless, the option is still recognized, in Turkey, to belong to a plaintiff in such suits, of submitting his claim to the judgment of the national Consular Court of the defendant. Even as defendant, the Turkish subject, I understand, not unfrequently exercises the same option (under proper securities for assent and conformity), in spile of the discouragement which, on principle, is offered thereto by the Ottoman authorities. Judgment in the latter case would assume the form of arbitration, and would not of course be subject to appeal. Thus, in mixed civil cases the system obtaining in Turkey might be introduced into Persia as realizing, with added elficacy, though in a modified form, the privileges acquired in the latter country ; but in criminal cases, I apprehend that the prosecution of the offender, being a British subject, in a British Consular Court, must under any cir cumstances, as heretofore, be rendered imperative. Considering the nature of Mahomedan jurisprudence and the state of prisons, or more correctly speaking the complete want of prison organization, in Persia, the British subject could not be relinquished to the chances of native judicial administration ; nor would the continued jurisdiction of British Consular Officers over British subjects accused of criminal offences affect, as in civil cases, the rights and interests of Persian subjects, or of other foreigners. In any case, however, I am not aware that the existence of an Order in Council would add to, or detract from, the privileges, under review. These privileges rest avowedly upon usage and prescription, and the Order in Council would partake in no degree of the character of a Treaty or Convention, which should be binding on the Persian Government. Its only effect would be to legalize the judicial functions and to regulate the powers and procedure of Her Majesty's Consular representatives without imposing on the Persian Government any obligation to respect its provisions, save in their application exclusively to British subjects. The Order in Council, moreover, could not influence the establisment of Mixed Tribunals as above constituted. These Tribunals must be initiated by the Persian Government, with due notice given to, if not with the concert and consent of, the principal European Powers having Treaty relations with Persia. As regards the appointment of a Judge, or Superior Judicial Officer, and the law to be administered in Persia, I have nothing to add to the remarks contained in the Report and Appendix ; it must rest with Her Majesty's Government to decide whether or not, on the ground of economy, preference should be given to Mr. Thomson's proposal to attach a legal Consular Officer to Her Majesty's Legation at Tehran, who in his own proper person, or rather, it seems, in the name, and as the organ of Her Majesty's Minister should exercise an original jurisdiction for the capital, and an appellate jurisdiction for every other consular district in the country; ' f the only exception,'' as suggested by Mr. Thomson, 41 being with reference to cases arising in the Persian littoral and islands in which British natives of India are alone concerned. Such cases might be better33 WeaUo C Bo!X.) h ' EeSident at Bushire ' in accordance with British-Indian Law with a d m i^l?lwr t i 0 1 , n ^ erereCUrS T 1 submitted 111 the Report, whether snch exception be ' ^ 0 ?® alKl t ' ,e same system of law must not be instituted for all parts ol the Persian uomimons without regard to the class of British subjects who might come under its operation. It will be observed that the arrangement proposed 'by ! 1 Jaomsou invohes the administration of two systems of law and procedure bv one and the same officer, subject to appeal to England or to Bombay, according as the parties to the suit were Britisb-born or British-Indian subjects; and in mixed cases of most probable occurrence m which both classes of British subjects should be concerned, mi-ht give use to complications It is true that these complications could be anticipated ^by icquumg the one law or the other and the consequent course of appeal to be determined by consent or to foUow the class of the defendant. But the question is not devoid of difficulties, and it was with the view of simplifying procedure generally (seeing that the Pnnc.paht.es of the Arab.an coast of the Persian Gulf are included within the jurisdiction of Hei Majestys Resident and Assistant-Residents, whose jurisdiction in those Principalities, as at Muscat, G wadur, and Zanzibar, must be governed by British-Indian L, h nith appeal to Bombay),'that the Report advocated the. extension of the same Law to the interior of Persia with the appointment of a Judge of Appeal at Bushire. a Vi i l llomson » ^ think, proceeds on a misconception in supposing; that 'if an Appellate Court were established at Bushire the Persian Government would not consent to cases referred to the Capital being decided on appeal in a provincial town.' Whatever imS U f i 6 of Her Majesty's Government respecting Appellate Jurisdiction, it vumld not legitimately afford ground for umbrage to the Persian Government. The pjovisioHs of the Order m Council would be binding only on British authorities and British subjects in Persia, and dealing with suits between British subjects exclusively or between Br^ish subjects and Persians, or foreigners voluntarily submitting their claims a hutish junsdichon must depend, m respect of the course of appeal, not less than of the law to be administered, upon the good will and pleasure of Her Majesty ;rom the Mixed Tribunals, on the other hand, appeal, if appeal were allowed, must rnn ril V ° f a ^cognized High Court or Judicial Council at the Capital, to the 1 ersian Executive Government, subject only in cases in which a British subject may be concerned to the cognizance and control of Her Majesty's Minister Mr. 1 homson makes no allusion in his despatch to the question of the territorial fx T 1 ? p nd 1 Klslmr - , Inasmu ch, however, as he recommends that the ^Cbident and Assistant Lesidents m the Persian 'Gulf should be vested with authority i T l&gt;ntlsl ^ ln ^ ian Law &gt; exceptionally on the Persian littoral and islands, which law, as above stated, must prevail in all the other territories bordering the Persian Ouif he has probably assumed that question to be immaterial to the terms and con- Ructions of the proposed Order in Council Under his view the distinctive operation territori^ would affect individual persons, and need not be defined I trust that the question of deportation, not less important in Persia than in Turkey may not be overlooked in the preparation of the proposed Order in Council In conclusion I respectfully suggest that Mr. Thomson's despatch, with the above remaiks, be forwarded for the consideration of Sir Philip Francis at Constantinople.

IN obedience to your Lordship's instructions (March 4, No. 11) 1 have now to . submit my remarks on Mr. Taylour Thomson's despatch of December 31, 1873, relating to the subject of the proposed Order in Council for regulating Consular jurisdiction in Persia. Mr. Thompson, in explaining what is the course of litigious procedure according to the present practice in Persia, where Europeans appear as parties, points out that the practice is based upon 'usage,' and not on the stipulations of Treaties. According to his statement, the principles in force for the selection of Tribunals for suits where foreigners and natives of Persia are parties, present striking anomalies. The application of the rule with which one is familiar in Turkey of actor sequitur forum rei is an evil which is only tolerated in that country because, unfortunately, no better rule or compromise has hitherto been found. In Persia it seems that the same rule is sought to be followed, but upon it is fastened the additional disadvantage of there being, in truth, no ' forum.' When, for example, an Englishman is a defendant in Persia, it would seem that the suit is not tried, but is ' referred ' to the English Legation or Consulate, and becomes a matter of correspondence, polemical or peaceful, as the case may be; whilst, on the other hand, if the defendant be a native of Persia, the suit is 'referred ' for the consideration of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Shah. Such references and considerations do not involve a judicial determination, but are rather provocative of indefinite discussion. -f. SSj gH There is virtually, therefore, no Tribunal or forum where suits of the description in question are decided. The above system is admittedly not one established by Treaty, but has grown up so as to claim to be termed ' usage,' under the peculiar circumstances of the country. Mr. Thomson observes, 'It remains for Her Majesty's Government to decide whether the terms of the Treaty or the practice which has been so long established is to form the basis of the Order in Council.' On this it occurs to me to observe that the reason why the terms of the Treaty referred to have not been applied is, tliai neither the material for forming Tribunals, nor, indeed, the common idea of judicial authority nor principles of justice exist in Persia. Hence, Treaties have been abandoned, and an unsatisfactory, imperfect, and temporary practice has been substituted, which is called ' usage.' This so-called usage, however, is so difficult to reconcile with reason or connect with principle that when one comes to speak seriously of basing an Order in ( ouucil thereon one is seriously embarrassed. Nevertheless, it would seem that, before an Order in Council can well be framed for the institution of Consular Courts, it will be desirable to define the limits of their jurisdiction, and with this view to understand whether the usages, as above described, are to be accepted as governing or inciicating the practice of Consular Courts in Persia. Thus it must be decided whether Consular Courts are to be instituted as Tribunals with entire jurisdiction over all suits which are now submitted by ' reference and ior 'discussion ' before the British Consulates and Her Majesty's Minister at 'Tehran. No provision of an Order in Council, 1 may remark, can assume to create or to ailect juris diction which does not already belong to the British authorities. And there is a great difference between the Persian Grovernment submitting a case to discussion or the consi deration of a diplomatic officer and their committing it unreservedly to the positive juris diction of a formal foreign Tribunal. Again, those cases described as being referred to the Persian Minister, i.^., cases where Persian subjects are defendants, would, according to the principles found in the ' usage ' as described, belong to Persian tribunals if they existed or could be recognized.35 But as, virtually, such do not exist, is it part of the present sclieme to continue the reference of this class of cases to the Persian Minister ? . . , To escape from this latter supposition Sir A. Kemball and 1 had in vie^ the possible constitution in Persia of Mixed Commercial Tribunals ( ■ 1 idjarets in F ersia), m hich should take the place of the irregular treatment by the Persian Minister. (I ide paragraphs 38 to 42 of our Report.) And it is in this way that the question of Local Native Courts lor Persia have come under notice in considering the propositions oi an Order in Council foi T ersia. For it is evident that, in providing for a system in jurisdiction, it is requisite that I ribu- nals should be instituted for all, and not only half the litigation, anil that we should kno\v whether competent Tribunals are contemplated for suits where a Persian is defendant and a foreigner is plaintiff. But there is still another and more important consideration. It seems to me that if the institution of such local Courts is found possible, jurisdiction would, if not immediately, yet eventually and naturally, extend beyond the class ot cases which hitherto have been referred to the Persian Authorities, viz., when a Persian is defendant. It would be hard to maintain that jurisdiction should not oe extended to them in all commercial and civil cases in which a Persian subject is a party, whether plaintiff or defendant. If this were not so, and it a strict analogy with the 'usage, ^as detailed in Mr. Thomson's despatch, were maintained, then the future^ Lritish Consuiai Courts would be endowed with jurisdiction in those cases where British subjects are defendants and Persians plaintiffs, and the future Persian Commercial liibunaU ^ould embrace that class of cases where Persians are defendants and British subjects phiintitis. This would be very anomalous, and produce the inconvenient practice which, having prevailed in Egypt, has led to so much evil consequence in that country. If satisfactory Mixed Tribunals could be instituted, which T am now inclined to uai will prove a work of almost insuperable difficulty, the system of Consular Courts in Peisia could be assimilated with that in Turkey, and the Consular jurisdiction would be limited, so that in all cases in which a native or a foreigner, whether plaintiff or defendant, aie in litigation, the native and not the Consular Tribunal would have jurisdiction. But it satis factory Mixed Tribunals cannot be instituted (and even in Turkey they are the reverse ot satisfactorv; and Persia, I understand, is in a less favourable condition for administration of justice 'than is Turkey) it has to be decided what is to become of those cases where Persian subjects are defendants. Probably Mr. Reilly would wish to be instructed on this point before he commences his Draft Order in Council, though it is possible he may find it feasible to prepare an Order without the question of jurisdiction being finally decided. This I venture to suggest, because the same Order in Council has been in use both in Lgypt and in I in ^ey, though the jurisdictions were different in the two countries, lor usage' had been (as already observed) so established in Egypt that in all cases where the British subject was defendant and an Egyptian subject was plaintiff the jurisdiction was that oi the iinlish Consular Court, whilst when the British and Egyptian subjects changed places as piamtiii and defendant the suit was heard before the British Consid or Court. Notwithstanding that in Turkey this was not the practice, but that both classes ot ca^es were exehuet from Consular Courts, yet the same Order in Council was found applicable. I will now advert to another point in Mr. Thomson's despatch as regards t he laws to be applied in Persian Consular Courts. j i a- \ t ? i n I perceive that Mr. Thomson approves of the suggestion made by &gt; ir A. l\em kii and myself that the Consular Tribunals on the Persian littoral and islands should employ the British-Indian Codes. In this I concur with him. But he would prefer Uat the lan a to be applied throughout the rest of the Shah's dominions should be nie laws ot Eng aiu , and here I differ from him:— . . , , i • (1.) Litigation in the interior of Persia, in which British subjects aie inteiested, is very trifling as compared with that on the littoral, and it is not worth while providing a separate system for the smaller number of cases. . (2.) I think it objectionable to have two systems of law operating in one conn O. (3.) I think the Indian system better in many respects ior a country undei ic conditions in which Persia now exists. , i , j i • (4.) Though the English law is one to which 1 am most habituated, and m some sort attached and possibly prejudiced, yet I cannot forbear to urge that it is, 11011 '^ 111 its commercial, civil, or criminal character, a system which should be introduced into a foreign country, or perpetuated in its present shape anywhere I also regret that Mr. Thomson looks unfavourably upon the proposal made by bir A. Kemball and myse to have a Court of Appeal at Bushire, because I attach very great importance to that proposal.Mr. r l homson objects that the Persian Government would not eonsent to causes heard in the Capital heing referred in appeal to a provincial Court. T think in this there must be some misunderstanding, for the Persian Government would have nothing to say on tins subject, unless, indeed, Persian subjects appeared in these causes as plaintiffs or defendants, and this^ would only occur on the assumption (which I do not yet make) that Consular Couits of TVst Instance will be seized of cases in which Persians were plaintiffs. Jl. howevei, it is held that the objections of Mr. Thomson are sound, a Court of Appeal might be instituted at Bushire for all districts except Teheran. Noi Mas it suggested that there should be a Court of Appeal at Bushire from Persian mixed commcicial tribunals, but from Consular Courts. The Order in Council will not have to deal with the constitution or working of local mixed Courts, a subject which has been introduced into this discussion only collaterally, and it can make no diffiiencc to the 1 ersian Government where a dispute between two foreigners shall be ' a 'V ' ce ^ ^ T1 a PP ea l -whether at Bushire, Teheran, or Bombay, At any rate a Court ox I nst Appeal at Bushire from Consular Tribunals in the littoral would be, I submit unobjectionable. ' A capable .Indicia! Appeal Court at Bushire would give unity to the proceedings iu the Courts below, and would operate as a check as well as a guide to Consular Courts of the littoral in their earlier development. On the ultimate appeal to Bombay it would seem there is unanimity. . . I c ^ s i re ^ 0 revert for one moment to the general consideration of extra-territorial juiibdiction in Persia.^ If we assert throughout Persia privileges in regard to the administration of justice and legal procedure for British subjects which we think, and no doubt rightly think, would be beneficiaJ both for Persia and Her Majesty's subjects, yet there is an attendant evil in so doing which results from the favoured-nation principle. Am pih ilcge ^hich we claim or exercise will be claimed by other Governments, and the privileges which may fairly be used by us may be abused by others. This was the case in Lgypt. T happened to know that natives of that country and the Egyptian (xovernment would have been content to continue the ' extraordinary usages' in juiisdiction if tnc} had been confined to the English Courts. But w r here seventeen other Nationalities claimed, and many of them abused these privileges, the system became intolerable, aiid to escape from it much trouble has been and is experienced. it is desirable therefore to reflect how far temporary advantages derived from an institution of Tribunals based upon large extra-territorial pretensions will be a real )eiu 11 ai - &lt;l a lasting character in a country like Persia, surrounded as she is by a st f .ong (ion eininent, ready to take advantage of any instrument to diminish the authority 0i the Government, and discredit her independent and internal power. . , ^ indeed, on reflection, seen some reason to doubt the conclusion I came to witi Sii A. Kemball, § 10 of our Report. We there say—'The establishment of one and the same Orders in Council throughout territories subject to the sovereignty of the Shah would we think, be indispensable.I should now, I think, hesitate to 'affirm this, and J should rather submit with deference whether the applicability of the Order in Council should not be to the &lt;£ Persian littoral ' only. I think that if the littoral of the Persian Gulf only at first should be brought under the influence of a judicial system based upon the usage, there w T ould be less chance of provoking discussion and diplomatic disputes upon the judicial rights in question, or of raising the suspicions of the Persian Government. The Report of the Government of India ( § 18 of Report), ' to keep the arrangements regarding the Persian Government ^inte distinct from those in the interior of Persia,' is one which I am inclined now to tmnk is the sounder view. T am not, however, prepared to agree that it would be desirable by one Order in Council 'to establish a jurisdiction for the whole water and li tuia of the Persian and Oman Gulfs.' It seems to me, ; then, that by excluding the Capital and ( ie interior of Persia from the operation of the proposed Order in Council vu 1 might escape from grave questions with the Shah's Government, for probably usage might be assumed as the basis for the littoral, without provoking discussion or raising the question of the institution of new Civil Tribunals. We should also be providing oi \\ iat aie the real wants of British subjects and interests. The experiment would be net whcTe it could have the best chance of success, and the conditions are most avourable. Moreover, if found successful, it might be developed, supposing the necessity was nereatter. ,, ^'ppointment o r a legal officer at Teheran, as proposed by Mr. Thomson, was we,. (onsiderc'l jy us, and we concluded that it was not advisable. But if the amount of37 commercial ousiness or the development of railways should produce consequences hereafter, such as to require a judicial staff at Tehran, Her Majesty's Government will be able to deal with the circumstances when they arise.

I RECEIVED Mr. Lister's letter of 22nd August, 1874 (which I should have sooner answered, but that I was absent from England when it arrived, and for some time after wards) transmitting to me papers on the subject of British jurisdiction in Persia (all which are returned herewith), and requesting for your Lordship any observations I might [87] * Nos. 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14. t Lhave to offer thereupon, before preparing the Draft of an Order in Council on the subject; and I have accordingly prepared a Memorandum, which I inclose, and which I submit to your Lordship. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) FRANS. S. RE ILLY. Inclosure in No. 18. Memorandum on British Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction in Persia and in the Arab States on or near the Persian Gulf. SIR H. RAAVLTNSON, in his remarks on the Report of Sir P. Francis and Sir A. KembaJl of 4th September, 1873 (which, for brevity, I shall call the Joint Report), says 'I should strongly recommend that, before any Order in Council were passed, applying the Foreign jurisdiction Act to Persia, an attempt should be made to conclude a Convention or Capitulation with the Shah's Government, defining our rights both as to Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction.'' 2. In this recommendation, after a consideration of the papers, I concur. 3. At present, it appears British extra-territorial jurisdiction in Persia rests on the following stipulation in Article IX of the Treaty of Peace between the Queen and the Shah, signed at Paris, 4th March, 1857 :— ' The Pligh Contracting Parties engage that the treatment of their respective subjects, and their trade, shall also, in every respect, be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of the most favoured nation.' 4. There are, indeed, some passages in the Joint Report, and in Sir A. Kemball's reply to Sir H. Rawlinson's remarks, suggesting, as I understand them, that to a great extent, if not wholly, and at least in the opinion of the Government of India, British jurisdiction in Persia is grounded on usage, sufferance, and prescription. 1 have not seen the despatch of the Government of India referred to; but I think, after a war, terminated by a Treaty containing a specific stipulation on the subject, it might be difficult to sustain this view, at least so as to draw therefrom any inference respecting the character or extent of the jurisdiction. For the present purpose, at any rate, the Treaty may be taken as the foundation of the jurisdiction, or at least as supplying the only, or the best available, test of its nature and scope. For the future, if there is to be a new Convention, the question, on what the jurisdiction has heretofore rested, will be of no moment. 5. It appears that in 1857, and until lately, the most favoured nation in Persia, in respect of this kind of jurisdiction, was Russia, 6. The effect of the Treaty of Commerce between Russia and Persia, signed at Turcomanchai, February, 1828 (45 State Papers, 865) Articles VII and VIII, is as follows:— (a.) Civil suits between Russians are to be submitted exclusively to the examination and decision of the Russian Mission or Consul, according to the laws and customs of the Empire of Russia. (b.) The like is to apply as to questions arising between Russians and other foreigners, in case the parties agree thereto. (c.) Civil questions between Russians and Persians are to be carried before the Hakim or Governor, and are not to be examined and decided otherwise than in the presence of a Dragoman of the Russian Mission or Consulate. (of.) The last-mentioned cases are not to be re-opened after being once decided, except on notice to the Russian Minister or Consul, and then are to be disposed of in the Supreme Chancel! erie of the Shah at Tabriz, or at Tehran, in the presence of a Dragoman of the Russian Mission or Consulate. (e.) In case of murder or other crime committed as between Russians, the examina tion and the decision of the case are to belong exclusively to the Russian Minister or Consul. (/.) If a Russian is involved with other foreigners in a criminal proceeding, or is charged with direct culpability, the Persian Tribunals are not to proceed to examination and judgment except in presence of a delegate of the Russian Mission or Consulate ; and if there is none such on the spot, the local authorities are to cause the delinquent to be brohght to a place where there is a Russian Consul or Agent; the evidence on both sides39 being' collecced hy Hie Hakim and the Judge of the place, and signed by them, and transmitted in this form to the place of trial. (#.) When the accused is duly convicted, and the sentence is pronounced, he is to be delivered to the Russian Minister or Consul, who is to send him to Russia, there to undergo the punishment imposed by the laws. 7. By force of the most-favoured-nation clause, these provisions have been regarded as applicable to the British Diplomatic and Consular authorities and British subjects from 1857 to the present time. 8. It seems, however, from Mr. Thomson's despatch of 31st December, 1873 (which shows that Mr. Abbott was correct in his statements, cited in the Joint Report, ^ 3), that usage has in one important respect superseded the Treaty. As regards civil cases between Persians, on the one hand, and British (as other foreign) subjects, on the other hand, the course adopted has, for many years past, been this, as I read Mr. Thomson's despatch : — (a.) In the capital these cases are referred for.investigation and decision, where the British subject is defendant, to the British Legation; and, where the British subject is plaintiff, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (b.) In the provinces, the reference is to the Consul or to the Foreign Minister's representative there, as the case requires ; and if a satisfactory settlement is not obtained by this means a reference is made (and this is of very frequent occurrence) from the pi ounces to the Capital, where the matter is discussed between the Legation and the Persian Grovernment. (c.) If the British Minister and the Persian Government cannot agree, the British Minister lays the case before his own Government. 9. On this state of things Mr. Thomson observes:— [t remains with Her Majesty's Government to decide whether the terms of the r I reaty, or the practice which has for so long a time been established, is to form the basis of the Order in Council.' 10. In this conclusion of Mr. Thomson's I agree, provided the Order is to be framed on the footing of the existing state of things, without a new Convention. 11. The question whether the Treaty or the usage should be followed would neces sarily involve some difficulty for Her Majesty's,Government. \'2. It it was decided that the usage should form the basis of the Order, it would have to be borne in mind that under the usage the resort is to diplomatic, not to judicial, procedure, [t would therefore be open to the Persian Government at any time to embarrass Her Majesty's Government by denying the validity, under the usage, of an Order in Council referring questions to British judges instead of to British diplomatists, as the usage required; especially as Her Majesty's Government would doubtless object to the corresponding change on the Persian side being made. 1-i. It is also suggested in the Joint Report (§ 4) as a question, whether in fact, and in disregard of the Russian Treaty, a criminal case with a British accused, and Persian complainant, would not be left for trial to the British authorities. If there was no new Convention, it would be necessary for Her Majesty's Government, before an Order in Council was made, to ascertain how T the practice is on this important point, and if the practice was found to differ from the Treaty, to decide on which they w 7 ould act in framing the Order. This, again, would be a question not easy to determine, causing discussion and delay. 14. But the embarrassments inevitably arising, where there is neither a clear instru ment nor clear usage, do not end here. ! ». It is a question whether Russia is any longer to be regarded as the most favoured nation. 1G. A Treaty ot Commerce was signed between the German Empire and Persia at St. Petersburgh on 11th June, 1873. 1 i. Article XIII of that Treaty provides to this effect: — ^ (a.) ( ivil suits between Germans are to be examined and judged by the German Representatives or Consuls, according to German law, without the local authority beinf allowed to oppose the smallest obstacle or difficulty. (b.) Civil questions between Germans and other foreigners are to be judged exclusively by their Agents or Consuls. (c.) C ivil questions between Germans and Persians are to be tried before the Persian Tribunals ; but they are not to be decided or judged except in the presence and with the intervention of the German Representative or Consul, or his Dragoman, the whole (or wholly) according to the laws and customs of the country (that is, of Persia). (d.) The last-mentioned cases are not to be re-opened, except with the knowledge of the German Representative or Consul, or in his name, in the presence of a Dragoman,and then only before one of the Supreme Courts (' Cours Supremes de Controle et do Cassation '), which sit at Tehran, Tauris, or Ispahan. 18. x \rticle XIA' of the same Treaty relates to proceedings in case of the insolvency of a German in Persia, and provides that those proceedings shall not be taken except with the knowledge and by the intervention of the German Representative or Consul. 19. Article XV makes provisions respecting the property of a German dying in Persia, which, if he has no relatives or partners, is. to be delivered to the German Agent or Consul, to be disposed of according to German law. 20. Article XYI provides for criminal cases, in which Germans are involved, in Persia, being decided according to the mode adopted in Persia with respect to the most favoured nation. 21. This German Treaty thus varies from the Russian Treaty in some particulars of importance ; among others these :— (a.) In civil suits between Germans and other foreigners, the jurisdiction of the territorial sovereign is expressely excluded, while this is not so in the Russian Treaty. (&amp;.) Civil suits between Germans and Persians (apparently whichever be the nationality of the defendant) are to be determined not only in Persian Tribunals, but also according to the laws and customs of Persia; this not being so expressed in the Russian Treaty, and being, with respect to some classes of cases, at variance with the ordinary rules of private international law. (c.) In the last-mentioned cases any revision of a decision is to be made by one of three Supreme Courts named, instead of it being, as in the Russian Treaty, referred to the Supreme Chancellerie of the Shah. (d.) The provisions of the German Treaty respecting insolvency and succession to property on death are wanting in the Russian Treaty. 22. In respect of the first and last of these variations, the terms of the German Treaty are more favourable to foreigners than those of the Russian Treaty. In respect of the second, the German Treaty (if I have rightly understood it) is on the surface less favourable to foreigners, but the stipulation, perhaps, has some covert object. It cannot, on the one hand, I suppose, have been inserted by inadvertence ; nor, on the other, can it have been intended by the Germans to be taken seriously and to be acted on. In respect of the third variation, the German Treaty may or may not be more favourable to foreigners than the Russian Treaty is; this would depend mainly on the Supreme Courts referred to being duly established (I am told they are non-existent) and fairly worked. 23. The mere fact of serious divergences between two Treaties, by reference to one or both of which Treaties the Queen's rights are to be ascertained, might at any time cause embarrassment to Her Majesty's Government. If another Power (suppose France) were to obtain more favourable terms, a further element oi confusion would be introduced. 24. It seems, moreover, anomalous that the interests of British subjects should be left in this state of uncertainty; the law applicable to them being, furthermore, liable to change from time to time (even though it be a change for the better) by the effect of transactions, in which Her Majesty's Government have no voice. 25. Again, if British Courts were organized in Persia, a question might be raised in a Court there, or on appeal, whether the usage, which (as Mr, Thomson states) has, as between Persia and foreigners, partially superseded the Russian Treaty, is not, in its turn, set aside by the German Treaty, which is framed on the original lines of the Russian Treaty, without regard to the substituted usage. Proceedings in a British Court between a Persian plaintiff and a British defendant might, on this ground, be decided to have been taken coram non judice, and to be a nullity. 26. Then, as regards criminal cases, there is one provision expressed in the Russian Treaty, and imported by reference into the German Treaty, which is wholly inapplicable in the case of British subjects. It is stipulated that, where a Russian offender is convicted in a Persian Court, he is to be delivered to the Russian Minister or Consul, who is to send him to Russia, there to undergo the punishment imposed by the laws. ^ To- say nothing, as regards British subjects, ot distance and expense and other considerations, such a stipulation is, in point of English law, nugatory, not merely in this country, but also everywhere beyond the territorial limits of Persia, Nothing less than an express and direct Act of Parliament (and no such Act would ever be passed) could give effect to it. (This is not a case to which section 5 oi the Poreign Jurisdiction Act ot 1843 would apply.) 27. Lastly, even if the instruments umler which Her Majesty now holds Her extra-territorial jurisdiction in Persia, or by 'Vviiich at least that jurisdiction is limited and regulated, did not give rise to any difficulties such as these, yet the precariousness of the41 tenure of the jurisdiction under those instruments would be strange. From 1857 to 1873, Her Majesty's jurisdiction seems to have depended, if not in the strictest sense for its existence, yet at least for the ascertainment of its extent and the mode of its exercise, on the continuance of the Russian Treaty. But that Treaty might at any moment have been put an end to, as between Eussia and Persia, by war, or by agreement, or otherwise. 'The effect on Her Majesty's jurisdiction of the cesser of that Treaty would not have been determined, perhaps, without some difficulty, nor possibly without considerable litigation among individual British subjects. The existence of the German Treaty diminishes the gravity of this kind of danger, but does not put an end to it. 28. These considerations (among otheTs) lead me to concur in Sir H. Rawlinson's recommendation. Before any Order in Council is made, I submit that there should be obtained a separate and clear grant of extra-territorial jurisdiction to the Qi,ieen by the 29. Sir A. Kemball, indeed, in his reply to Sir H. Rawlinson's remarks, suggests that the proposal to Persia of a special Convention would not be without risk. 'If unreservedly made (he says) it might involve, in its rejection, the abrogation of privileges not hitherto disputed.' But this result does not seem to me possible. The jurisdiction cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn by Persia. !N\)r is it explained why Persia should wish, or how she should be able, to refuse to this country a separate Convention, when she has lately granted one to Germany. 30. A different and almost opposite danger is indicated by Sir P. Francis in his despatch (April 30, 1874), commenting on Mr. Thomson's despatch. Sir P, Francis suggests that other Governments will be entitled to claim whatever advantages Persia grants to the Queen, 'and the privileges (he says) which may be fairly used by us may be abused by others. This was the case in Egypt.' This consideration is one of general policy for Her Majesty's Government, and it is sufficient for me to note it here. 31. The terms of any Convention to be proposed to Persia would, no doubt, receive the careful consideration of Her Majesty's Government. The observations I have made tend to show that, in some respects, it would not be expedient for Her Majesty's Govern ment merely to copy the stipulations in the Russian Treaty or in the German Treaty. There are other points to which I would suggest that attention should be given:— (1.) An effort should be made to retain and legalise the system substituted by usage for the stipulations of the Russian Treaty, but not embodied in the German Treaty, in respect of suits between Persian plaintiffs and British defendants. That usage is in con formity with the principle of private international law, actor sequitur forum rei. A Persian suing a British subject would have to come to the British Court. This is so by Treaty in Morocco. There must, no doubt, have been some peculiar reason why the German Treaty .did not keep up the usage. (2.) The Convention should be so framed as to allow, further, of even a Persian defendant voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the British Court, on his obtaining the consent of the competent Persian authority, in accordance with the practice in the British Courts in the Levant (now regulated by Article 81 of the Ottoman Order in Council). (3.) It would, 1 think/be desirable to establish in Persia, and for this the concur rence of Persia, and consequently a Convention, would be requisite, a Court of Appeal of mixed (Persian and British) nationality, for all civil suits between British and Persian subjects. Indeed, if the two foregoing suggestions are embodied in a Convention, the establishment of a Mixed Court of Appeal would almost necessarily follow as part of the Convention. A tribunal of this kind has been recommended for Morocco by the Law Officers (on which point, with others, I refer to my Memorandum on British Extra territorial Jurisdiction in Morocco, 3rd August, 1874). (4.) The authors of the Joint Report (§ 37), and Sir H, Rawlinson and Mr. Thomson, are all strongly in favour of Mixed Tribunals (meaning tribunals of first instance) being established, after proper preparations and arrangements, for adjudication of that class of mixed suits in which there are British plaintiffs and Persian defendants. This arrangement could be effected by the same Convention. (The suggestion of the Joint Report adds to the case of Persian defendants that of non-British foreigners, defendants ; but this is a matter in which Persia is not concerned, and in which no further Convention with her would be needed, as by the German Treaty she waives juris diction over all foreigners, as among themselves.) (5.) The terms of the Convention should be large enough to give validity, as between this country and Persia, to any arrangement whatever that Her Majesty's Government and the Government of India from time to time determine to adopt, whether with respect to judicial organization, or with respect to territorial division, or [87] ^ iU42 Tvith respect to the application of any given system of law. For instance, the stipula tions should not be limited by any such expression as that in Article VII of the Russian lieat), to tae om'd (hat civil suits between Russians are to be decided according' to the laws and customs of the Empire of Russia. 32, T gather from the Joint Report (§§ 8, 9, 10), that the Government of India have proposed that a single jurisdiction should be established for the whole waters and littoral ot the Persian and Oman Gulfs, separately from the interior of Persia. :3'3. rhe authors ol the Joint Report, on the contrary, advocate the establishment of one and the same Order in Council, meaning, no doubt, one uniform system of judicature, throughout territories, subject to the sovereignty of the Shah; and Sir H. Rawlinson states that he quite concurs in this. 1 . ''' ^ \ Francis (April .^0, 1S&lt;4), intimates, in the following passage, a change of his views on this point, since he was a party to the Joint Report:— • ! think the littoral of the Persian Gulf only, or at first, should be brought under the influence of a judicial system, based upon usage. There would be less 'chance of provoking discussion and diplomatic disputes upon the judicial rights in question, or % of raising the suspicions of the Persian Government. ... By excluding the capital and the intciior ot Persia from the operation ol the proposed Order in Council, we mi^ht escape from grave questions with the Shah's Government.' o5. i do not venture to form an opinion on this subject. But 1 must observe that it would be scarcely practicable to carve out a portion of the territory of Persia, sever it from the other portion by an imaginary line, and organize in it a system of British judicature, leaving the rest of the Persian territory in its present condition, that is, in otfcct, imp:ovided ior. It appears to me that it will be necessary to comprise in one Order in Council, or in several Orders in Council, the whole of Persia, on some combined and harmonious systems, if not on one single system.• oG, 1^ gather also from the Joint Report that the Government of India proposed that the law to be administered in the Courts on the Persian littoral should be British Indian law, including the Indian Penal Code. The authors of the Joint Report go further; following up their recommendation of one system for the whole of Persia, thev say (§11);— 'If one system of jurisdiction must be adopted for all Persia, it may be worthy of consideration whether Indian law and Indian appellate jurisdiction should^ not rather be extended to the interior of Persia, than that the Persian littoral should be subjected to English law.' 37. On this subject Sir H. Rawlinson asks :— ' Is the Crown competent to make British subjects amenable to the Indian Penal Code in an independent country like Persia ?' 38. 1 am ot opinion (concurring with »3ir A. Kemball's argument in his reply), that it is competent for the Queen in Council, legislating under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, to extend to British subjects in Persia that modification of English law known as British Indian law. 39. And it seems to me, on the whole, that the simplest and most judicious course would be to apply British Indian law to the whole of Persia. 40. In the Joint Report (§§ 12, 13), a question is next raised respecting the right of the Queen to nominate Consuls in Persia. It is there suggested that this right rests on Article IX of the Treaty of 1857, putting Her Majesty's Government on the footing of that of the most favoured nation 'in the establishment and recognition of Consulswhile under Article X of the Treaty of Peace between Russia and Persia, signed at Turcomanchai, February 1828 (15 State Papers, G69), Russia has the right to appoint Consuls or Commercial Agents everywhere where the interests of commerce shall require it. On this Sir H. Rawlinson says;— Ihe phrase is i in the establishment and recognition of Consuls/ that is, in respect to their authority and privileges, not in respect to the number to be appointed.' 41. 1 cannot quite concur in this narrow construction, but I think it is doubtful (as suggested in the India Office letter of 7th August, 1873) whether this Russian Treaty confers on Russia an absolute right to appoint any number of Consuls in Persia, and to station them where she pleases. It would seem that there is implied a reservation to Persia of a voice in the question, what are the places where the interests of commerce require the presence of Russian Consuls. 42. As far, however, as regards jurisdiction, the question of the construction of this Russian Treaty may be avoided if a new Convention is obtained. The Convention should be so worded as to enable Her Majesty to delegate her jurisdiction to any Representative whom she might think fit to appoint for that purpose, without his being43 in tlie Consular (or Diplomatic) Service. This is so under the Treaties with China and with Japan, while in Turkey the use of the term Consul in the Capitulations has given rise to various difficulties in the organization of the British Courts in the Levant, for instance, with reference to the capacity of Consular officers not holding commissions from the Queen. The matter must be one of indifference to Persia. There is no magic in the title Consul. 43. The next question discussed in the Joint Report (§§ 17-21) is, whether an appeal should be given from the proposed British Courts in Persia to the High Court of Bombay, or an arrangement for local appeal should be made by the appointment of a Judge. Sir H. Rawlinson agrees with the Joint Report in preferring the latter. He makes these remarks :— 'I doubt whether Persia would concede a right of jurisdiction (by special Convention) to our Consuls, if such jurisdiction were saddled with a right of appeal to a foreign Court at Constantinople or Bombay. Nor would it be fair to Persian suitors prosecuting British subjects before a Consular Court in Persia that the defendant, if cast, should have the power of re-opening the suit in Turkey or in India. By far the best arrangement would be to have a special Judge of Appeal for Persia and the Gulf (as in paragraph 21) located in Bushire, but going once a year on circuit to Tehran, Resht, and Tabreez, to hear appeals.' 44. On this question I would observe : (i.) As regards appeals in cases purely between British subjects, Persia must (as Sir A. Kemball has pointed out in his reply) be indifferent, inasmuch as she waives jurisdiction in those cases, both in first instance and in appeal. (ii.) Where there are a Persian plaintiff and a British defendant, I agree with Sir H. Rawlinson in thinking that there should be no appeal to Constantinople or to Bombay. The Mixed Court of Appeal suggested would take these cases. (iii.) The special Judge of Appeal for Persia, proposed in the Joint Report, and approved by Sir H. Rawlinson, seems intended to take appeals in all classes of suits, whether mixed or purely British. But for mixed suits a Mixed Court of Appeal, and not a special British Judge of Appeal, would be best. As regards purely British suits, there would, 1 apprehend, be very great advantage in having an Appellate Court on the spot. Appeals would be easily brought, and the control over the inferior Courts would be effective. The main difficulty, I suppose, would be in the expense. It is possible, however, that this might be got over by the appointment of a Judge belonging to the Indian Civil Service, or by some arrangement for the delegation periodically, from the High Court of Bombay, of a Judge or high officer of that Court, to visit Persia. Whatever plan, however, were adopted for a local Tribunal of Appeal, I think its decisions could scarcely be made absolutely final. In cases of magnitude or difficulty, a further appeal would probably have to be allowed, and these appeals should, I think, go to Bombay. 45. On the part of the Joint Report (§§ 26-36) relating to the Arab States, enumerated in 26, I would observe :— (i.) There would seem, as far as I can judge from the Joint Report, to be a suffi cient basis for an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, in usage and sufferance, as regards these States. (ii.) The best course would, in my opinion, be to apply, as far as local circumstances will admit, the same system of judicature and appeal to the Arab States as to Persia. (iii.) The Orders in Council for Zanzibar and Muscat, referred to in the Joint Report, are generally similar in form and substance to the Order for Morocco, which I had lately occasion to examine (Memorandum 3rd August 1874). I could not recommend the extension of those Orders to any other territory, pr the adoption of them as pre cedents. In my judgment, the Ottoman Order, in its latest form, should be the model for future Orders. (iv.) The Joint Report discusses a revision of the Muscat Order, and adverts incidentally to a revision of the Zanzibar Order; but I refrain from going into these questions ; I am not clear that they are referred to me. (v.) The Joint Report suggests that the scope of British jurisdiction might be extended, as in the Order for China, to British vessels or [? and] the vessels of Arab States at sea within the limits of the Persian Gulf. The China Order is in this respect founded on a special Act of Parliament, 6 &amp; 7 Vict., cap. 80. It applies to British subjects only. To give effect to this suggestion, as regards British vessels or subjects, an Act of Parliament would be necessary ; and as regards Arab vessels. Conventions would also be necessary. (vi.) The Joint Report adverts to deportation. The provisions of existing Orders in [87] ^ NCouncil respecting deportation have been lately considered by me (Memorandum, 6tb of June/1874, on Deportation), an d caution will be requisite in dealing with the subject for the future. 40. The following is a summary of the chief recommendations whicli I beg leave to submit to Lord Derby on the whole subject:— (1.) That a uniform system, or combined systems, of judicature for the whole of Persia should be established by Order in Council, with adaptations to the different circumstances of the interior and the littoral: (2.) That the officers exercising the jurisdiction should not necessarily be Consuls : (3.) That in purely British suits there should be an appeal in Persia : (4.) That in purely British suits there should be a final appeal (in proper cases) to the High Court of Bombay : ■ (5.) That in mixed suits, with Persian plaintiffs and British defendants, the British Courts should have exclusive jurisdiction in the first instance; (6.) That in mixed suits, with British plaintiffs and Persian defendants, mixed Courts should have jurisdiction in the first instance, but with liberty for a Persian defendant to submit to the British Court: (7.) That for both these classes of mixed suits there should be a Mixed Court of Appeal in Persia: (8.) That British-Indian law, civil and criminal, should be applied throughout: (9.) That any Order in Council should, as regards Persia, be based on a separate and express Convention: (10.) That like provisions, with proper variations, should be applied to the Arab States by Order in Council, on the basis of usage and sufferance. (Signed) mAm. S. REILLY. Westminster, November 4, 1874.■' ■ - •••« that ce the Kussians, as the most-favoured nation, have no general power of entertaining civil suits in which Russian subjects are defendants,' they, the Russians, appear nevertheless to exercise such a power. On this point Mr. Abbott, giving the result of his experience at Tabreez, says that ' in civil cases the Persian Government would never think of interfering in a suit in which the defendant were a British subject—they would look to the Consul for redress.' The inference is therefore against the Russians foregoing an undisputed privilege, though, as Mr. Abbott's account of the practice of the Russian Consulate General at Tabreez is very imperfect, the fact ought perhaps to be certified by further inquiry. 4. As regards criminal jurisdiction in Persia, based on sufferance and usage, though £ *' not so clearly defined,' , the assumption is that at Bushire the trial as well as the punishment of the offender, being a British, subject or 'protege/' and the prosecutor being a Persian subject, would be left to the British authorities. At Tabreez also a case is incidentally reported by Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran which justifies the same view of British jurisdiction. Her Majesty's Consul-General there having proceeded to try certain Greeks (British ' prot^g^s'') on the charge of maltreating a Persian subject, inflicted a fine upon the offenders. The Persian authorities, without objecting to the course taken by him, protested only against the inadequacy of the penalty. On the other hand, Mr. Abbott, in reporting on the proposed establishment of British jurisdiction in Persia, remarks that ' in criminal cases occurring between English and Persian subjects, the English might be condemned by a Persian tribunal, but his punishment would not rest with the native authorities, who would have to make him over to the Consul to be sent to the British dominions to meet his deserts.' He leaves it to be inferred thereby that jurisdiction in such cases, to the extent at least of trial, rests of right and in practice with the Persian authorities. 5. The value of the privileges thus assumed cannot be overrated, and (viewing the character of Persian administration of law, the nature of Mahommedan jurisprudence, and the state of prisons in Persia) if prescriptively established, ought no doubt to be maintained un diminished. In the matter of the disposal and punishment of the convict in Persia, our rights would in most respects be the same as those we enjoy in Turkey, and, as being equally claimed by Russia, could not we presume be disputed. But in respect of recourse to a British Consular tribunal for the trial and judgment of an offender being a British subject, we apprehend that the exercise of this larger privilege, though by usage hitherto conceded to us in Egypt, may depend (more especially in complicated cases where more than one foreigner, other than Persian, should be concerned) on common consent, and may be indefensible in Persia against Treaty stipulations or the practice of the most favoured nation. Inconvenience might result from assuming authoritatively more extended powers than are arrogated not only by Russia, but by the other European nations having Treaties with Persia. 6. In respect then to criminal as well as to civil jurisdiction, the Turkish Order in Council appears to us to be well suited to the circumstances of Persia. We believe at least that there is nothing in the provisions of the Turkish Order to debar us either from using existing privileges in Persia, or from participating under ' the most favoured-nation ' clause in any privileges that may hereafter be conceded to other Powers in that country. 7. The only matters which would appear to affect our recom mendation of the Turkish Order relate Istly to the proposed exercise of jurisdiction on separate conditions in different parts of Persia, and 2ndly, to the propriety or otherwise of conferring Consular Com missions on Her Majesty's Representatives in the Persian Gulf. These matters form subjects of discussion in the correspondence and documents before us. [87] F Letter to Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, dated August 18,1862, No. 39.

Under that system extension of Indian law to interioi* of Persia worthy of considera tion. Right of Her Majesty to nominate Consuls in Persia. Memorandum forwarded from Teheran to Foreign Office, dated 1863. 8. The first consists in the proposal of the Indian authorities u to establish a single jurisdiction for the whole water and littoral of the 1 ersian aiul Oman Criilfs, and ''to keep the arrangements regarding the Persian shores quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia.' It is argued that, as in the territories mentioned the status of the Consular body, and the determination of the course of appeal and of the law to be administered are common to the exercise of jurisdiction, such jurisdiction being actually exercised by one and the same officer, accredited from India to all those territories. '• Unity ol authority, whether local or controlling, and residing in one and the same Department, is the most pressing desideratum in all these regions;' that ' the general executive control should be with the Government of Indiaand again, that u the interior of Persia should be under the Minister at Teheran and the English Foreign Office, and the Persian shores under the Eesident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India.^ 9. A preliminary question to be here decided is, whether, assuming the expediency of making appeal to lie from the Consular Courts located in the north of Persia to Constantinople, and the law to be administered English law, while, on the other hand, it were desired to make appeal to lie from the southern portion of Persia and the Persian littoral to Bombay, and the law to be administered British Indian law, with the Indian Penal Code, such an arrangement would be admissible ? 10. For the rest, however desirable the course suggested by the Government of India, on the grounds that the towns and islands of the Persian littoral are almost exclusively ruled by Arab Chiefs on the patriarchal system, without interference from the Persian Govern ment ; that jurisdiction there has been hitherto exercised on the same footing as in the independent States of the Arabian littoral; and that the circumstances generally of the Persian littoral would justify the exercise of larger powers than would, perhaps, be admissible among communities having more defined foreign relations; yet, to the adoption of such a course an insuperable obstacle, we believe, presents itself in the differing conditions which must influence judicial pro cedure in the several territories concerned. If, on the one hand, 'sufferance and usage' were to govern jurisdiction in the indepen dent Arab States, while, on the other hand, in Persia, Muscat, and Turkish Arabia, respectively, it were governed by varying and some what stringent treaty stipulations, separate provision must probably be made for its exercise in each case. So also in respect of the Persian shores, as distinguished from the interior of Persia. Considering the jealousy which is manifested by Persian officials on all occasions of territorial delimitation, and the exceptions which, on the Persian littoral, must still be made of the ports directly subject to Persian authority, viz., Bushire, Lingah, and perhaps (or on occasion) Bunder Abbas, we apprehend that distinctive arrangements might be inexpe dient. The establishment of one and the same Order in Council throughout territories subject to the sovereignty of the Shah would, we think, be indispensable. 11. If one system of jurisdiction be adopted for all Persia, it may be worthy of consideration whether Indian law and Indian appellate jurisdiction should not rather be extended to the 'interior of Persia,'' than that 'the Persian littoral' should be subjected to English law. 12. The next point to be determined by the proper authorities refers to the right pertaining to Her Majesty to nominate Consuls generally in Persia, or in the special case to issue Circular Com missions to Her Majesty's Political Resident and Assistant Residents in the Persian Gulf. 13. The right is presumed to exist on the following grounds:— ' By the Treaty of Commerce with the Shah of 1841 our right to name Consuls in Persia was limited, but by Article IX of the Treatyof Peace, signed in i ^aris in 1857, we are placed in this matter on the Grounds on which right is assumed to be looting ol the most favoured nation. Our commercial relations with perfect. Persia are therefore based on the Treaty of Peace concluded between Russia and Persia at Turcomanchai in 1828, and by the'Xth Article of that Treaty Russia has the right to appoint Consuls or Consular Agents wherever the interests of commerce may require their presence in the Persian dominions.' 14. Her Majesty's right so based is, we conclude, perfect and unassailable. If it were deemed open to question, there would remain the alternative proposition that the Political Resident and his Assistants in the Persian Gull should be vested, in their proper capacities, with the requisite judicial authority. To this proposition, however, unless the alternative be unavoidable, we are disposed to demur. The Resident and his Assistants are accredited not only to. Objections to the Resident in the Persian the Arab states but to Persia, and are thereby rendered subject to ant l his Assistants being vested the provisions of our Treaties with Persia and subordinate to Her wittl j^ dicial authority in their proper Majesty's Legation at Teheran. In like cases of officers of Her ca P acitles * Majesty's Indian Political service being employed beyond Indian limits, the practice has been to confer on such officers Consular Com missions, to wit, at Baghdad, Bussorah, Muscat and Zanzibar; and these Commissions being honorary only and accessory, and being so declared, need not withdraw the holders in any respect from the authority of Her Majesty's Indian Government. • 15 And as in any case the Political Resident and his assistants The pref e ra ble course to issue to these would oe called upon to exercise notarial and magisterial-functions Officers Consular Commissions, conformably with English law, more notably in respect, to the Merchant Seamen's Acts, we share the opinion of the Government of India that 'it would be safer and less likely to give rise to mis- Despatch to the Duke of Argyll, No. 19, understanding to give to the officers in question the designations of January 24, 1873, paragraph 16. Consul-General and Consul, respectively, in addition to the titles of Resident, or Assistant-Resident, or Political Agent, as the case may be.' 10. In order to relieve the Resident from being continually Letter from Resident, Persian Gulf, to hampered with small causes, particularly at Bushire (our political Goyernment of Bombay, relations around the Guli of Persia and Oman being his proper and sufficient charge, and his absence from head-quarter being frequent and protracted), it becomes a question whether his assistants should not be vested with co-ordinate jurisdiction, or whether appeal should lie, as of couise, from his assistants to himself. The latter condition, - Tj^e Government of India recommends that be it observed, does not obtain (nor could obtain under existing appeals from Gwadur should, as in the Consular arrangements) in other parts of Persia. In Turkey, appeal d r ! l r ^ n ^ U8Cat Con8u,ate ' be to from every grade of Consular Officer is to the Judge at Constanti- a C ^nsXr' Commission ought, we pre- nople only. T rom the Consular Courts at Muscat and Zanzibar sume, to be issued to the Political Agent appeal lies actually to the High Court of Bombay. at Gwadur. 17. As regards the subject of appeal, the arguments in favour of Despatch from Resident in Persian Gulf Indian appellate jurisdiction tor the territories borderini&gt;' the Persian to Government of Bombay, No.473/129, Gulf are, that ' by far the greater number of our subjects in the region T dated 0ctob er 22, 1870. in question are natives of British India, and the interests to be dealt 'il.dt.o^oftl^ch 10^870 ,0 with are British Indian interests, whether commercial or other.' Such In the India Office letter of April so, 1871. being the case, the objections to making appeal lie from the Persian and Memorandum of May 5, 187 1, the littoral to Teheran, and, a fortiori, to Constantinople, are obvious, opinion is expressed that the Persian (Among these are the distances to be travelled over roadless tracts, and the inadequacy of the means of communication.) And referring and that the Court of Appeal should be to the provisions of the British Indian law as distinguished from English Bombay.' law, it is presumed that 'the special provisions made to meet the ,)o9 P atcl1 tro1 ' ^esidentm Persian Gulf to r • i i. • r ,11 , .■« Government of Bombay, No. 473/129, peculiarities ot social, religious or other law or custom among the dated October 22, 1870! various sects and races of British India,' would be more applicable to cases wherein persons of those sects and races should be concerned. 18. If, then, appeal to the High Court of Bombay were deemed The Penal Code is intelligible and logical; preferable, it would follow that the law of British India, including the the En g lisl1 Criminal law is the reverse. Indian Penal Code, should properly govern the provisions of the Orders in Council, both for the Persian littoral and the other States bordering the Persian Gulf, not even excepting Turkish Arabia20 Appointment recommended of a Judge for Persia, on same footing as Judge at Constantinople. In his despatch No. 53, of December 80, 18/0, while discussing the desirability of rendering the Persian Courts independent of the Superior Court at Constantinople, and suggesting that appeals should lie to the I ligh Court of Bombay, Sir P. Praucis submits that 44 there is no advan tage in giving appeals from Courts constituted as the Persian Courts must be to other Courts, soch as that of the Minister of I eheran, who necessarily has no such special experience or aptitude in legal procedure as wculd offer any advantage in the administration of justice.' (Koweit), if, as regards that Province of Turkey, the terms of the Ottoman order could be modified accordingly. 19. We do not perceive that the law in question would be less suitable in all these regions than in India to British subjects of everv denomination, or to the circumstances of the communities amoti'- whom it is to work. &amp; 20. Assuming now that Her Majesty actually enjoys or may acquire rights ol jurisdiction in Persia, there is a separate measure relating to Appellate Courts which we desire very earnestly to urge on the notice of Her Majesty's Government, as even preferable to ren- deiing the High Court of Bombay, as herein-before contemplated, a Pirst Court ot Appeal, viz., the appointment of a Judge Or other Judicial Superintendent, having the requisite legal qualifications, with some experience in the practice of British India law, who should be commissioned as a Judge of Appeal much in the same manner, and having moreover the same powers of session and circuit as the Jud^e for Turkey at Constantinople. To be stationed at Bushire. Ottoman Order in Council again recorm mended for Persia. Vo be entrusted to Mr. F. S. Reilly for adaptation. 21. As the supervision of this officer would embrace Persia, Turkish-Arabia, the independent Arab States, Muscat, including the coast of Mekran, and also, if it were so desired, Zanzibar, we should recommend Bushire as a central position from which it could be most conveniently exercised. Through his agency the certain and imme diate execution of judgment, uniformity of procedure as of law, facility ot reference, not merely for purposes of investigation and appeal, but for guidance and advice in doubtful and exceptional cases, and a genera j judicial control would be secured to Consular jurisdiction throughout the wide exteftt of country referred to. It is presumed that this officer might also fill the office of Assistant-Resident at Bushire. 22. Assuming, too, that, on the establishment of British jurisdic tion in Persia, no essential diiference would be discernible between the rights, powers, and privileges accruing to Her Majesty in that country, and those pertaining to Her Majesty in Turkey, we would again express our opinion that the Ottoman Order in Council would form a proper and suitable basis for the Order in Council proposed for Persia. The said Ottoman Order embodies now the result of ten years' experience in a Mahomedan country. It has been from time to time amended, and is again appearing, after a careful revision, simplified both in form and matter. The Order and the rules of procedure, formerly kept apart, are now incorporated together, and this arrangement, though adding in appearance only to its bulk, constitutes, we believe, not the least of its merits. 23. 1 he revision of the Ottoman Order having been accomplished by Mr. F. S. Reilly (by whom it was originally drawn), after consulta tion with Sir P. Francis, we should recommend that the preparation of the Persian Order should be entrusted to the same person, whose previous experience and familiarity with details would enable him. without further assistance, to appreciate the requisite modifications! These modifications would be considerable or comparatively trifling, according as the question of appointing a Judicial Officer presiding over a Court of Appeal at Bushire were determined. If, then, in any respect, the rules and regulations of the Ottoman Order in Council, relating to technichal procedure in suits, should be found to be incom patible with British Indian law, though otherwise suitable, from their simplicity, for Consular practice generally, the changes desired in that sense should be pointed out by the Indian law authorities when the order is placed in Mr. Reilly's' hands, to be drafted for Persia. The attention also of the Indian Law Officers should be called to Division II., Section 6, of the Turkish Order in Council.21 24. Before quitting the subject of Persia, we desire to call Territorial dependency of Bassidore. attention to the somewhat anomalous condition of Bassidore, 'a station under the Hritish flag/' at the western end of the island of Kishm, ol which the nationality appears to be problematical. The nature of its dependency and the source of our tenure are set forth and defined by the Government of India as Persian and deriving from Persia. But this view was contested by the Government of Despatch to Government of Bombey iiombay, m whose opinion it were ^ politic to'ignore all connection No. 162/798 F. D., September 8, 1868,' between Persia and Bassidore, and to regard Muscat as the sole Power T , P ara &amp; ra P^ Si 2 and 3. from whom our right to Bassidore has been and continues to be X tC lo ^ Ko l 2 H derived.' On this point it does not fall within our province to offer and 's. ' 1 ' pai an opinion, but it is essential that the territorial dependency of Bassidore should be authoritatively determined, in order that British jurisdiction there may be referred either to the existing Order in Council for Muscat, or included as of course in the proposed Order in Council for Persia. 25. The circumstances of the island of Angaum, a British tele- Of Angaum. graph station, are similar to those of Bassidore. Our tenure of Angaum, however, is, it is said, fortified by the sanction of the Persian Government. In any case, we presume that provision for jurisdiction on either island would follow the decision in regard to the other. Angaum may be regarded as part of the island of Kishm. 26. The territories in the Persian Gulf, other than Persia and Other States of the Persian Gulf. the dependencies of Persia, in which it is desired by Order in Council Th . e 0rder 511 Council for Muscat was to legalize British jurisdiction, are those situate on the Arabian coast 1 ' sued on the 9th Au ^ U8t ' 1866 - (with adjoining islands), between the territory of Muscat on the one Koweit is a dependency of Turkey, and hand and the territory ot Jvoweit on the other, comprising the petty under the operation of the Turkish independent States of, — Order in Council. Eas ul Khymah. Enumerated. Shargah. Amulgavine. Egmaun. Debaie. Aboothabee. Bahrein,—island and dependencies on the main land. Wahabee Ports. 27. 1 he powers and jurisdiction of Her Majesty within these territories rest on sufferance and usage entirely, and are more than co-extensive with those exercised by Her Majesty in the Principalities ot Muscat and Zanzibar, which are in some degree limited by treaty stipulations. Add to this consideration, that there are no Political or Consular Oiflcers other than English accredited to the independent Arab Chieftains,—that there are no foreigners, being Europeans, resident, or likely to become resident, within their territories,—that the foreign trade with their ports is prosecuted exclusively by native craft carrying the British, Persian, Turkish, or Muscat colours, and finally, that the maritime police of the Gulf being actually in British hands, appeal is customarily made to the interference or good offices ot the British Political Resident on all the graver occasions of grievance suffered or inflicted by a foreign subject within the limits of the States referred to, it follows that the object and effect of the proposed Order in Council for these States must be simply to legalize the judicial acts of British Political and Consular Officers, neither to extend nor to limit the exercise of their jurisdiction. 28. The ports of the AVahabee Government are specified by the British Political Resident in his enumeration of the territories under his official charge, but we are without information as to the present dependency of those ports. They may fall within the category of independent Arab States (to which category, hitherto, we have prac tically held them to belong, leaving them to be directly dealt with by our Political Resident), or having in recent years been invaded, if not subjugated by a Turkish expeditionary force acting by sea from ' [87] * ' G Jurisdiction based on sufferance and usage exclusively. Wahabee ports. Letter to Government of Bombay, No. 473/ 129, October 22, 1870. The Wahabee Ameer, subsequent to the. first and second Egyptian invasions, has paid tribute to the Porte through the Shereefs of Mecca.22 Special provision for jurisdiction not needed. These remarks apply equally to the aggres sions of the Wahabees on Muscat terri- tory. Despatch from Government of India to the Duke of Argyll, No. 19, January 24, 1873, paragraph 17. The condition of Koweit is peculiar. Though paying no tribute to Turkey, the Koweit Chiefs have always acknowledged and pleaded allegiance to the Porte, and Koweit vessels have always carried the Turkish flag. Bussorah, they may be regarded as integral portions of Ottoman territory. 29. Referring, however, to the incessant political changes on the Arabian continent, to the doubtful and irregular control exerted by the Ottoman Porte over its ^uasi-Arabian tributaries, also their virtual autonomy wherever the authority of the Porte is not ostensibly recognized, we submit that the definition of Wahabee territory is unnecessary. It mast be sufficient for purposes of British jurisdiction that this territory should be found comprised and generally enume rated within the limits to be prescribed to this proposed Order in Council as above stated, viz., the territory of Muscat on the one side, the territory of Koweit on the other. Muscat Order in Council generally suitable to Arab States. Ibid., paragraph 11. 0 The Order in Council for Muscat may a guide for the new Order, Correspondence passim. be taken as 30. As suggested by the Government of India, we are of opinion that the Order in Council for Muscat (being mutatis mutandis identical with the Order for Zanzibar) is the best suited by its terms and structure to the circumstances of the Arab States. It would be sub ject, of course, to the modifications which spring from the absence of any Treaty obligations to the latter, and from the assurance that Despatch from Government of lJom ay, g ri tish jurisdiction there, based on sufferance and usage, may safely No. 6,161, October 26,18/2, paragraphs. .

Defects of Muscat Order. • Touching the peculiarities and defects of the Muscat Order Despatch from Government of India to the in Council, commented upon by the Government of India, if, as has Duke of Argyll, No. 19, January 24, t) ecn assumed, the jurisdiction authorized by that Order is 'narrower 1873, paragraph 17. than in Persia and other places,' this must be the consequence of D lluke' 1 elf 19! January 0 24! restrictions imposed by Treaty, which, though hardly to be set aside 1873, paragraphs' 8,11,12, and 13. in respect to Muscat itself may be eliminated from that Order in so far as they should be found to affect the Arab States. Again, we would remark that, althougli British criminal jurisdiction in the Signed May 81, 1839: ratified July 22, Muscat dominions is restricted by Article IY of the Treaty of 1839, 1840. ' the Order in Council of 4th November 1867 (being nevertheless, it seems, 'framed on the broader basis of sufferance and usage') Act 35. « And it is further ordered, that contains a provision, Article 35, than which it would be difficult to the provisions of this Order shall extend find terms admitting of more comprehensive interpretation.

Modifications proposed in existing Muscat Order. Amendments desired in Order in Council for Muscat and for Arab States. not be hampered with the limitations of Article V, which obtain at Muscat. 32. Here also the varying bases of jurisdiction seem to bar the course proposed by the Government of India to include Muscat in a General Order in Council applicable to all the States bordering the Persian Gulf (excepting Koweit, 'if the existing arrangements regarding Turkey should not admit of modification '), to which end it is suggested ' to modify the Muscat Order accordingly,' or, ' as the better plan, to repeal the Muscat Order entirely.' 33. The modifications, however, which, in conformity with the views of the Indian Government, arc required in the existing ()rder in Council for Muscat, would be not less desirable in the application ot thai Order as the basis of jurisdiction in the independent Arab States. These modifications refer more especially to the course of appeal and to the law to be administered in both territories. They are the same as those recommended in the adaptation of the Turkish ()rder to the Persian littoral (and, if practicable, to the interior ot Persia and to Turkish Arabia), viz., to constitute appeal in all cases civil and criminal to the High Court of Bombay (or, still better, primarily to a Judge or superintending Judicial Officer at Bushire) instead of to England or to Constantinople, and the British Indian law with penal code the law to be administered instead of English law. 34. The task of effecting these modifications might be entrusted also to Mr. Reilly, to whom we would suggest the following amend ments as desirable in the Orders in Council to be applied to both of the territories in question :— (1.) The scope of British jurisdiction might, w r e think, be23 extended (as in the revised Order for China and Japan) to British vessels or the vessels of Arab States at sea within the limits of the Persian Gulf. (2.) The penalty for non-registering, viz., loss of British protec tion within the dominions, &amp;c., seems to he of questionable etficacy. Liability to fine should be superadded, as in the Ottoman Order at the discretion of the Controlling Consular officer : and some iurther pro vision should be made (consistently with the new Act oi Naturaliza tion) against the attempt to repudiate British allegiance, with the view of evading British jurisdiction, more especially in respect to the interdict on purchasing, selling, or holding slaves. (3.) With regard to the appropriation of fines, penalties, &amp;c,, it would be expedient to give the Consul a general discretion to bestow the whole or part of the penalty in the form of compensation or damages to the persons aggrieved. (4.) Eeferring to the difficulties of obtaining everywhere in the Persian Gulf competent assessors, it would be desirable that, in the exercise also of the larger powers assigned to them. Consuls should have full discretion to dispense with their services whenever witliin a reasonable time, assessors cannot be procured. Consuls should also have power (especially in cases where protected subjects are involved in the suit) to nominate foreigners to be assessors. (5.) Should a judicial officer be appointed to Bushire, his powers of fine and imprisonment in the several countries within his jurisdic tion might properly be enlarged to the extent prescribed in the Turkish Order in Council. (6.) No penalty is assigned in the Muscat Order for persons returning to the country from whence they have been deported. This offence, as in Turkish Order, should be punishable by fine or imprisonment, and, in extreme cases, at the discretion of the Consul, by the withdrawal of British protection from the otfemfcr. (7.) The provision of the Turkish Order referring to offences against religion should be inserted in the proposed Order lor the independent Arab States, and in the revised Order tor Muscat and Zanzibar. 35. Eeferring to the discussions marginally noted as to the classes of persons subject to British jurisdiction, this matter would seem rather to be one for supplementary regulation or instruction than for definition in the terms ot an Order in ( ouncil. 1 he extremest latitude that should be allowed may be hedged by con ditions involving registration, the written consent, in doubtful cases, of the person protected, or, in the case oi a foreigner, the recog nition, similarly declared, of the Government to which he may be subject. 36. But a large discretion must necessarily be left, we think, to the controlling authority, and Consular Officers should also, as recommended by the Government of India, have power to ' remit cases to the Courts of the country when they consider that justice can so be better done;' in other words, to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction in such cases. 37. It only remains for us to report on the two other points submitted to our consideration, relating, the one to certain modifica tions desired in the existing Commercial Treaty with Persia, the other, to the establishment of Mixed Tribunals for the adjudication of cases in which British subjects are plaintiffs, and Persians (or other foreigners) defendants. 38. The first of these has been so exhaustively treated in the despatch of the Government of India to the Duke of Argyle as to be now ripe for negotiation between Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran and the Persian Government, whenever, following the action of his Russian colleague, ' a favourable opportunity should be afforded for placing the whole subject before the Persian Minister, with a view to This, we believe, will be given in the revised Ottoman Order.

It is very desirable, in the opinion of Sir P. Francis, that we should both be entrusted with that duty at Constantinople. 40. The advantages of the proposed measure, not merely in its bearing upon the interests of British subjects, but in educating Persian officials to a right sense of their obligations, atid to the just and proper exercise of their functions, can hardly be exaggerated, and receive their best illustration in the effects produced in Turkey. Its success, however, we apprehend, must in the highest degree- depend upon the sympathy and support of other foreign Powers having Treaty relations with Persia, more especially Russia, a'nd it would rest with the Government to consider whether and to what extent it might be expedient to invite combined action in its prosecu tion. 41. (t will be remembered that the establishment of Mixed Tribunals strikes at the root of the worst features of Mahomedan administration. They would supersede the influence and agency ol^ the religious Courts. They would gradually undermine religions prejudices and^ obnoxious rules, and remove those anomalies in the law of evidence and other laws affecting the civil rights of Christians, which are too familiar to need comment, and which were found to be so pernicious in the administration of justice in Turkey. 42. But the initiation of this measure must necessarily be post poned until the points we have submitted in regard to the principles and structure of the Order for Persia shall have been considered and determined by Her Majesty's Government in England and in tndia.

Mr. Abbott's authority is not worth much, as he was a very indifferent political officer, and a still worse jurist; however, on matters of fact he may of course be trusted, as he was thoroughly honest and straightforward. —(See paragraphs 3 and 4 of Report.) In Turkey we have special capitulations —{See paragraph 5 of Report.) Under the capitulations.— {See paragraph 5 of Report, as follows:—' Though by usage hitherto conceded to us in Egypt.') Our right of jurisdiction depends, I pre sume, under the most favoured nation clause, on the Russian right, and the Russian right is not even conferred by treaty (at least the Vllth and VHIth Articles of the Treaty of Turcomanchai, as far as I remember, are merely general, and do not specify juisdic- 'iion), but merely follows from ' sufferance and usage,' which diplomatically is insuffi cient ground.— {See paragraph 6 of Re port.) I do not think the Turkish Orders in Council suited to Persia under present cir cumstances, but it may become so if our right of jurisdiction is defined by a Con vention, analagous to the Turkish capitula tions.— {See paragraph 6 of Report.) I quite concur in this.— (See last sentence of paragraph 10 of Report.) Is the Crown competent to make British subjects amenable to the Indian I^enalCode in an independent country like Persia ? If so, what is to prevent the introduction of British Indian law into Europe (at Constan tinople, for instance), or into any of our Colonies ?— {See paragraph 11 of Report.) The phrase is, ** in the establishment and recognition of Consuls/' that is, in respect to their authority and privileges, not in respect to the number to be appointed. At any rate this point should be decided by authority.—(.See paragraph 13 of Report.) Reply of Sir A. Kemball. seriously endorsed by the Persian Govern- ment. In short, we could not consistently advo cate the concession of a privilege by the Porte which we have not ourselves recipro cated to the Persians in Indian—this, too, when the Porte has never disputed, but the British Government has refused to tolerate, the natural right of the native authorities to exercise jurisdiction over British and Turkish subjects respectively in Persia. I have advisedly used the word ' tolerate ' to characterize our past action in Persia. If 'usage and sufferance ' be inadmissible, and 'the most favoured nationplea in adequate to justify the continued exercise of British Consular jurisdiction in Persia, it would not be easy to define otherwise the ground on which we have hitherto main tained (without demur on the part of the Persian Government) that the British sub ject is not amenable to the lex loci. For the rest, the proposed Order in Council is intended only to legalize the jurisdiction and to validate the acts of British Consular Officers. It would be without force or effect in over-riding Persian rights beyond the point to which they had been prescriptively suffered to fall into abeyance—in other words, to which we had been prescriptively suffered to ignore them. It is at any rate presumed that, come what may, the British Government would not consent to relinquish British subjects to the chances of Persian judicial administra tion. If, then, 'usage and sufferance,' , and ' the most favoured nation ' clause of the Russian Treaty were insufficient justifi cation of such a course, the proposal at least to supersede these pleas by a special convention would not be without risk. If unreservedly made, it mighi involve, in its rejection, the abrogation of privileges not hitherto disputed. The Report by no means insists upon the basis of ' usage and sufferance' beyond the point to which it could be substantiated by the practice of the most favoured nation. It suggests, on the contrary, that incon venience might result from exceptional pre tensions. The Indian Despatches, however, on the ground of usage, sufferance, and prescription, argue that England, not Russia, may be practically the most favoured nation. The provisions of the English Treaty of 1857, and of the Russian Treaties con cluded both at Turcomanchai in 1S28, are subjoined:—Remarks by Sir H. Rawlinson. TWs is decidedly the preferable course.— {See paragraph 15 of Report.) 1 doubt whether Persia would concede a right of jurisdiction (by special convention) to our Consuls, if such jurisdiction were saddled with a right of appeal to a Foreign Court at Constantinople or Bombay. Nor would it be tair to Persian suitors pfose- cuting I British subjects before a Consular Court in Persia that the defendant, if cast, should have the power of re-opening the suit in Turkey or in India. By far the best arrangement would be to have a special Judge of Appeal for Persia and the Gulf (as in paragraph 21) located in Bushire, but going once a year on circuit to Teheran, Kesht, and Tabriz to hear appeals, and I rather think I British law would be preferable to the Indian Penal Code, which in many cases defers too much to Mahomedan feel- ings, as, for instance, in making adultery a misdemeanour.—(See paragraphs 18, 19,and 20 of Report.) But compare paragraph 16. The Assistant Resident could hardly be Consul invested with judicial powers, and Judge of Appeal also. He would have/ in fact, to hear ap peals from his own decisions.— )See para graph 21 of Report.) In view of the probable employment of a large number of British engineers and arti ficers in Persia in connexion with the Renter concession, this establishment of mixed tribunals for adjudicating cases in which British subjects or proteges are claimants seems to be of great importance, and any such proposals would, I think, be favourably received by the Persian Government.— {See paragraph 39 of Report.) Reply of Sir A. Kemhall. Article IX of Treaty of Peace between Great Britain and Persia, dated 4th March, 1857, Paris. 1 be High Contracting Parties engage, that in the establishment and recognition of Consuls-General, Consuls, Yice-Consuls, and Consular Agents, each shall be placed in the dominions of the other on the footing of the most favoured nation, and that the treatment of their respective subjects and their trade shall also in every respect be placed on the footing of the treatment of the subjects and commerce of the most favoured nation.

There is probably some misconception in ascribing grounds of umbrage to Persia, in consequence of the proposal to render the course of appeal to Constantinople or to Bombay instead of to England. The pro posal means no more than that, according as English law or British Indian law were preferred as the law to be administered by the British Consular Courts in Persia, appeal would lie from those Courts to Her Majesty's Supreme Consular Courts at Con stantinople, or to Her Majesty's High Court of Judicature in Bombay, that is, in either case, from one British Court to a higher British Court. So far as foreign Governments are con cerned, British Indian law or Colonial law are quite as much English law as the law properly so called, seeing that laws are enacted throughout Her Majesty's domi nions, wherever situated, under the autho rity, and subject to the revision and veto, of the Crown and Imperial Parliament. The conditions of legislation in each case are prescribed by statute, and are adapted to the circumstances of the several depen dencies concerned. The reason for constituting British Indian law the law to be administered in Persia is set forth in paragraph 17 of the Report, viz., that the great majority of persons coming under its operation would be British Indian subjects. On the other hand. Eng lishmen affected thereby, while residing in Persia, would be in no worse position than their more numerous countrymen living under the same law in India.
