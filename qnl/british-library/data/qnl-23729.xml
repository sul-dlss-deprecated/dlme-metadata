MEMOBAUDUM The Hon* 'ble the Political Eesident has noticed that many clerks and in particular recent recruits either cannot type at all or can only type at such a low speed that they are unable to assist in this 'branch of office work. It should'iLmpressed on all ministerial staff that every clerk must learn to type reasonably efficiently if he wishes to earn promotion. Clerks should 'be encouraged to practise typing in their spare time and typewriters should whenever possible ibe made available for this purpose. 2. In order to ascertain their progress in typing all clerks in the Besidency office, who have not attained a minimum speed of 30 words per minute, have to appear for a monthly typing test. It has been found convenient to set a test paper of 300 words and allow 10 minutes for it to be typed. Four words are deducted from the total number of words typed for each mistake made. 3. It is requested that a similar test may be held in your office each month and that the result of the test may be communicated for the information of the Hon* ble the Political Eesident. sm.

The clerks of this Agency are at present overworked and hav«3 to attend office in the afternoons and evenings in order to keep abreast of their duties. They therefore have no spare time in which to practise typing for typing^ sake, although they all have to type in the course of their duties. 3. It is therefore felt that their standard cannot improve very rapidly and I suggest that half yearly typing teot^ would be sufficient to murk any progress that has been made.

Those members of your clerical staff who have attained a typing speed of 30 words or more a minute need not appear again for the typing tests. 3. The Hon'ble the Political Resident realizes that several offices are hard worked but considers that it is essential that there should be a general improvement in the standard of typing. For this reason he wishes monthly typing tests to be held in your office as in other offices under this Residency. SDN.No. 1739-15/41 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. The 14th 0 une 1944.
