There is a reference to an enclosure that is not transcribed in the volume. Stannus reports that the Imam of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd] had expressed his concern that the British had apparently allowed the Joassmees [Quwāsim] to act offensively against his subjects. Stannus, in response, had explained that under the articles of the treaty the British had no right to check the hostile proceedings of the allied tribes. However, since his return to Bombay, Stannus had been informed that the treaty of alliance confirmed by Sir John Malcolm expressly declared that the enemies of one state should be considered the enemies of the other, and this fully accounted for the Imam's expectations of British support.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024055009.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
