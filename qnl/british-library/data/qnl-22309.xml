His eyes are light in colour and of good size. He wears a light brown beard of neat and close appearance. He is normally grave and rather sad but has a good smile which changes his appearance very pleasantly. He seems to be sensible and clear headed in contrast to his exitable bedouin brothers. He is to a certain extent under the domination of Shaikh Khalifah, his uncle, a wealthy man who has never hesitated to have anyone likely to be inju rious to his own interests removed even though they were his own brothers, and Ahmad bin Khalaf, an at one time wealthy pearl merchant. He is very hospitable. He pre fers to be up at Baraimi where the water is good and air drier than at his port of Abu Dhabi. He has many expen ses and is by no means well off. He appears to be an in dividual who would only give his word after considerable pressure but once given could be relied on to keep it.© • a haikh Sultan bin Saqr - Jawasimi Ruler of Sharjah. A young man of medium height* of light complexion with a dark brown full beard and a new set of false teeth. Possessed of a liking for sweets and a dislike of physical violence. He is intelligent and untrustworthy like his cousin of Has al Khaimah but has not the nimble wit of that gentleman. He is well mannered and dressed well. He is advised by his Secretary ! Abdullah bin Paris, a local man. The usual council carry no weight with him.

He is quick tongued and on occasions is inclined to allow his tongue to outrun his judgment. Has an active brain and enjoys agrument at which he is particularly adept. Is reputed to be well off and is known for his meanness. He lax is inclined to be £xsks with the bedouins and does not inspire as much respect in them as his son Salim does. He has an incurable habit of interfering in matters which do not concern him. If his quick brain could be employed for the benefit of his state, he would make a progressive ruler. Like all his tribe, reacts favourably to threats and a show of strength on the part of Government. He is not in the habit of keeping his word to his fellow rulers. As far as his people are concerned, he is not a tyrannical ruler and the country is reasonably prosperous.Has al Khaimah - 1937. Issue Sultan bln Salim, aged 45. - 50.

An elderly man of some sixty years, of middle height; of good appearance, light complexion and wears a full beard turning grey. Has good eyes and the family characteristic, a hooked nose (he is addicted to snuff). He is dominated in many things by a clever and forceful wife who trades, owns landed property and generally takes an interest in the town and state. He is very hospitable and is well liked by the bedouin. He has a large and influential council whom he normally consults on matters of importance but he can generally be induced to see reason if he is approached when he is alone. He is well mannered and by no means a fool. In fact he is one of the pleasantest persons on the Coast with whom to have dealings as he always behaves as a gentle man. Probably his wife exerts more influence over affairs than he does himself, but her influence is in her husband^s interest. He is not well off although the port of Dubai is easily the most important on the Coast, as he entertains considerably and gives a considerable sum away to the bedouin every month. He is keen 6n hawking and poisoning fish. He is a good sailor and a judge of camels. Hunting, fishing and shooting and the ancestory of his camels are the topics of conversation he prefers. \Shaikh Said bin Maktum, aged about 60 years.
