It is obvious that there is no access to Sha'a.m by land,and that it is only accessible by sea,i.e. from B ai * ah to Xamsar and thence to Sha'am. I \m of opinion that the Shaikh of Pas-el-'Ihaim.eh is justi fied in subduing the people of Sha'am and putting the place in o^der,as it is a village which is visited b foreigners during both summer and winter.

Meanwhile shaikh Hamdan ben 7 a id received news that Hamad had come to rh8rp;ah. The C h a i 1: \ ordered his brother, S^qar -ben 7aid, to set off with 150 camel riders to go and arrest Hamad wherever he is on the Coast. S a qar ben Zaid quickly came to the suburbs of Debai by land and learnt that Ham&amp;d was at Shargah. Saqar informed the Shaikh of Debai that he had come to arrest H^mad at Hhargah and that the uhaikh of Debai should ^ome to rharpah and assist him in arresting Hamad. Saqar ben Z^id came to ^hargah with his men and the Chaikh of nhargah welcomed him % hospitably and assigned him a house in the town because there are friendly relations between the Shaikh of fhargah and 1 Shaikh I'andan. A^ter one day Saqar ben Zaid asked the Shaikh s of Shargah to hand over to him Hamad and his Awamer compa nions. The Shaikh of Shargah replied that Hamad was his guest and that a guest stiould be respected and not insulted as long /} i as he was in the host f s house and that when he (Hamad) went away, they could do what they pleased^ Saqar said he had come u • / to arrest Hamad and that^wnuld not help doing so. ^hen the Shaikh of Shargah saw that S.aqar insisted on the apprehension of I^\0 Hamad he sent for' the Ehsilch o ^ Unn-ul -Q» if a in to ^one Shargah and effect a reconciliation between hin and naqar ben Zaid in connection with the case of K^nad.

They agreed, however, to guarantee that he (Hamad i would not create any disturbances in Shaikh Hamdan's district, Gaqar ben Zaid did not arrree to this saying that either Hamad should be expelled from Chargah at once or be handed to him. When the Shaikh of Chargah sav/ that the town was crowded with the people of Debai and Bedouins, he ordered the inhabitants of Shargah to take arms and 'guard the towers of the town and sent to the DhaiVh o'P ^lebai and Taqar ben ?aid to leave Shapgah with their men? but they did not agree to leave unless Hamad was handed to them. There was therefore a very great crowd of men at Shargah each with a rifle in his hand. As I was at Debai since I left you on 'Lawrence' at Dsbai I was informed by the British and Persian subjects residing at Chargah of the great crowd o^ the Bedouins and others in the town of ohargah.

A.C. * I hare the honour to report that on HErd July 10in a boat from Hafoon, the Nakhuda of which was a ^onali, cane to Ras -ul-Khaimeh entered the creek and the Nakhuda landed the chandals he had brought in the boat for sale, ^he crew scattered in the town and in the date gardens of Ras-ul- Khainah for the purpose of selling the goods they had brought with themselves such as mattings, yellow dyes etc. Two Honaii men of the boat went to a village called F.hut. After selling their things they returned to Ras-ul -Khaimeh. • On their w»^-back, near the village of Hayal, one of the suburbs' of Ras-ul-Khaineh, they net with 3 Bedouins. The / latter killed one of the Coraalis while the other man made good his escape to that village. Ke then went to Ras-ul- ^haimeh aid informed the Makhuda of the 0 oat o^ what ha^, happened to them on the way and the Nakhuda informed the Shaikh of Ras -ul-^haimeh of the matter. The Sheikh at once . collected 20 Bedouins he had with hin and sent tnem to the place where the Gomali had been murdered. They enquired about the murderers and learned that 2 Bedouins of Khawater tribe had killed the Somali. They returned to the Shaikh an'? informed him of the murderers. The Shaikh of Ras-ul-^haimeh therefore gathered about 200 men and went to arrest the murderers. The news reached the Bedouins of Khawater tri^o one of whom, named Ali ben Saif, made away with the murderer and took refuge with the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain. The latter wrote a letter to the . Shaikh of Ras-ul-Khaimeh stating that Ali ben Saif Al-K^teri and his followers had become his dependents and that any claimsAN ^ r c-la ins against them should referred to hin* The fhaikhg^ of Ras -ul -K ^aimeh informed the Comalis that the murderer was with the Snaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain and gave them a copy of that Shaikh's letter to himself. The Gomalis went to the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain and returned without obtaining their right from the murderer. T^e Gomalis therefore told the Shaikh of pas-ul-Khaimeh that their friend had been killed in a village belonging to him and that they would take the bioodmoney from the people of Ras-ul-^Iiaimeh if they meet with them in their country when they proceed to Zanzibar in their boats. The ^omalis left Ras -ul-rhaimeh in their boat for their town Hafoon. • m ! 7C 1/ tew &lt;5-v * * \ M t 9 s( '■ tJ If t&gt; be L- h* ' Or y ^Ct*, U* ■i- /jT I}(o(o/ wo v /23I2- of 1928. isritish residency &amp; uonsulate-G-eneral, iiushire^ the | DecemlDer 1928. %*&gt; k A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to ri.B.M's Vice-uonsul for Khuzistan, Ahwaz, for information and report. ±jy Order, i«aj or, secretary to the Political Kesident in the Persian G-ulf.

Then the f!haikh of Ras-ul-^haimeh sent a nan to his nephew, the Shaikh of Shapgah, informing him of the actions of Ali ben V Saif and his followers, but he got no satisfactory answer. Owing to the troubles that the said individual created for the Shaikh of P.as-ul-Khaimeh f the latter himself with 300 men attacked the camel flocks of the Khawater Bedouins and the Shaikh of Umm-ul -Qa iwain and carried off about 50 camels. When the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain was informed of the plunder \ of the camels he reported it to the Shaikh of Shargah and the latter sent his brothers, Rashed ben Ahmad to Ras-ul- J[haineh and Abdullah ben Ahmad, to Umm-ul-Qaiwain to effect a reconciliation between the two Shaikhs. After the conclu sion of peace and the restoration of the camels to the Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain, the latter broke the peace saying that AiiAli ben Saif &amp;xii his follccr 8 'h® brother of the Shaikh of Shargah, Abdullah ben Ahmad, supparted the Shaikh of Uram-ul-Qaiwain their object being to separate the said Bedouins fron Ras-ul-rhaimeh as they are able to close traffic with then if they continue to be the subject of the Shaikh of Ras-ul-Ehaimeh. I have heard that the Shaikh of Unwul-Qaiwain sent rice and dates to his garden in the interior and that he is collecting his Bedouins and intends to fight the Ghaikh of Ras-ul-^naineh» I understood also that the Shaikh of Shargah will send his brother Abdullah ben Ahraad to help the rhaikh of Umn-ul -Qaiwain against that of Ras-ul-^haineh. 7he latter has asked his Allies, the Shaikhs of Ajman and Debai, to help him and they hare pronised to send him help if the Shaikh of Shargah sends his brother to the Shaikh of Unm-ul- Qaiwain. I hear fighting will take place shortly between Ras-ul-Khaineh and Umm-ul-Qai^ain.H.'.S.

After I passed Ras -ul-xWimeh and cane to Shargah I was informed that a dispute has arisen between you and Shaikh'Sultan ben Sal en about a naterially unimportant thmr which could be easily settled. But, on the contrary, it has P one ^rom bad to worse and led to raids by one party on the other, jour tribe being the first to do so. Now apparently you are ready to fi^ht. As Shaikh vhaled ben Ahmad, Chief of Sharfrah, has told ne that he intends to come to you and try to effect a reconciliation, it beioves Mil ne to write this friendly letter to you and give you good advice. ! trust you will listen to my advice, accept Shaikh r.haled's intercession , and nake peace because the result of war is not good and produces nothing except the destruction of lives and property. Tt ''ill certainly affect the subiects the British Government in that they nay lose their claims against your subjects and those of Ras -ul-jhaineh. If you refuse (to listen to this advice) and fighting occurs between you and losses sustained by the subjects of the High Government who have claims against your subjects and those of the other party, you will be held responsible for the payment of alL the losses sustained by British subjects on both sides. I hope you '/ill accept ny advice and try to nake oeace which is better for both parties and which will please me. 4u^' 1 , , LIE a-ji-c 01■MB——a—»—. - m tlJ From- The Residency Af;ent, Char^ah % ^he Deputy political Resiient# Persian Culf, Bushire To - No. 927 dated 30th December 1010.

The Shaikh of Umm-ul-Qaiwain T s observations in his lettei to Your Honour does not'show that he will abide by the perce made by the Shaikh of S^argah according to your surrestion, but states that he is not satisfied because the Shaikh of Ras-ul-^haimeh carried off his camels, though this was done by both of them when they were on bad terms. From the con tents of this letter I .consider that .the Shaikh of Umm-ul- Qa iwain A611 . Unm-ul-Qaiwain has nade the present peace temporarily in order to place the Shaikh of Has-ul-r.haineh off his guards. . I would suggest that lour Honour nay ^/rite a strict letter to the Shaikh of Unm-ul-Qaiw&amp;in warning hin against creatinr any trouble and violating the present peace, 'his is useful for causing the Shaikh to he quiet.

Certainly if the ^a&amp;b men kill one of the men of Umm-ol-^aiwen, th^re will be trouble between the Shaikhs of Ras-ol-I'haimeh and Jmm-ol- .aiwan, and dA will be a violation of the a^reeBent formed ;.fc5 i- through me between the two Shaikhs.

He reili^d that he will communicate with the Zaab and let me have a reply in a months time. I explained to him the rule and usage on the Arafe Coast about the acceptance of blood money for a man who is killed accidentally. In the year 1'534 a man of Gha'm killed a man of A»man, and the Ghaikh's father, Chaikh Galem ben Coltan, paidhis tlood money to the Chaikrh of Ajman.
