The Use of Aeroplanes in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. t s Note by Lteut.-Col. A. T. WILSON, Civil Commissionbb, Baghdad. Part I.—South-West Persia. 1- The Deputy Political Resident, Bnshire, recently addressed the Government 0 ff ^ f s^strng that the controlling authorities in Shiraz would be more effectively supported throughout the Province by the presence of aeroplanes than b} 7 expensive Persian gendarmerie of doubtful calibre, and urged that the general question of aviation in Persia should be taken into active consideration with a view to presenting the Persian Government, with the least possible delay, with an effective force capable of immediate utilisation, thus curtailing as far as possible the stay of our military forces in South-West Persia, where they have been off and on for the past foui years at enormous expense engaged principally in maintaining order on behalf of the Persian Government. 2. The Government of India replied as follows :— 'The possible introduction of aviation in operations in Persia has been under consideration for some time: problem, however, is attended with serious difficulty. Owing to absence of moior roads and roughness of the country, the aeroplanes used would have to have wide radius of action, and recovery of any obliged to make a forced landing would be generally impossible. Aviation in Southern Persia, therefore, would be attended with considerable danger. Indeed, it is only with use of latest pattern of aeroplane that it would be feasible at all. It would for similar reasons be highly expensive, especially as it is against present policy to train other than British personnel to aviation work. To use of aviation as a permanent instrument for police work in peace time in Southern Persia, there are additional and still more weighty objections : the impossibility, for instance, of discrimination between innocent and guilty in carrying out punitive measures by aeroplane, and necessity of protection and support by regular troops which would mean the permanent location of regular garrisons in several posts in Bushire hinterland. Latter consideration alone precludes aviation being (to quote your words) presented to Persian Government as an effective force capable of being utilised immediately and curtailing as far as possible the stay of our troops in the country,' 3. It seemed clear from this reply that the Government of India has not adequately appreciated the very great practical and moral value of aeroplanes—for which General Officer Comm^iding, Bushire, has been pressing for months past; and both I and my deputy urged on Major-General Salmond the importance of pressing for their despatch (they could have been spared for months past from Mesopotamia). This he was successful in doing, and on return from a visit by air to Bushire with the flight despatched thither, I telegraphed to the India Office as follows — 'I submit for consideration of His Majesty's Government that question, which I regard as of vital importance and as likely to modify our future dispositions in Persia, should not be regarded as being disposed of by foregoing pronouncement. ' For past six months we have maintained from Baghdad a flight of aeroplanes at Kasvin whose radius of action has extended to Senna, Urumia, Tabriz and Baku. This work has been carried on at a great personal risk to pilots with machines not the latest pattern. Now, however, the best machines are available. The flight now at Mosul is in a position to control Sulaimaniyah, Rowanduz, Zakho, and places even further distant. ' Landing grounds have been prepared at every town of importance in occupied territories between Baghdad and Baku, Arabistan, on oil fields and at Tehran.

'Aeroplanes are now being used with success in connection with operations ot Bushire Expeditionary Force; it can scarcely be doubted that, had thev been made available two years ago, the present situation in Fars would never have arisen. . 'if I may express a personal opinion, the establishment of works and hangars at Bushire, combined with landing grounds at all principal to\\ns, and petiol stores at all places where British officials are posted in South Persia, would go far towards solving the problem. _ . 4: It will be borne in mind Bushire is an important stopping place on mam air route from Europe to India, and expenditure on workshops there will thus serve a double object. Workshop lorries could probably even now reach bhiraz from Kasvin via Tehran and Ispahan with a little work, and it is within my personal knowledge that construction of roads fit for motors from Shiraz to most of principal points in Fars would involve little difficulty or expense.' 4. I added that I had seen a good deal during the past ten years of the limitations troops in Persia, and had practical experience of the use of aeroplanes for police purposes in Mesopotamia and West Persia. Experience shows that effective discrimi nation can be exercised, and there is less risk of complications on the way to and from the scene of action, and greater moral effect. The attitude of tribes is : ' We are not afraid of your troops. Guns cannot reach us ; but we cannot fight, against your air craft.' In point of fact the advent 'of the aeroplanes and their active partici pation against the tribes had an important and in my opinion determining effect on the position, and within six weeks from their arrival (I speak from memory) opposition to our troops was at an end. 5. A complete chain of landing grounds has been made under my orders from Baghdad to the Indian frontier, extending all down the northern shore of the Gulf; landing grounds have also been made on the Bushire-Shiraz road. A motor road from Bundar Abbas to Shiraz is under construction, and, if completed, will make it possible to maintain an aerodrome there. Aeroplanes could then co-operate with locdfl levies, disperse hostile gatherings, and generally assist the Persian Government to maintain order at a far less cost and with less military and political liability than troops. Ihis point of view has been specifically endorsed by Sir P. Cox, His Majesty's Minister. Tehran. 6. Ihere are now T only two machines at Bushire, and those of an unsuitable type. 7. I submit that a flight of aeroplanes should be kept at Bushire in the winter and at bhiraz in the summer. If this was done the withdrawal of our military forces so urgently desired by the Government of India and so necessary on political and financial grounds—would then be possible except for a small garrison on pre-war lines, \iz., one regiment. Troubles will no doubt recur, but they should not be so enous as again to demand our armed intervention; the shortage of ammunition can be ^ ii J y j vnHBnnnnBBMBBBBnHnHHnHHHHHHHHHHHHHHI 1 ' •■•,■&lt;•••■ - -■ .... .^ rwT ^ ? f V &gt; ^ ■ -f Part II.—Mesopotamia. 8. The population of Mesopotamia is 2|- millions, the area 125,000 square miles • the density of population is thus 20 per square mile; the area within which our army lias to maintain order is some 1,000 miles long and 50 to 400 miles broad ; the tribes on all four sides are turbulent, nomadic, and most difficult if not impossible to deal with by troops. The situation within our boundaries is much the same. 9. The Civil Administration is at present collecting the revenue in full all over the occupied territory and order is being maintained better than at any time within living memory ; our ability to go on doing so depends on the maintenance of adequate forces to repress trouble wherever it occurs immediately. This has been done hitherto by aeroplanes with very satisfactory results. 10. Communications in Mesopotamia are bad and will remain so for many years . the country is, however, very favourable for flying ; if the Civil Administration is to work efficiently—and on this depends our ability to hold Mesopotamia—it must be able to call on the Royal Air Force to provide planes to carry high officials from place to place. This should be done by the same aeroplanes as may be required for punitive purposes in order that the pilots and observers may become thoroughly familiar with the country. 11. I therefore submit that as soon as peace has been signed the Officer Commanding Royal Air rorce in Mesopotamia should be authorised to correspond direct with Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia, and to comply, subject to the exigencies of the service, with requisitions for aeroplanes for passenger purposes (at present this has to be done through General Headquarters, and all correspondence whatever between Royal Air Force and Civil Administration has to pass through the military authorities). Applications lor aeroplanes for. punitive purposes would be made through the military authorities. 12. 1 submit that the three squadrons allocated to Mesopotamia should be made up to strength at-the earliest possible date with machines suitable for use in punitive operations at long distances. Scout machines, if required, to be surplus to establishment. 13.

If three squadrons are maintained I anticipate that, provided troubles in India and Egypt do not increase and spread to Mesopotamia, it should be possible to reduce the existing garrison materially—the British infantry, however, remaining as at present. It should be possible to reduce the Indian troops by 50 per cent.: this is desirable on political as well as on financial grounds. 16th April 1919. A. T.
