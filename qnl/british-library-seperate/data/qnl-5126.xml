These offences are committed mainly by Bedouins belonging to the Awamir, Manasir and other tribes, who are known to carry out attacks and raids along the coast of Trucial Oman.The main correspondents are the Residency Agent at Sharjah, the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. In their correspondence they discuss the reporting and investigation of individual cases and the measures that should be taken by the Ruler of Sharjah and other Trucial Coast shaikhs, to suppress kidnapping in their territories. Included in the correspondence are several witness statements made by recovered kidnapped persons, their relatives or slave masters who seek to locate and recover them. There are also extracts from the Residency Agent’s fortnightly diaries relating such incidents and several letters received by him from the Rulers of Ajman, Ras al Khaimah and Umm ul-Qaiwain about their actions to apprehend and punish the offenders and to recover the victims by force, payment of a ransom or other agreement.Most of the Residency Agent’s reports and letter correspondence, including the witness statements recorded by him at Sharjah, are in Arabic and English.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Abduction</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Slavery</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000266#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000266#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000266#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
