Krans 670. Sir, I venture to think the time has come to revise the Office Allowance sanctioned for this Consulate General in your despatch No.l of 2nd April 1928 - copy of which I beg leave to enclose for convenience uf reference. 2. I have the honour therefore to transmit herewith a revised estimate which I trust will receive your approval and sanction. 3. I beg leave to submit the following explanations for alterations in the previous estimate which I have ventured to make:- (a) Clerk Krans Nine thousand instead of Eight thousand four hundred per annum. Mr. Aratoon has now been at his post for 11 years, and certainly deserves the small rise in salary suggested. (b) Munshi Krans Eight thousand four hundred instead of Six thousand three hundred per annum . The Munshi has now been with me for over 5 years; he is particularly useful for this post, as he speaks and writes English excellently and is in ail respects most useful and reliable. I have made enquiries of the various Consulates in Persia and learn that the average salary of the various mirzas is krans six hunureo and seventy per mensem, although some of them do not possess the same language qualifications as the munshi or this Consulate General. A man of his capabalities would certainly be able to command a higher salary His Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London.s £ Krans 360. Krans 205. Krans 400. Krans 660. Krans 180. Krans 3,600. V salary ir he were to be empioyea by - say - the Anglo- persian Oil Company or the Imperial Bank of Persia. (c) The items for wimer and summer suits have been raised in accordance with last year's prices. (d) I have inserted the item of Krans three hundred and sixty for three overcoats per annum in place of the items for two overcoats, two pairs riding boots and four pairs riding breeches: the krans two hundred and five not being sufficient to cover the cost of two overcoats at the present prices and also the locally made overcoats are quite worn out in two years' time. If the proposal suggested in paragraphs 4 and 5 below be sanctioned, the riaing boots and breeches will no longer be necessary. (e) The item ''firing and lights for ghoiams at the gate krans four hundred' is in place or the krans six hundred and sixty and one hundred and eighty previously paid to the Persian guards. Since these were removed, two ghoiams have always to be on duty near the gate. Also since the installation of electric light, the illumination is much improved, but the cost has increased. 4. For the last two items for the upkeep of the four horses, I have ventured to substitute a car allowance of Krans three thousand and six hundreu. I would beg leave in this connexion to refer to my despatch No.2 of the 23 February last and to your reply to Kis Majesty's Minister, No.138 of the 26 March last (K 3o40/3640/234) T as you dia not think the reasons auduced by me sufficient to permit the sanction of the cost of a motor car, and as I still felt that the Consul-General here, ought, for reasons alreaay given, to have a car, I purchased one r myself, and I trust that you will not think that the suggested allowance for the upkeep of a car (in view of the explanation given in my above-mentioneu despatch) is excessive. This allowance would of course lapse should thethe Consul-General here decide tha.t it was unnecessary for him to keep a car. 5. If this allowance is sanctioned the proposal in paragraph 2 of my despatch h3,2 referred to above, wouxu be acted upon, and the three horses sola, ana two bicycles purchased for the gholams. 6. It will oe seen that the suggested alterations make no change in the am 'unt of the original sum sanctioned for the office allowance. 7. I am senaing this despatch Under Flying Seal to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. I have, etc., (Signed) Ernest Bristow. H.M.
