[In continuation of “ Persia, No. 5 (1912) ” : Cd. 6264.] No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 1.) Sir, Tehran, March 9, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram of tire 5th March* respecting the revenues available as security for a Persian loan, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a communication w T hich I received from the acting treasurer-general, and on which the figures given in my telegram were based. It will be observed that, apart from the receipts of the Maliat, the Persian Government at present dispose of an assured annual income of 4,000,000 tomans, of which sum 2,831,000 tomans are already absorbed by fixed charges arising from existing foreign loans and certain indispensable Government expenses. The projected loan would, of course, include the conversion of the Persian Government’s consolidated debts to the Russian Bank, the interest and sinking fund of which absorb 650,000 tomans annually. Consequently the fixed charges alluded to would be reduced by that amount, and the margin of the assured revenues available as security for the loan would thus work out at 1,819,000 tomans. A 5 per cent, loan of 33,000,000 tomans could, according to M. Mornard, be raised on this security, and, assuming that the issue price were 85 per cent., a sum of 28.050.000 tomans would be at the disposal of the Persian Government, of which 6,000,000 tomans would be required for the redemption of the debt to the Russian Bank. M. Mornard further gives a list of the floating debts of the Persian Government, including that to Messrs. Schneider, and these amount to 1,932,000 tomans. In addition to this sum, the acting treasurer-general has tabulated a sum of 700.000 tomans as representing British claims, and 1,800,000 tomans those of Russia. These figures were given to M. Mornard verbally by the two Ministers as an estimate made on the spur of the moment, and are therefore only roughly approximate. The grand total of the floating debt is therefore placed at 4,432,000 tomans, which, together with the 6 , 000,000 tomans devoted to the liquidation of the debt to the Russian Bank, may be deducted from the proceeds of the loan, and thus leave a balance to the Persian Government of about 17,600,000 tomans, exclusive of Messrs. Schneider’s claim. No mention has been made of foreign claims other than British and Russian. I have no knowledge of the claims made by the Turkish Embassy, but those put forward by the other legations would probably be covered by a sum of 500.000 tomans. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.

B4 (Translation.) THE information contained in the annexed tables shows :— 1 . That the Government at present disposes of a certain annual revenue of 40.000. 000 krans derived from the receipts of the customs, mint, telegraphs, passports, khalassehs, and excise on opium and alcohol; 2 . That a part of these revenues (28,310,000 krans) is already alienated as guarantee for foreign loans and for certain obligatory Government expenditure ; 3. That, in the event of the repayment to the Banque d’Escompte of Persia of the 60.000. 000 krans 7 per cent, debt, consolidated in 1910, the available surplus of the Government revenues would reach the figure of 40,000,000 — 21,810,000 = 18,190,000 krans; 4. That this surplus would constitute a first-class guarantee for a future loan of about 330,000,000 krans at 5 per cent., issued at a minimum price of 85 per cent., or 280,500,000 krans net ; 5. That, after repayment of the 60,000,000 krans 7 per cent, debt and of the floating debts (44,000,000 krans), a clear balance of 176,000,000 krans would remain at the disposal of the Persian Government.

Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, April 3, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to state, for the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that upon the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding the scheme prepared by Colonel Hjalmarson for the organisation of a national gendarmerie in Persia, he requested His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in a telegram, of which a copy is enclosed,f to furnish his views and those of His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, on the points raised in that communication. I am at the same time to enclose a copy of Sir G. Barclay’s answer,§ from which Lord Crewe will see that Sir P. Cox shares Sir E. Grey’s opinion that it is essential that the whole of the Bushire-Shiraz road should be dealt with from the outset, and be both financed and patrolled under Swedish supervision. He is, moreover, of opinion that any improvement on the Bushire-Shiraz road will not necessarily entail any aggravation of the situation on the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road. * See “ Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 276. f See “ Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 337. t See “Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 325. § See “ Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 335.His Lordship will further notice that the Swedish colonel himself had originally intended to include the whole of the Bushire-Shiraz road in his scheme, hut abandoned the idea from fear of accentuating the hostility of the Kashgai. Sir E. Grey thinks however, that the establishment of one post, 12 miles to the north of Shiraz, is not likely to diminish their animosity, and he would propose, subject to Lord Crewe’s concurrence, to instruct Sir G. Barclay to urge the colonel to revise his scheme by reverting to his original intention of patrolling the whole road from Shiraz to the coast, even if such a course should necessitate the abandonment of the proposed post to the north of that town. In Sir E. Grey’s opinion, it is essential at once to obtain a degree of security for British and Indian trade between Bushire and Shiraz, and sufficient to deal later with the Shiraz, Yezdikhast, and Bunder Abbas-Kerman roads. Sir E. Grey would also propose to instruct Sir G. Barclay to convey a warning to the Persian Government to the effect that, if the Khan of Borasjun proved obstructive to the gendarmerie scheme, it may become necessary for His Majesty’s Government, in view of his bad record in the past, to take forcible measures against him.

Your telegram of the 3rd April. It would not, in my opinion, serve any useful purpose to press for evacuation at the present moment. 1 feel certain that the Russian Minister would urge against it, and he would, I think, be right. The disbandment of the fedai will, I admit, probably be effected without disturbances; but the fact that the Russian troops are at Ka.zvin will be undoubtedly of assistance in ensuring the maintenance of order in this connection. Apart from the question of the fedai, I think that the force at Kazvin should not be further depleted until Salar is dealt with and Hamadan and other places cease to be threatened by his adherents. The recent action of the Russian Government with the ex-Shah has removed one of my chief objections to the presence of Russian troops at Kazvin. I objected to them in the past as the reactionaries were thereby encouraged to create incidents on bebalf of the ex-Shah ; but the ardour of the reactionaries has been damped by action of Russia against him. I also objected to the Russian troops at Kazvin because their presence diminished the prestige of the Persian Government, but the latter now depends almost entirely on the support of the two Powers, especially of Russia, for any prestige it may have. The withdrawal of the troops would encourage the extremists , 0 who are now cowed. I do not believe in the Government’s expressed desire that the troops should be withdrawn.8 No. 11.

The Minister of Finance has been making persistent attempts to nullify the functions of the treasurer-general. M. Mornard has in consequence addressed a reasoned appeal to the Cabinet, urging them to “take steps to permit treasurer-general to take in hand vigorously and promptly the reorganisation of the financial adminis tration, which has been placed provisionally under Mornard’s orders,” and complaining of the attitude adopted by the Minister of Finance. A copy of this document has been communicated to the two legations. M. Mornard informs me that he intends to follow this appeal up with a scheme of reorganisation, for which he will invoke the support of the two legations. The scheme will involve the engagement of some thirty additional Europeans ; these will doubtless be mostly Belgians. It is clear that we shall be called upon shortly to decide the question of the definitive appointment of Mornard as treasurer-general. You have doubtless furnished Sir W. Townley with your views on this subject. My own opinion of Mornard has not changed to his disfavour since my last report. No. 14. Sir G- Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Apidl 9.) Sir, Tehran, March 18, 1912. SINCE my despatch of the 17th February* the most important episodes in the insurrection have been the departure of the ex-Shah from Persian territory on the 10 th March, the recapture of Kermanshah by Salar-ed-Dowleh, and the communication which the British and Russian consuls have been instructed to make to the latter. As already reported by telegraph, the result of the negotiations conducted by the Persian Government with Mohammed Ali through the Russian consul at Astrabad, at the suggestion of the two Powers, was that the ex-Shah, finding on appeal to the Emperor that the decision of the Russian Government was final and that he could hope for no better terms than a pension for himself and an amnesty for his followers, declared his willingness to leave Persia. He asked, however, for the renewal of his former pension and for 100,000 tomans down in order to be able to pay off his followers. In these circumstances my Russian colleague and I decided to recommend the Persian * See ‘^-Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 286,Government tocompromipe by giving apension of 75,000 tomans and sncli lump sum down as was really necessary to pay off bis followers and thus avert depredations by them. With some difficulty we induced the Persian Government to consent to these terms, dhe sum reported by the Russian consul as necessary for the paying off of the ex-Shah’s followers was 70,000 tomans, and it was arranged that this sum was to be repaid to the Persian Government by the ex-Shah by annual deductions of 10,000 tomans from his pension. In their present financial straits it was impossible for the Persian Govern ment to furnish this lump sum, and it has been advanced in equal shares by His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government, to be repaid out of the impending joint advance of 200,000Z. The ex-Shah left Astrabad for the Russian naval station at Ashadura at the end of last month, and has since, on the 10th March, proceeded to Russia on board a Russian gun-boat, which had been placed at his disposal. Shoa- es-Sultaneh has remained at Astrabad to assist the the Russian consul to settle with his brother’s followers. According to latest intelligence from the Russian consul at Astrabad the paying off of these has proceeded smoothly, and the Caucasians who were in Astrabad have now r left the town. I have only fragmentary information as to the situation at Kermanshah, telegraphic communication being entirely cut off between Hamadan and Kermanshah, and the post being very irregular owing to the disorders in that district, but it appears from a private letter which has got through to me from His Majesty’s consul that Salar-ed- Dowleh, aided by Daoud Khan, chief of the Kalhors, re-entered Kermanshah on the 22nd ultimo. Most of the town is reported to have been looted. Many of the Govern ment troops are said to have been killed, and many Government officials, including Azam-ed-Dowleh, the late deputy governor, who had formerly been in bast at His Majesty’s consulate, are reported to have been hanged. On the 1st instant my Russian colleague and I instructed the two consuls to urge Salar-ed-Dowleh to accept the terms which the Persian Government offered him and to leave the country. We have so far received no reports as to the action taken on our instructions, of which I enclose a copy. At Meshed the situation is still disquieting, and the local authorities seem quite unable to deal with the disturbing royalist elements who are still in bast in large numbers at the Shrine. The Russian Minister has offered the co-operation of the Russian troops in order to break up the movement, and the Persian Government would, 1 think, be wise to accept the offer. The warnings to Shuja-ed-Dowleh at Tabriz seem at last to have produced some effect, for he ordered the cessation of certain demonstrations in the ex-Shah’s cause, which marked the early part of this month, and he has since disavowed a certain Mohammed Khan, who, with a number of horsemen, has recently occupied Zenjan, though unfortunately this brigand remains in possession of the latter town, which now that Shuja-ed-Dowleh has disavowed him he holds in the name of Salar-ed-Dowleh. The further progress of the insurrection will depend largely on the result of the joint communication of the two consuls to Salar-ed-Dowleh at Kermanshah. 1 have, &amp;c. GEORGE BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 14. Sir G. Barclay to Consul McDouall. Tehran, March 1, 1912. YOU should concert with your Russian colleague to inform Salar-ed-Dowleh jointly that, in order to put an end to the insurrection which is causing such incal culable loss to Persia, His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government have suggested to the Persian Government that latter should open negotiations with a view to the ex-Shah’s leaving the country on condition that a pension is granted him and a complete amnesty accorded to his adherents. The Persian Government have accepted the suggestion and negotiations with the ex-Shah have been proceeding through the Russian consul at Astrabad. The ex-Shah is about to leave, and there only remain to be settled matters connected with his pension. Persian Government now offer Salar-ed-Dowleh a pension of 6,000 tomans for himself and 6,000 tomans for his family, and the revocation of the confiscation of his estates, on condition that he maintains order at Kermanshah and the places in his [1340] C10 occupation, hands them over to a governor appointed by the Persian Government and then leaves Persia with an undertaking not to return to the country without the previous consent of the Persian Government. The two legations strongly advise Salar-ed-Dowleh to accept the proposal of the Persian Government and to leave Persia on the above-mentioned conditions. No. 15. Sir G.

ON the 16th instant, in pursuance of instructions of our Governments, my Russian colleague and I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs verbally that the two Powers were not opposed to the engagement of officers for the army from subjects of the minor Powers, and we also informed him, with reference to a communication which had been made to the Russian Government by the Persian Minister at St. Petersburgh, who had mentioned the apprehensions of the Persian Government lest the two Powers should seek to limit the strength of the new army, that the two Powers had no such intention, as, in their opinion, Persia needed a much larger army than her means would allow her to create and maintain. Although my instructions said nothing expressly to warrant my joining in the latter part of this communication, I saw no objection in doing so. I must not omit to report that, after making this joint communi cation, M. Poklewsky added that the declaration regarding the engagement of officers from the minor Powers did not apply to the Cossack Brigade, the organisation of which, if the brigade was increased, must remain on the same lines as heretofore. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 16. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 9.) Sir, Tehran, March 18, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 16. Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending March 18. Tehran. Anglo-Russian Note of the ISth February. —Negotiations have been in progress during the past four weeks between the Persian Government and the two legations respecting the Persian Government’s reply to the joint note. The Cabinet. —Samsam-es-Sultaneh is still Prime Minister, and though Yossuk-ed- Dowleh, the Foreign Minister, tendered his resignation to the Regent on the 11 th March, and the Prime Minister resigned the following day, the resignations were withdrawn soon after. General ^Situation.- —The situation at Tehran continues to be quiet, but the provinces, as will be seen from the provincial section of this summary, are even in a more disturbed condition than usual. The departure of the ex-Shah has brought about a considerable detente in the north, but the continued activity of Salar-ed-Dowleh gives much anxiety to the Government. Prince Farman Farma, who spent several months in the vicinity of Kazvin, finding himself unable to reach his post at Kermanshah, has returned to Tehran, and it is the intention ©f the Government to send him to his post accompanied by a force of Persian Cossacks..11 [1340] C 2 Sipahdar has not yet been definitely nominated Governor-General of Azerbaijan, but it is known that the appointment wonld be agreeable to the Russian Legation. Endeavours are, however, being made to bring about a change of Cabinet, with Sipahdar as Prime Minister. It is generally thought that rumours to this effect brought about the Cabinet resignations reported above. Tabriz. On the 5th March there was some excitement in the city due to the hoisting of several flags bearing the inscription “ Long Life to Mohammed Ali Shah,” but on repre sentations being made to Shuja-ed-Dowleh by the British and Russian consular authorities all the flags were removed on the following day. Since the above episode there have been no further demonstrations in favour of the ex-Shah. Early in March 1,500 Russian troops left Tabriz and 1,000 arrived. According to the Russian consul-general, there are some 3,000 troops in Tabriz, and about 500 on the Tabriz-Julfa road. Ispahan. Sardar Zafar, the new governor of the province, arrived on the 25th February. Naib Hussein, who has so long been a disturber of the peace in the Kashan district, has at last made his peace with the Persian Government, and has been appointed Governor of Natanz. Under instructions from the Central Government, Mirza Assadullah Khan, the ex-Government Treasury agent, who has been plotting incessantly against Mr. Haycock, was sent under a guard to Tehran on the 29th February. Mr. Moir, British vice-consul and Messrs. Ziegler’s manager at Sultanabad, was robbed by Bakhtiaris at Hassanabad on the 18th March while on his way to his post. Shiraz. On the 28th February a squadron of the 39th Central India Horse, when exercising about six miles from Shiraz, was fired on. The fire was not returned, and the officer commanding the squadron managed to get into communication with the riflemen, who said that they had mistaken the sowars for robbers, and expressed their regret at the mistake. * On further enquiries being made, His Majesty’s consul satisfied himself that the incident was really the result of a mistake. Mr. Acting Consul Knox left on the 29th February. On the 2nd March a party of 130 gendarmes, under three Swedish officers, left Tehran for Shiraz. The gendarmes are to form a nucleus for the Ears Battalion, which is to be raised for the protection of the Bushire-Shiraz-Yezdikhast road. Seistan. There have been no political disturbances, and, with the exception of Baluchi raids in the Kainat, all has remained quiet in the province. Kerman. Amir-i-Azam has continued in his policy of discouraging anti-foreign demon strations. Rifat-ed-Dowleh has been appointed Governor of Bam. There has been considerable unrest in commercial circles owing to the numerous failures of business firms. Kermanshah. On the 8 th February a Government force under Yar Mohammed arrived and took the town. Salar-ed-Dowleh fled, and Azam-ed-Dowleh left the consulate where he had been a refugee since the 15th December, and again took over the governorship of the town. On the 22nd February, Salar-ed-Dowleh recaptured Kermanshah, took Azam-ed- Dowleh prisoner and had him executed, and gave the town over to his followers to plunder. Yar Mohammed, the leader of the Government force, managed to escape.12 A sowar of the consular escort was deliberately wounded by one of the followers of Salar-ed-Dowleh. The latter, on hearing of this, sent an apology and a cheque for 200 tomans to the sowar, but His Majesty’s consul ordered the cheque to be returned, and informed Salar-ed-Dowleh that the matter was too serious for him to accept a compromise. Owing to Yar Moharfimed’s defeat, Farman Farma, the newly-appointed governor, who w r as on his way to Kermanshah, returned to Tehran. The Minister for foreign Affairs states that Farman Farma will shortly leave for Kermanshah with a force of Persian Cossacks. Zen'] an. On the 13th March, Mohammed Khan, a brigand, entered the town with a number of horsemen, having promised submission to the governor. The governor telegraphed to Tehran that he was very pleased to report Mohammed Khan’s submission, and the Minister of the Interior asked the Regent to confer a title upon him. Shortly after wards the brigand, who was in collusion with a local notable, seized and imprisoned the governor and asked Shuja-ed-Dowleh what he was to do with him. Shuja-ed- Howleh replied that he was to be set at liberty, and this was done, but Mohammed Khan remains in possession of the town which he holds in the name of Salar-ed-Dowleh. Lingah. In February the tribesmen of the Tarakumah district, owing to the capture of a large consignment of arms destined for them, commenced raising a force to attack the customs and British consulate at Lingah. A force, estimated at 2,400 tribesmen, was reported to be some sixty miles from Lingah on the 12th March. Asa general advance on the town appeared imminent, and as the local authorities were unable to offer any resistance to the raiders, 150 men of the 7th Rajputs were brought from Jask and landed at Lingah on the 12th March for the protection of British lives and property. No. 17. India Office to Foreign Office. — (Received, April 9.) Sir, India Office, April 6 , 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, on the subject of the scheme prepared by Colonel lljalmarson for the organisation of a national gendarmerie in Persia, and in reply to say th&amp;t he concurs in the instructions which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposes to send to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. He would, however, venture to suggest—while recognising that it would be useless to press for protective measures at the present juncture on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road—that the necessity for restoring order there at the earliest possible date should be kept steadily before the Persian Government. As Sir E. Grey is aware, many representations on this subject have been made by Indian firms, and as the Kerman road (unlike the Shiraz road) is within the British sphere it would seem to have an especial claim to the attention of His Majesty’s Government. I am, &amp;c. LIONEL ABRAHAMS. No. 18. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Fhoard Grey.—(Received April 9.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 9, 1912. RECENILY Regent has repeatedly complained of his state of health. My Russian colleague and I waited upon his Highness this afternoon to discuss question. His Highness said that he had had two attacks of angina pectoris in the last few days, that he was suffering from insomnia, that his nerves had broken down under the* See “Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 335. continuous strain of his work, and that his doctor had ordered him rest. W e expressed our misgivings at the prospect of his departure in view of unsettled situation, but he said that it was imperative for him to take a cure, and that he intended to leave in the middle of May, returning in September. He hoped after his cure to be able to have an exchange of ’views with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs and with you. He said that he would delegate his powers to Cabinet, retaining right to sign decrees, which he could exercise in case of urgency by telegram. He thought that his advice from abroad would be readily followed by the Cabinet, that a temporary absence would take off edge of the intrigues against him, and that he would be able to return with renewed influence. His Highness assured us that he would return, and that when abroad he would keep in touch with the two Governments. In view of above we think that it would be inadvisable to press Regent further to forgo his holiday, to which his Highness says Cabinet have consented. No. 19. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received April 11.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, April 10, 1912. SIR G. BARCLAY’S telegram of yesterday. As M. Sazonof had not received' news of the intention of the Regent to leave Persia, I communicated substance of above telegram to him. The Regent would, His Excellency said, in all probability never return if once he left the country. He did not see, however, how we could prevent his going, though it was much to be regretted, as we were on the eve of important discussions on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway, loan, army, and other questions. M. Sazonofs language with regard to the situation was somewhat despondent. Matters had not improved, although the ex-Shah had been disposed of, and the state of affairs was serious, especially at Kermanshah. M. Sazonof stated that, as a result of disturbances which were connected indirectly with Salar-ed-Dowleh, the Russian Government were sending a sotnia of Cossacks to Hamadan from Ivazvin. No. 20. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 11.) (Telegraphic.) _ Tehran, April 11, 1912. THREE Swedish officers reached Shiraz 5th April. No. 21. Sir Edivard Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) • Foreign Office, April 11, 1912. YOUR telegram of the 30th March* : Gendarmerie. His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the question, and have come to the conclusion that the most pressing need is for some security for British and Indian trade on the road between Shiraz and Bushire. It is therefore desirable that the colonel should revert to his original idea of patrolling the whole of this road, and you should urge him to revise his last scheme to this extent, even if the proposal to establish a post north of Shiraz should have to be temporarily abandoned in consequence. If the proper execution of the gendarmerie scheme is obstructed by the Khan of Borasjun, His Majesty’s Government may find themselves compelled to take forcible measures against him. You should so warn the Persian Government, calling attention to the khan’s bad record in the past.We recognise that the present moment is not suitable for urging the Persian Government to take measures to protect the road between Bunder Abbas and Kerman. We are, however, bound to devote special attention to this road, which lies within our sphere, and to require that order shall be restored on it as soon as may be, and you should see that the Persian Government do not allow this question to escape their attention. No. 22. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 12.) Sir, Tehran, March 25, 1912. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a diary compiled by Eis Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah. showing briefly the position of affairs at that place from the 16th February to the end of the month. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 22. Kermanshah Consulate Diary from February 16 to 29, 1912. SALAR-ED-EOW LEE on leaving Kermanshah went to Mahidasht and remained there two days. Ee then sent his wife to the Kalhur country, and with Sardar Muzaffir and the town Khans moved to the Crown lands, which extend from 7 to about 15 miles to north-west of town. They robbed all villages in the neighbourhood, and sent messengers in all directions to call forces. The town was in perfect order, and the general and commission occupied in regulating affairs and fortifying the town. 2 . On the 17th a letter arrived from Salar-ed-Dowleh through the Russian consul, saying he was going to besiege the town, and consuls and foreign subjects should withdraw to villages till he had punished the unruly. A man from his camp asserted that the rebels ascribed their defeat to the presence of officials in the British consulate, and say that if allowed to destroy the consulate they can take the town. He also declared that the Prince had promised them the loot of the consulate and the bank. The road to Kangawar was held by Kakawand, and no messengers were able to get through. Two from consulate returned wounded, and one of them died, 3. Ettila-ed-Dowleh became president of court-martial and rais kashun, as well as president of special commission. Gates were erected in several places, and messengers sent to Farman Farma to send reinforcements. Various chiefs, including Sardar Akram, wrote to the authorities that they submitted to Government. Things promised v T ell in expectation of the arrival of Farmari Farma, but no news coming from him, the adherents of Salar-ed-Dowleh believed he was not coming, and they had only a small force to deal with, and those who had accepted service with the Government were prepared to desert or assist the rebels. 4. Mujallal-es-Sultan, on behalf of Mohammed Aii Mirza, joined Salar-ed-Dowleh with fifty horsemen and many Kurdistanis (Jaf Juwanrudi) eager to avenge their chief, Sharaf-el-Mulk, as well as the local tribesmen of the province under orders of Sardar Muzaffir. On the 18th there was skirmishing outside the town, one local volunteer was killed, and several on the rebel side. 5. On night of the 21 st there was some firing on the west of the town, where sangars were held by town volunteers with a small backing of mujahids. At sunrise the volunteers joined the rebels, who then occupied the Chia Surkh, a hill suburb of Kermanshah. Advancing thence, they occupied about one-third of the bazaar, when they were attacked and driven back with loss by a body of fifty mujahids, who held a sangar after wards till next morning. The rebels, who consisted of Kurdistanis, Sinjabis, and town Khans, then entered the town at other points, and by 9 p.m. the greater part of the town was in their hands. The officials and Yar Mohammed then evacuated the palace and fled towards Dinawar with several loads of ammunition. At least 400 had been killed on both sides. 6 . In the afternoon some Kakawand sowars were in the valley behind the consulate, but on learning the consulate was in front of them left. Five Kalhurs passed, and being told this was the consulate their leader said they had orders torespect the consulate from Sardar Muzaffir, and there was nothing to fear, a man behind then put up his rifle and shot an Indian sowar of the escort through the arm, declaring he was a mujahid. They then went on. 7. On the 23rd Salar-ed-Dowleh and Sardar Muzafiir went to the palace. The latter had, it is said, been given a free hand. As soon as the Kalhurs, who had taken little part in the fighting, arrived they 4oegan looting. One of the first houses plundered was that of the dragoman of the Russian consulate, who had a Russian flag flying. An Indian ferrash of this consulate was also robbed of all his goods ; there was a flag on the house. Two sowars of the Turkish consular escort were stripped in the street. General looting took place, only the caravanserai of Wekil-ed-Dowleh, where many British goods were stored, escaped and the “ bczzaz khane,” but in the latter there were few goods, most of the shopkeepers having taken them to their houses for safety. Ail caravanserais in the outskirts of the town were looted, including goods owned by Manchester merchants in transit to Hamadan. Particulars not yet known. They searched everywhere for mujahids and several were arrested. On the 25th the Ilkhani (Salar Humayun, head of town Kalhurs) was, with his son Fath-el-Ayaleh, indefatigable in trying to stop the plundering, and certainly saved the office of Messrs. Ziegler and some others. Mnjallal-es-Sultan abused Sardar Muzafflr, and told him that this plundering would ruin their cause and threatened to leave, hut was persuaded by Salar-ed-Dowleh to remain. 8 . On the 23rd, Ettila-ed-Dowleh was discovered with two mujahids and executed next day, the body being barbarously exposed. Several mujahids were also executed. On the 25th it was reported that Azam-ed-Dowleh had been captured, and the three consulates sent their munshis to intercede for his life. Salar-ed-Dowleh said it was not in his power to save him. It turned out that he had not been captured, but thirty- four others of the garrison, who had escaped, were brought in and twenty executed. Others who were executed were three or four officers of mujahidin. On the 27th Azam-ed-Dowleh was brought in and with his son and two others hanged. They' were captured near Kenduleh in the Dinawar district. There is no reliable news of Yar Mohammed Khan and the rest of his force. 9. Salar-ed-Dowleh has sent a force to occupy Sahna and Kangawar, and is giving out that he will advance on Hamadan in a few days. w. McDouall. No. 23. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 12.) Sir, Tehran, March 29, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram of the 25th instant, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman- shah, reporting the refusal of Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh to accept the terms of the Persian Government as communicated to him by the British and Russian consuls at that place. My Russian colleague and I are to-day addressing instructions to the two consuls to make a further and stronger communication to the Prince, of which I enclose a copy. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 23. Consul McDouall to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Kermanshah, March 15, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that with my Russian colleague I called on Salar- ed-Dowleh, and we read him a translation of the identical telegram of the 2 nd March from the two legations, and pointed out that the two legations strongly advise him to accept. He would not accept, but made other proposals embodied in a long letter which I enclose in original with translation. His letter was not received till the 14th. On its receipt my Russian colleague came to me and we sent a message advising him16 to make a more reasonable proposal. He replied no doubt they would make alterations in Tehran. He would not alter it here at present. Amir Jang is the Yali of Pusht-i-kuh ; the statement that he and the other chiefs are preparing to move is, I believe, imaginary, and probably only means that the Prince has asked them to do so. The Prince has only about 500 men in Kermansbah at present. I have, &amp;c. W. McDOUALL. Enclosure 2 in No. 23. Salar-ed-Dowleh to Consul McDouall. (Translation.) YESTERDAY with M. Nicolsky, Russian consul, you stated the contents of a telegram from Tehran. Although I gave the necessary answer verbally at the time, yet I write this summary, which you will agree to telegraph. First, you stated that His Majesty Mohammed Ali Shah, the natural and glorious King, had agreed to leave Persia. Although order to this effect has not been issued to me, yet it is necessary for me to write. After I had undergone for four years every kind of adversity and trouble and loss and imprisonment and exile from my fatherland, having spent two and a-half years in Europe in great straits, I constantly stated my case to the Persian Government and received no reply. They did not even pay me what was due as arranged through the Russian Government. To settle the business I went to London and stayed at the Persian Legation, and stated my case to the late Regent Azad-el-Mulk. He replied, “ What is necessary for your case in Europe will be arranged ” They did nothing. This is a small matter ; they have confiscated all my property without reason; as all my estates are pledged to the Banque d’Escomptes for 150,000 tomans and interest borrowed through Arbab Jamshid, and my receipt is there. The estates wTiich my Royal father bequeathed me they have seized. They have given Eshratabad on lease, and confiscated Mardabad, and have not given me what was due to me. They have also seized the revenues of my purchased estates ; my family were in such straits that they had to sell their house furniture to live. This is concealed from no one. A telegram came from Sattar Khan and Bagir Khan that it is necessary that you come to Persia to end the disorders, and plainly called me in this language: “The people approve your coming, and will esteem it a favour.” I came to Resht, and they imprisoned me for two days ; however much I implored them to take me to Tehran in that state, and let me remain there two days, and after making arrangements for my family I would leave Persia, they did not agree. After my return from Persia I promised Ilis Majesty Mohammed Ali Shah and swore to him that as long as His Majesty wished for the rights of his ancestors I would not fail in his service to spend my last breath. Provided that Mohammed Ali Shah is in Persia, I have no opinion of my own whatever. I and the 3,000,000 people of these provinces will not fail in carrying out his desires to the last drop of our blood. What is said to me must be said to him ; I am only in reference to him an unworthy subject. But if His Majesty Mohammed Ali Shah is willing to give up his personal rights my promises to him are void, and I consider myself entitled to the rights of my forefathers. Your state ment that with regard to me the Persian Government had proposed to the two legations that a sum of 6,000 tomans for myself and a like sum for my family be granted, that I should sell the graves of my ancestors for this price, and that the confiscation of my estates should be annulled. Under the circumstances, I write this reply, that all the world may know that I have no personal spite, and undertook this trouble to put an end to the confusion and disorder of the last four years, which has been caused by the incapability of the Persian Government. Firstly, if the remaining one of seven Kings is to become a beggar, he will earn more than this. Secondly, when in Europe this was my charge to my friends there : if I die in Europe, take my body and bury in the soil of my beloved native land. Ear be it that I should go alive from this soil. As before stated, if Mohammed Ali Shah does not want his rights, I consider myself entitled to take them ; but to-day, for certain reasons, I put aside the taking of the rights of my forefathers to show all the world the last scene in this sad drama. Therefore, that I be not suspected of causing a continuance of this civil war and destruction of a 6 , 000 -year old State and the desolation of Persia, I will cease from war and obey, provided that the Persian Government accepts the under mentioned conditions through the Ministers of the two Powers.countries in my occupation as below be under my rule, and the sovereignty of t e King of the Kajar dynasty for the time being (Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, and Oarus, the mines of Upper and Lower Tarem), which by concession of Muzaffir-ed-Din bhah were granted to Amanianz the Christian, and by zeal of the Foreign Office and . 0 ?^ Azam transferred to me with the villages (of Azariad and Anguran) situated m Zmjan, where I have property (Hamadan, Kermanshah and neighbourhood, Kangawar and^ Assadavad, Burujird, Luristan, and Arabistan, the three districts of Kamara, Gulpaigan, Khunsar, the three districts of Malavir, Sultanabad, Irak). The above districts, which were and are in my possession, are my home, and all my wives are the children of the chiefs of these countries, and my estates are situated in them. Some of these countries are necessary for the preservation of order in the others. It is known geneially to all the world, and to Great Britain in particular, that Persia is powerless to preserve order in these countries, especially in Burujird, Luristan, and Kermanshah ; no one but myself has the power to hold these countries and collect the revenue and repel the criminal. If accepted, I will promise to agree to the orders of the King ffi* Peisia as far as they do not interfere with the order of the country m my occupation. After this agreement has been made and the expenses of the amount of troops that I can raise for the protection of these countries, and the expenses of civil government paid, I will pay the remainder of the revenue and other receipts into the King’s Treasury in two instalments yearly. Orders to me to be issued only by His Majesty. The damage which has been done to me in these four years and to my dependants, and the persons who caused this damage to me and took my property to be handed to me, according to a list which I will give, by the Persian Government. No official of the Persian Government is to come to these countries unless with my concurrence and agreement. They shall give no orders unless in a matter which concerns me personally. In all matters, civil and military, without any exception of these countries, I am personally answerable to His Majesty. From the date of signature of this agreement, if Persia makes any agreement with any European Power whatever concerning these countries it must be with my knowledge and consent ; otherwise the people of these countries will have the right of acceptance or refusal ; in the event of refusal by the people of these countries they will not be responsible for any loss or damage to that Power. ^ For the repair ol the damage of these four years, the restoration of what has been ruined, and for making guardhouses on the highways and roads and organising a gendarmerie, and repair of Government buildings in these countries which are all laid waste, and for assistance to the rayats of the estates which are ruined—perhaps to-dav there is no vestige of them—the Government of Persia after approval must give the money either from the Treasury or by borrowing on terms approved by Persia from the two Powers. Whenever money is required it is to be arranged as above. I will buy what arms are necessary and sufficient for protection of these countries, because to-day the Government arms do not exist, and countries cannot be held by the arms of the tribes, and revenue will not be collected, and order and peace will not be arranged, and things will remain as they are. With the consent of the two Powers teachers for agriculture, commerce, colleges and army will be engaged from abroad, and I myself will summon them and make arrangements with them; this is my personal business and wish, and after it will be reported to the King. I will be satisfied when the agreement is signed and guaranteed by the two Powers. Should the Persian Government at any time by a trick stretch out its hand and cause disorder to the people of these countries, the Powers to be judges. Should these conditions of mine be accepted I undertake to render obedience to my King, Sultan Ahmed Shah. Further, should he require service from me temporarily in any other place I am ready to carry it out—obedience to the King is imperative. After signature of the agree ment the Persian Government to give me without delay official permission with full powers to treat with Turkey regarding the land from Baneh to Katr, which without right they have seized and occupied, and to take the necessary steps, with the cognisance of the Persian Government, to obtain the evacuation of that district. Should the Government of Persia not accept this agreement the two Powers, with that kindness and generosity to Persia that they have always shown just as at the time when Mohammed Ali and myself came to Persia they decided to be neutral, and informed the Persian Government officially of this, at this time when I am ready with all my power to recover my rights being neutral, I and this honourable people will be content. All this is provided that Mohammed Ali Shah is not in Persia, and has resigned his rights otherwise. I am only one of his subjects faithful to His Majesty, and have no opinion of my own. I beg that a reply, in affirmative or negative, may be [1340] D18 obtained from the Persian Government without delay or procrastination, because that Amir Jang and all the chiefs of these countries are ready fc&gt; move with their forces, and I myself on the 5 th of next month (25th March), if these conditions are not accepted, will be obliged to move and send an army and finish my business if war is to continue. SALAP-ED-DOWLEH. Enclosure 3 in No. 23. Sir G. Barclay to Consul McDouall. (Telegraphic.) &lt; Tehran, March 30, 1912. YOU should, in concert with your Russian colleague, urge Salar most strongly to hand over the provinces occupied by him to Farman Farma, who is appointed governor of that part of Persia, and to leave Persia. You should inform Salar that his proposal is inacceptable, and that his longer stay in Persia is destructive of peace and contrary to the interests of the two Powers. Consequently, Persian Government have their full sympathy and support in the action they are taking against him. Persian Government are preparing a strong force against him, and they have means for the purpose, as they have received a considerable pecuniary advance from the two Powers. If Salar refuses to follow 7 this strong advice, you should tell him that he will forfeit all chance of assistance from the two Pov 7 ers to obtain for him a pension and all chance of protection from them in future. No. 24. Mr. A. Young to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 12, 1912. KEKMANSHAH and Salar-ed-Dowleh. Your telegram of 28th March.* I have just received the following telegram, dated the 6 th April, from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah :— “ My Russian colleague and I to-day visited Salar-ed-Dowleh, and, in pursuance of the instructions contained in your telegram of 80 th March, urged him to accept the terms offered to him. He refused, however, and added that this reply to his telegram set him free to proclaim himself Shah. As a patriot and Mahometan leader his object vms to bring about the restoration of order and religion and to create a strong Government.” I defer observations until Russian Minister receives the reply from his consul, when they can be made jointly. His Maiesty’s consul at Kermanshah also telegraphs under date of 7 th April as follows :— “ Prince Salar-ed-Dovdeh has left Kermanshah for Kalhur in order to see the chiefs and collect men. He thinks the vali will also come, but 1 doubt this. Salar’s force will increase with every delay on the part of the Persian Government in taking action. “ I informed the Sinjabi chief of the contents of the communication from the legation to Salar. He said he wmuld undertake to deal with the Kalhurs if Farman Farma came personally immediately with 300 men and guns ; the tribes would, he said, be forced otherwise to join Salar-ed-Dowleh.” Farman Farma has arrived as far as Kazvin; I will press the Persian Government to hasten his journey and to strengthen his forces. He himself is confident that he can eject Salar from Kermanshah with the forces now at his disposal, and also by negotiating with the Sinjabis. * See “ Persia, No, 5 (1912),” No. 333,Sir Edward Grey to Mr. A. Young. No. 26. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 13.) M. Sazonof thinks that His Highness is anxious to leave Persia'altoo-ether. While agreeing, however, that nothing can be done to prevent his departure, M. Sazonof has sent instructions^ to M. Poklewsky to lay before the Regent reasons why it would be desirable that His Highness should not leave at the present moment. The news just received from Kermanshah of the intention of Salar-ed-Dowleh to proclaim himself Shah has much perturbed his Excellency. Russian consul at Kermanshah has now reported similar reply from Salar-ed-Dowleh.

Your telegram of the 12 th April. We must, when giving instructions to the bank, define what the surplus of the southern customs means. There are certain quasi-fixed charges necessary to the good administration of the country over and above the service of the Anglo-Indian loans and the bank loan of last year. No formal tabulation has ever been made of these charges, but I presume you would not desire to see them interfered with.

(Telegraphic.) Beters~burgh, Aprtl 15, 1912. I SAW M. Sazonof this afternoon. His Excellency told me that he feared that the force under Farman Farma would be too weak to defeat Salar-ed-Dowleh, but that M. Poklewsky had been instructed to support the representations of his British colleague at Tehran (see your telegram of the 13th instant). _ The Minister for Foreign Affairs then turned to the situation at Tabriz, and on this subject he spoke very pessimistically. About 900 fedais had arrived immediately after the announcement of Sipahdar’s appointment. Shuja-ed-Dowleh w^as the only man who was capable of maintaining order, and his Excellency blamed himself with having made a serious mistake when, out of a desire to conciliate the Persian Govern ment, he had agreed to his removal. Now that the ex-Shah had left Persia he was co-operating with the Government, though formerly he had been considered a partisan of Mohammed Ali. If disorders, like those which had broken out in last December, were created by Sipahdar’s friends, the fedais, the assumption of the administration of Northern Azerbaijan would be the only course to which the Imperial Government could resort. I pointed out to M. Sazonof that there must be enough Russian troops at Tabriz to render the outbreak of disorders of this description impossible, and I begged his Excellency not to think of taking over the administration. M. Sazonof replied that if there were a recurrence of these disturbances even he would advocate this course, and he doubted the Russian troops being strong enough to quell them. To persuade the Persian Government to keep Sipahdar in the capital and to allow Shuja to exercise the functions of Governor-General of Tabriz, even though they belonged nominally to Sipahdar, seemed to his Excellency to be the only other alternative. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he would w r ait until he received further news from the acting Russian consul at Tabriz, and if he found it necessary to ask the Persian Government to keep Shuja there he would instruct Count Benckendorff to request you to support M. Poklewsky’s representations. No. 32. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. A. Young. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 15, 1912.

I have received the following telegram from His Majesty’s acting consul at Tabriz :— “ It would appear that the Russian Government have been wholly misinformed. A few fedais who were in hiding ventured out some time ago, but none have .arrived ; except for four or five leaders in bast at the Turkish consulate-general, who have been seen in the town accompanied by a gholam of the Turkish consulate, no other leaders are here. “ In my opinion, the pessimistic views and apprehensions of the Russian Govern ment are absolutely unfounded ; not a soul will ever dare to move here. After the recent occurrences it is, of course, possible that disturbances may be created, especially when a man like Shuja-ed-Dowleh is here. The latter resents the appointment of Sipahdar as Governor-General of the province ; he identities him with the Caucasian revolutionaries, and fears he will lose the support of the chiefs of the tribes, Russian sympathy, and, above all, a lucrative post. When he was told that the Sipahdar’s appointment had been approved by the Russian Government he announced his willing ness to retire to Maragha. He is under obligations to Russia.” The Russian Minister has no information respecting the alleged 900 fedais. Acting Russian consul has merely reported similar cases to those mentioned by Mr. Stevens. The Russian Minister states that these could be dealt with by the Russian troops now at Tabriz at any moment. The Persian Government also know nothing of the 900 fedais. The acting Russian consul has reported Shuja’s discontent end certain fictitious allegations against the Sipahdar. In reply he has just been instructed by the Russian Minister to use severe language to Shuja, and to tell him that he must remain loyal to the Persian Government, with whom, by the instrumentality of Russia, he has made peace on favourable terms. If he cannot remain loyal he must leave Persia, and Russia will have nothing more to do with him. When the Sipahdar was appointed Governor-General he offered Shuja the post of Governor of Maragha and other districts ; it is, however, clear that Shuja has not been co-operating with the Central Government, and he has also declined to send any reports to the Sipahdar in Tehran. * I No. 41. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 18.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, April 18, 1912. PLEASE refer to your telegram of the 16th April. I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning, and his Excellency reverted to what you had said in your telegram above mentioned, substance of which I communi cated to him in a private letter yesterday. M. Sazonof said that the Russian Government would be compelled, in self-defence, to take over the administration of Northern Azerbaijan if the fedais were to make treacherous attacks on the Russian troops, as they did last December. He said that he had only spoken to me in order to warn you that this would be so, and that he had24 not yet spoken to any of his colleagues on the subject. If the Persian Government would leave Shuja at Tabriz as deputy governor it might he possible to avoid having recourse to such a step altogether, and his Excellency assured me that he would only take it in the very last resort. He begged me to tell you that he would be grateful of British support at Tehran in inducing Persian Government to leave Shuja at Tabriz. No. 42. Sir G.

Shuja-ed-Dowleh has sent a satisfactory reply in answer to the acting Russian consul’s remonstrances. He professes to be ready to follow the advice of the Russian Minister and to be loyal to the Central Government. He hopes the Sipahdar will hasten his arrival, but consents to continue to act as deputy governor until his arrival.

The British and Russian consuls enquire what attitude they should assume in this event. My Russian colleague suggests that we should instruct them that, if Salar takes this step, they should continue to behave towards him as at present, but at the same time to avoid, as far as may be possible, any personal intercourse with him. No. 46. Sir W. 'Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 20.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 20, 1912. ADVANCE to Persian Government. Mr. Young’s telegram of the 14th April. Acting treasurer-general represents that, with the exception of that portion of the[1340] E credit of d 00 , 000 L advanced two months ago which has been pnt aside for specific purposes, such as the purchase of arms and ammunition in Europe, the maintenance of the gendarmerie for four or five months, and of the police of Tehran for three months, the sum advanced will be completely exhausted by the end of the present month. He has therefore made an official request to the two legations for a further advance of 50,000£. to the Persian Government by the British and Russian Governments, or by the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Russian Bank. The Russian Minister suggests that, if the two Governments consent to make a further advance, provision should be made for 100 , 000 L ; he thinks that the sum which M. Mornard has named is too small to meet the expenses that must necessarily be incurred on account of the expedition against Salar-ed-Dowleh and for other purposes. He thinks that a further irritating request for money will be inevitable if the smaller sum only is advanced. He suggests that the Persian Government should not be made aware that the larger sum has been put at their disposal. The loan negotiations may have been completed by the autumn, and he thinks that the larger sum held in reserve should be sufficient to enable the Persian Government to tide over their present financial difficulties until then.

My Russian colleague informs me that the latest news which he has received regarding the situation at Tabriz is of a most satisfactory nature.

Russia could count on the friendly disposition of Sipahdar, but the present situation required a stronger man, such as Shuja, who inspired confidence. M. Sazonof said, however, that he did not intend, to urge the Persian Government to postpone Sipahdar’s departure from Tehran. No. 49. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 20.)

Casualties were two Russians wounded, eight Persians killed. Though it is not yet known which side began the fight, the cause of it seems to have been that the natives of Talish refused to accept the son of Sardar Amjad as governor ; the Russian consul was supporting this man’s candidature. “ During the fight the Russian gun-boat, which had left Enzeli some days before, bombarded the coast of Talish at the bazaar of Alam. “ The Russians have only 150 Cossacks at Kerganrnd ; remainder are still in Enzeli. dhey have telegraphed to Ardebil and Astara for reinforcements.” I have spoken to my Russian colleague on the subject. He says that robber bands have been inflicting serious losses on Russian subjects, and that the object of the expedition was to punish these and establish Persian authority as governor. Russian consul at Resht has gone to the scene of action, but he had not heard that reinforcements had been summoned. He puts the Persian casualties at over twenty. No. 53.

The Sipahdar is personally not at all desirous of proceeding to Tabriz. My Russian colleague, however, is of the opinion that it would be difficult for him now to suggest that he should not go there. He tells me that the pressure which he has been exerting on Shuja has had the effect of bringing that individual into line, and that his attitude towards the Sipahdar is now loyal and correct. If the latter assumes the office of Governor-General it will be considered here as tantamount to a resumption of Persian authority over Azerbaijan. No opinion either in favour of Sipahdar or Shuja or the reverse has ever been expressed by His Majesty’s Legation. No. 55. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 23.) (Telegraphic.)

I have received thefollowing telegram from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman, dated yesterday :— “ Complete confusion reigns at the present time in the affairs of this province. The Governor-General had sent out Mirza Hussein Khan to collect revenue in certain districts ; a large force and some guns accompanied him. He has, however, joined the principal local khans of Jiruft and Rudbar, who refused to pay taxes. The Governor- General’s ferrash bashi, who was busy collecting revenue, has been robbed and imprisoned, and the khans are reported to be marching on Kerman, their avowed object being to expel the Governor-General and to loot the town. It is reported that the Affshars and Buchakchis are making common cause with them. I have hopes that such an ill-assorted crew will quarrel among themselves before reaching Kerman, and I personally doubt whether in any case they will dare to attack the town, but this belief is not shared by people here, who are in no little alarm. Most of the regular troops have deserted for want of pay, and the best of them are with Mirza Hussein Khan, so that the Governor-General has hardly any force wherewith to repel an attack should one be made. “ I hardly think the rebels will trouble me, but Europeans living near to the town might be robbed or molested.” I am to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs to-morrow and will speak to his Excellency on this subject.

His own opinion is that His Highness ought certainly to stay in the country until the question of Salar-ed-Dovvleh has been disposed of. Though the Persian Government appear confident that they will have little difficulty in expelling Salar from Kermanshah, and loyal forces seem to be rallying to Farman Farma, who has now arrived at Hamadan, the Russian Minister thinks the task may prove a more serious matter than anticipated.

An enquiry is being conducted by British consular officers with a view to establishing conflicting interests at Shuster of the sheikh and the Bakhtiaris. His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, who is now at Ahwaz with the resident at Bushire, and who has recently visited Shuster, reports by telegraph that that place has been attacked by Bakhtiaris, who have declined to await the result of the mediatory enquiry. Major Haworth fears that the quarrel may develop into a conflict in which British interests may suffer serious damage. He reports that the attitude of the sheikh has been perfectly correct throughout the whole trouble, and represents that he is entitled to the full support of His Majesty’s Government. I have brought the matter to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and also to that of the Bakhtiari khans, who hold a prominent position here in the govern ment of the country. The latter profess their willingness to await the result of the consul’s enquiry, and say that they sincerely desire to find a modus vivendi.

Some Shahsevan tribesmen attacked and surrounded a small Cossack detachment on its way to Ardebil. The enemy greatly outnumbered the Cossacks, but the officer in command succeeded in warding them off until reinforcements came up to his relief. An attack was then made on the tribesmen by the combined Russian force. Russian casualties were one officer and two men killed and eight men wounded.

His Highness informed me that the Sheikh of Mohammerah had telegraphed to him complaining of the attitude of the Bakhtiaris, and stating that he was forced to take up arms on behalf of his people, whom the Bakhtiaris were threatening to dispossess of their property. His Highness admitted that the sheikh’s telegram was couched in most loyal terms. The Regent tells me that the Government have sent a tranquillising telegram in reply, and have told the sheikh that the departure of the new Governor-General of Arabistan for his post will be. expedited. A peremptory telegram has also been addressed to the Bakhtiaris by the Prime Minister desiring them to cease hostilities. I spoke strongly to the Regent about the importance of preserving order in Arabistan, and reminded His Highness that there were important British interests in that province, and that it was absolutely necessary to prevent the Bakhtiaris plundering along the roads. I also said that His Majesty’s consular officers on the spot considered the Bakhtiaris to be clearly the aggressors, and that in all their reports furnished to His Majesty’s Legation they spoke in warm terms of the sheikh’s forbearance.

I am told by the Regent that though the object of the plot was to upset the existing form of government it is not clear what was to be set up in its place. His Highness says that the conspirators were advanced Nationalists and violent reactionaries with a strong clerical element, and that the movement was marked by a distinct anti- foreign feeling, the exasperation caused by the bombardment of the shrine of Imam Reza at Meshed being to a large degree the cause of this. It is thought that the plot has been successfully thwarted in a manner that will considerably strengthen the hands of the present Government. The police have arrested and deported to Mazanderan and Yezd some eight or nine of the ringleaders ; they have also arrested other persons, including Wahid-ul-Mulk and Suleiman Mirza, the late leader of the Democratic party in the Medjliss. These and other persons said to have been implicated in the affair will either be invited to go to to the provinces. Europe or else will be deported No. 67. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 29, 1912. MY telegram of 23rd April. British consul at Kerman reports that the governor receives neither money nor support from the Central Government and is talking of taking bast in the consulate. Mirza Hussein Khan and his allies have left Bam and have now a force of 3,000 men with two guns. Great alarm is felt in Kerman by Persians and agents of British and American carpet firms, and British consul is less confident that the rebels will hesitate to attack the town. I am again bringing to the notice of the Persian Government serious nature of the situation, inadequacy of the local forces, and the risk of loss of property to British subjects, for which the Persian Government must accept the responsibility.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 30.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 30, 1912. HIS Majesty’s acting vice-consul at Resht telegraphs as follows, dated the 29th April:— “ The inhabitants of Talish telegraphed on the 27th x\pril to the Governor of Resht that they would surrender provided that no member of the family of Sardar Amjad were sent to them as governor. Otherwise they would fight to the last drop of their blood. After consulting with my Russian colleague, governor replied that they must surrender unconditionally. “ A Russian gun-boat leaves to-day to bombard the Talish coast. There are at the present moment 250 Cossacks in Talish. My Russian colleague says that their sole object is to remove disturbing elements from the district.” No. 69. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received April 30.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 30, 1912. SITUATION at Kerman. My telegram of the 29th April. The Persian Government state that the corrupt practices of the Governor of Kerman are the immediate cause of the trouble in that district. I have consulted His Majesty’s consul as to the truth of this accusation. Colonel Haig has replied that governor is at least less corrupt than his predecessors, though it is true he is not perfect. Before being appointed to Kerman he was at Astrabad, from which place he brought a good reputation; he seems quite deserving of any support we can give him. I am replying in the above sense to Persian Government’s accusation. The latest information from Colonel Haig is to the effect that the rebels are collecting supplies three stages from Kerman, in the neighbourhood of Rayin. Should an attack on the town appear inevitable, he proposes to advise all Europeans to take refuge at his house. He does noi think the rebels will attack the consulate, but he adds that some people are less confident on this point than himself. No. 70. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.)

It is possible that the Persian Government may collapse completely, failing the advance which Russian Government refuse. Please enquire what Russian Govern ment propose to do. They may possibly be willing to arrange for the immediate conversion of the Russian Bank’s loan, or to discuss the question of an immediate loan with the bankers, with whom I understand they have been in consultation.32 No. 72.

According to a report which has just reached me from Hamadan, a telegram had been received there from Salar-ed-Dowleh to the effect that he had been joined by the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh and his adherents, and that he was on his way back to Kermanshah, whence he would advance on Hamadan. In the same telegram Salar-ed- Dowleh stated that he had instructed Amir Mofakham to advance on Sultanabad, and Mujallal-es-Sultaneh on Hamadan. From news just received from the British consular agent at Hamadan, Mnjallal-es- Sultaneh is said to have left Kurdistan for Hamadan.

YOUR telegram of the 30th April. M. Sazonof has informed me that Russian Minister of Finance is still of opinion that Russian participation in the proposed further advance to Persia is impossible. The existence of constitutional objections is confirmed by a leading member of the Duma to whom I mentioned the matter. M. Sazonof would prefer that advance should not be made by His Majesty’s Govern ment alone, and is causing enquiry to be made with a view to obtaining through a Paris bank the sum required for the Russian share. He is prepared to begin negotiations immediately for the large loan to Persia, pending the issue of which nothing can be done with regard to the conversion of the Russian Bank’s loan. His Excellency proposed that instructions should be sent to the two representatives at Tehran to prepare, after consultation with the two banks, a memorandum of proposed conditions for the loan. If the British and Russian Governments approved the conditions in the memorandum they would then ascertain from the bankers of the bociete d Etudes whether they were ready to issue a loan on these conditions. Persian Government would, M. Sazonof thinks, require about 6 , 000 , 000 k He is of opinion that the first instalment should be a fifth or sixth of this total, and that, in communicating with the bankers, the two Governments should fix the date on which it should be placed at the disposal of the Persian Government.

I discussed at considerable length yesterday afternoon with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the question of responsibility for the present disturbed state of the province of Kerman. At the end of our discussion his Excellency, while maintaining that the Governor-General had made political mistakes, practically agreed that Hussein Khan, the leader of the rebels, was the real culprit. He assured me that a strong telegram ordering him to keep the peace had been addressed to him by the Minister of the Interior. The Governor-General may not be irreproachable, but it is clear that the present situation has been brought about by intrigues against him. I hope there may noAv be an improvement in the state of affairs. No. 77. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edioard Grey.—(Received May 2.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 2, 1912. YOUR telegram of 27th April. Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me yesterday that question of capture of men responsible for outrage on Mr. Smart has not been neglected by Persian Government. He said culprits are at present moment in camp of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who is in open conflict with his brother, who has supplanted him as Ilkhani of Kashgais, and consequently cannot be captured for present. His Excellency added that other conditions contained in Sir G.

As my Russian colleague had received no instructions to make any representations to His Highness, I confined myself, when alluding to his approaching departure for Europe, to a friendly expression of your views as set forth in your telegram of the 15th April. His Highness replied that his intention was to leave Tehran on the 14th May. He said that the state of his health rendered it imperative for him to go to Europe. If the Salar-ed-Dowleh question were not settled by that date he might perhaps postpone his departure, but he had hopes that Salar would have been expelled from Persia before then. It appeared to me that His Highness—who looked ill and greatly aged had definitely decided to go, and a public announcement has since been made that he will [1340] F34 leave on the date he mentioned. He said that he would continue to act as Regent from abroad, and he assured me that he had every intention of returning to Persia at the end of his leave.

IN my telegram of the 21st instant* I furnished you with a French translation of the Persian Government’s reply to the joint proposals of the 18th February. This translation was made at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and accompanied the note. It is an accurate rendering of the Persian text, which alone bears the signature of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am much pleased to learn from your telegram of the 22 nd instant! to Sir G. Buchanan that you consider the terms of this communication satisfactory, and I have to-day, in pursuance of your telegram of the 25th instant,J advanced to the Persian Government the British share of the joint advance of 200,000Z., forwarding to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a note, which his Excellency has acknowledged, a cheque to the order of the acting treasurer-general for 100 , 0001 . I have the honour to transmit the programme for the expenditure of the joint advance. This programme was prepared by the treasurer-general, in concert with the Cabinet, and has the approval of the two legations. It will be observed that the total sum assigned to the gendarmerie is 420,000 tomans, of which 140,000 tomans are for the purchase of arms. I understand that rifles and pistols are to be ordered in Germany and side-arms in Sweden, and that the Russian Government is disposed to * See “ Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 316. f See “ Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 318. • f See “Persia, No. 5 (1912),” No. 324.allow their transit through Russia duty free, subject to satisfactory guarantees that the arms will not fall into improper hands. The other items of expenditure are, in the opinion of the Russian Minister and myself, well chosen. You will see that 100,000 tomans are set aside for pensions. One of the principal elements of unrest now prominent in the capital is the unpaid pensioners, and the sum assigned on this head enables M. Mornard to compound with these malcontents for the past year on a basis of 33 per cent, I also enclose translation of a note from the Persian Government embodying the pension arrangements for the ex-Shah and his family, as well as a translation of a note in which the Persian Government take act of the verbal communication, which I reported in my despatch of the 18th instant, regarding the engagement of instructors for the army from subjects of the minor Powers. The Persian Government would have wished to make in their answer to the joint proposals some mention of the minor Powers in the formula regarding the discussion of the formation of the army, but my colleague and I thought it better to hold them to the formula which we had induced the Minister for Foreign Affairs to insert in his original draft on the 7th instant (see my telegram of the same day*), and which had the express approval of the two Governments.

Vossuk-ed-Dowleli to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, March 25, 1912. IN pursuance of tire conversation I have had with your Excellency in connection with the grant of a pension to Mohammed Ali Mirza, and in continuation of my note of the 20 th instant, in which it was stated that the matter would form the subject of a separate note, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that, in deference to the request of His Britannic Majesty’s Legation, the Persian Government will be prepared to grant an annual pension of 75,000 tomans to Mohammed Ali Mirza. This pension will begin from the 31st March, 1912, and will be paid in quarterly instalments. For the purpose of the amortisation of the 70,000 tomans, advanced to Mohammed Ali Mirza for his departure from Astrabad, a sum of 10,000 tomans will be deducted annually from the pension of 75,000 tomans— i.e., from the current year Sichkani-il for seven years, 65,000 tomans a-year, and after that 75,000 tomans a-year will be paid. Mohammed Ali Mirza will have to pay all the expenses of his family and children who are with him, as well as the expenses of his daughter at Tehran. The Persian Government has also assigned a pension of 6,000 tomans a-year to His Imperial Highness the Etezad-es-Sultaneh, who will reside at Tehran, and this sum will be paid to him for his expenses. In case of Mohammed Ali Mirza’s decease, one-third of his pension— i.e., 25,000 tomans a-year—will be assigned to his family and will be divided among its members, and after the decease of each member his or her share of the pension will be stopped. Should Mohammed Ali Mirza again intrigue against the actual Government, or attempt to return to Persian territory and repeat his former conduct, the Persian Government will not be responsible for any of the conditions mentioned in this note. With regard to the Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property, which was confiscated on account of his misbehaviour, I have the honour to state that now, in accordance with our conversation, the property has been released, the prince having left Persia. It is obvious that this good-will on the part of the Imperial Government will continue as long as His Royal Highness will not attempt to return to Persia without the permission of the Persian authorities, and as long as he refrains from repeating his former ill- conduct.

I HAVE formally, and with great pleasure, taken note of the official representa tions made to me on the 14th instant by Mr. Churchill and M. de Giers, the first dragomans of the British and Russian Legations, on the part of your Excellency and the Russian Minister. The representations were as follows :— The Persian Minister at St. Petersburgh has asked as to the position of the British and Russian Governments in regard to the Persian army and foreign military instructors, and has asked for information whether the two Governments have the intention of defining the strength of the Persian army and whether they object to the engagement of officers from minor Powers. We have been instructed to reply to the two questions as follows : Firstly, there can be no question of the British and Russian Governments desiring the limitation of the Persian army, because, in the opinion of the two Governments, Persia should have a larger army than she has the means to create and maintain. Secondly, the two Governments will not oppose the engagement by the Persian Government of military instructors from minor Powers. I avail, &amp;c. VOSSUK-ED-DOWLEH.Mr. A.

ThO' Cabinet. —At the beginning of April the Foreign Minister tendered his resignation to the Pegent, but it was not accepted, and he subsequently withdrew it. The Ministries of Posts and Telegraphs and Justice are vacant for the present, and the Cabinet is composed as follows :— Prime Minister, Samsam-es-Sultaneh. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. Minister of the Interior, Kawam-es-Sultaneh. Minister of War, Sardar Mohtashem. Minister of Finance, Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh. The Regent. —His Highness was somewhat agitated at the beginning of the month, owing to indications of dissatisfaction among the people and to the fear of demonstrations which might be eventually directed against himself. He further complained of ill-health, and announced his intention to take short leave of absence in Europe and to start at the beginning of May. Sipahdar added to the Regent’s uneasiness by addressing him a letter containing an indictment of his policy and accusing: him of weakness. Diplomatic Changes. —Sir George Barclay left Tehran on the 12 th instant, and Sir Walter Townley arrived at Enzeli on the 13th. Emin Bey, the new Turkish Ambassador, arrived at Tehran on the 19th March. Advance to the Persian Government. —The sum of 100 , 000 k, being the British moiety of the joint Anglo-Russian advance, was handed to the Persian Government on the 28th March. Operations against Salar-ed-Dowleh. —Farman Farma left Tehran on the 6 th April for Hamadan with a considerable force. He delayed a short time at Kazvin, but eventually proceeded. A force of some 600 Bakhtiari under Shahab-es-Sultaneh and Zia-es-Sultan followed a little later and had orders to proceed to Zenjan, where they will receive further orders as to their ultimate destination. Ghilan and Mazanderan. During the past four w^eeks there has been a redistribution of Russian troops at Enzeli, Resht, and Kazvin. The 2 nd and 4th Caucasian Rifles have been relieved by a battalion of the Salianski Regiment from Russia, and the half battery of field artillery formerly at Resht has been transferred to Kazvin. According to the Russian Minister, the net result of these movements leaves 1,300 men at Resht and Enzeli, and a similar number at Kazvin. Shoa-es-Sultaneh left Astrabad for Russia on the 17th March. Ispahan. As regards the maintenance of order in the province, there has been some improvement since Sardar Zaffar’s arrival, but the situation in the town itself has remained unsatisfactory. His Majesty’s ^ consul-general reports that the Governor-General is intriguing with a view to undermining the power of the agent to the treasurer-general, and that he is38 endeavouring to provoke popular outbursts in the town by artificially putting up prices. Mr. Vice-Consul Knox and Major Capper arrived from Shiraz on the 22 nd March without incident. The former left for Tehran on the 26th March. Yezd. The situation, from a commercial point of view, continues to be most unsatisfactory, owing to the increased insecurity of the roads and to the scarcity of money. The Parsis and certain pension-holders have complained against the exactions of Majd-ul-Mamalek, the Governor-General’s chief clerk. The Central Government have sent instructions to the governor to make enquiries into the matter. Shiraz. The detachment of the new Government gendarmerie, which left Tehran at the beginning of March,arrived at Shiraz on the 5th April. An incident which may lead to trouble among the Arab tribes occurred on the 31st March. Nasr-ed-Dowleh, son of the Kawam, ordered the arrest of Peza Kuli Khan, a Sharybani Arab chief, as the latter refused to make good articles robbed from some Jahroom merchants. Eeza Kuli Khan resisted and fired shots into the room where Nasr-ed-Dowleh was sitting, whereupon the latter’s guards shot Peza Kuli Khan dead. Seistan. It is reported that a force of 2,700 Baluchis is marching on Birjand. Kermanshah. Salar-ed-Dowleh has rendered himself very unpopular in Kermanshah owing to his exactions. He has refused to accede to the proposals of the British and Bussian Governments to accept a pension and leave the country, but, according to reports received by the Central Government, has gone to the Kalhur country in order to enlist the sympathies of the tribesmen and induce them to assist him in his campaign against the Government. Mujallal-es-Sultan, one of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s lieutenants, is in the neighbourhood of Hamadan. Amir Nizam, the governor, has fortified the town. Farman Farma, with a force of Persian Cossacks and sowars, left Tehran early in April for Kermanshah via Hamadan.. Zenjan. According to reports received by the Central Government, a force of Bakhtiaris captured Zenjan at the beginning of April. Mohammed Khan, the brigand who captured the town on the 13th March, was killed. % Bashir e. Nizam-es-Sultaneh left Bushire on the 18th March for Bombay en route to Europe. On the 20 th March the Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas took refuge in the consulate at Bushire to avoid imprisonment by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The resident appealed to the governor on behalf of the refugee, and an understanding was brought about, with the result that the deputy governor left the consulate on the 28th March. Ahwaz. The question between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiaris regarding the Governorship of Shuster has been settled by the appointment of a neutral governor, Viquar-ul-Mulk, who entered the town as deputy governor on the 5th April.Sir, Mr. A.

The Administrator-General of Customs informs me that the figures in this table are only provisional, but that nny changes in them will only be of slight importance, and will not in any case have any sensible effect on the considerable increase, viz.’ 12 per cent., in the total receipts by which last year was marked. I would call your attention to the fact that the table enclosed shows an increase in the northern customs of roughly 10|- per cent., and in the southern customs of nearly 20 per cent. It the receipts at Bushire and dependencies are taken alone they show an increase of 45 per cent.

Persian Government should also be required to guarantee to these banks, m quite general terms, the concession for the construction of that railway. _ Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks, moreover, that so signal a service rendered to the Persian Government would justify England and Russia in stipulating for certain advantages which would ensure to them a favourable solution of certain long outstanding questions. . w To give an example, Minister for Foreign Affairs mentions among the questions which concern Russian interests (1) the right for Russian subjects to acquire real estate in Persia and to accept it as security for loans; (2) the improvement of the judicial procedure and of the execution of judicial decrees. I should be glad oi your observations on these suggestions.

It is thus not impossible that the cavalry at present stationed at those places may be able to be withdrawn in June (or at any rate before the winter sets in), and Sir E. Grey is therefore of opinion, while fully appreciating the drawback of deferring action too long, that it would be advisable to take no action until it is seen how the situation develops in Southern Persia. I am to enquire whether his Lordship concurs in the proposal to inform Sir W. Townley accordingly. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 9.) (Telegraphic.)

I have done my utmost to prevent him taking this step, and had even promised to support him by my presence in the citadel. He will leave the town to-morrow morning and move into camp. The rebels will probably make their appearance the following day. Should it be found necessary to move the Europeans to the consulate this will be done to-morrow. The hank are moving in their treasury this evening. The gardens round the consulate are owned by khans who are friendly disposed and who will hold them against the rebels. I believe that Turks, Hindoos, and Parsees intend to take bast here, so that, except for a certain amount of inconvenience, we are hardly likely to suffer anything. “ Things may possibly settle down quietly when the Amir Azam has left, but I feel obliged to take the necessary precautions in view of the fact that the rebels are led by a lunatic, and that many of their officers and rank and file are robbers.” No. 93.

According to the latest official information Mujallal-es-Sultan’s force completely routed Farman Farma and captured all his artillery and ammunition, including three Schneider field guns, from which, however, Farman Farma is reported to have been able to remove the breech blocks in time. About 500 fedais have moved to his assistance from Sultanabad, and have reached Hamadan on their- way to the small village outside Hamadan where Farman Farma is awaiting reinforcements. Owing to conflicting orders issued to the fedais by the Armenian Central Committee and to seditious advice sent to them by exiled democrats they are said to be somewhat disaffected. Some 700 Bakhtiaris have been ordered to leave Zenjan for Hamadan. The entire force will be commanded by Yeprim Khan, who left Tehran yesterday. His arrival will probably inspire confidence and cohesion among the fedais. No. 94. Sir Edward Grey to Sir IF. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May 9, 1912.

Except for 200 Kalhurs he lias not been joined by any of the local tribes; his forces now number less than 1 , 000 , half of which hold Bisitun. The Prince says that in order to avoid injury to non-combatants he would like to arrange with the Persian Govern ment to fight outside Hamadan—say, 12 miles or so from the town. He would accept such an arrangement. Otherwise he says that if foreign goods are damaged he will not be responsible. He begs me to telegraph to ask the legation to advise the Persian Government in this sense.” My latest information is that the Government forces are assembling at Hamadan.

But as it is important that the troops should not remain there longer than the situation lequiies, and, on the other hand, that they should not be exposed while there to unnecessary hardships, the Marquess of Crewe would suggest that Sir W. Towniey might ascertain at once fiom Colonel Douglas what is the date beyond which a decision cannot be postponed, and then apply all possible pressure upon the Persian Goverp.- ment to get the necessary measures of pacification carried out by that date.

Position of the Pussian advance is different, as fixed charges have priority, according to Russian Bank’s convention, over service of consolidated debt, while the surplus receipts are only paid over half-yearly to Persian Government.

His Majesty’s ships “Perseus” and “Alert” are on the spot, but the situation has become so grave that the resident at Bushire has urged the Government of India to dispatch 150 sepoys from Task; these will co-operate with landing parties from the ships.

The near approach of the rebels terrified the governor to such an extent that he left Government house and took bast at His Majesty’s consulate. On the receipt yesterday of some suggestions made by Colonel Haig with a view to easing the situation, I made representations to the Minister of the Interior, who received them in such an unsatisfactory manner that I thought it well to lay the whole matter before the Regent. His Highness expressed concern, and undertook to back up any vigorous steps which I might take on behalf of the Governor of Kerman. I therefore instructed Mr. Churchill to go at once to see the Minister of the Interior and to insist on an immediate warning being telegraphed to the rebels of such a nature as would ensure the safety of Kerman, and to demand the fulfilment of the remedial measures proposed by His Majesty’s consul. The Minister of the Interior showed some slight hesitation, but eventually complied. I visited the telegraph office in the middle of the night and had a long conversation over the wire with the consul and the governor. I was able to induce the latter to leave the consulate and to resume his duties at Government house. No. 104. Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 17.) (Telegraphic.)

Arab, Baseri and Kavar riflemen came in later, and under chiefs, with few serbaz, Shiraz Government sowars and one mountain gun, occupied heights above Karabagh. 28rd April ilkhani, with force of probably 1,000 Kashgai riflemen under principal chiefs, marched against Soulet, then at Mishaun. 25th April outposts came into collision, Soulet’s getting worst of skirmish. Kashgais showed utmost reluctance to shed one another’s blood, and two forces sat for long time farsakh apart while Soulet treated for peace. 30th April Karabagh force joined ilkhani, and m subsequent battle Kashgais and Arabs fought side by side against Soulet. .

At an audience which we sought with the Regent yesterday afternoon, my Russian colleague and I persuaded His Highness not to leave on the 28th May, as he had intended to do, but to postpone his departure for three w T eeks, or until the situation might assume a more settled outlook. The Government troops are reported to be steadily driving back the forces of Salar-ed-Dowleh, but now T that Yeprim is dead there is little confidence in the Govern ment commanders, whose military worth is unknown. Until, therefore, a final defeat has been inflicted on the Prince, there must be no little anxiety as to the result of the campaign. Before the Regent leaves Persia he should also settle a Cabinet crisis with which we are threatened at the present moment. His Highness was very reluctant to accept our advice, but ultimately agreed to postpone his departure. No. 120. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 25.) (Telegraphic.)

The acting treasurer-general has presented to the Cabinet a proposal for his connimation m office and for the definition of his executive powers. The following is the text ol the proposal:— \ u la necessite de nommer un titulaire au poste vacant de tresorier general; “ Sur la proposition du Conseil des Ministres ; “Nous decretons : 1 . M. Jacques-Joseph Mornard, Administrateur general des Douanes, est nonime tresorier general de T Empire. 2- M. Mornard est charge en sa nouvelle qualite des attributions prevues par la loi du 23 Djauza Tangouz-il, qu’il exercera sous Tautorite dn Ministre des Finances conformement a la loi et aux rfiglements administratifs elabores par le tresorier general de concert avec le Ministre des Finances et sanctionnes par le Conseil des Ministres. “3. Le tresorier general a la direction superieure des divers services ressortissant au Ministere des Finances, y compris le service des douanes, services dont la plupart seront reorganises d’urgence par M. Mornard. “ 4. Le tresorier general doit veiller specialement a ce que les obligations financieres contractees par le Gouvernement vis-a-vis des etablissements on des sujets etrangers soient ponctuellement remplies. A cet effet, il a pleins pouvoirs de prendre, en temps opportun, les mesures necessaires afin d’eviter des retards dans le payement des interets, amortissements ou remboursements de dettes gouvernementales, ainsi que des traite- ments, subsides, indemnites ou allocations quelconques legalement accordes par le Gouvernement. “ 5. La duree du mandat confie a M. Mornard sera determinee par un contrat bilateral, qui fixera egalement le montant de ses appointements.” # l M. Mornard elaborated the above programme in concert with the Russian Minister and myself. He clearly understands that it is subject to the approval of our respective Governments and alteration by them if necessary. It will be noticed that the programme is based on the law of the 23rd June, 1911, passed by the late Medjliss, and that care has been taken to associate, nominally, at any rate, the Minister of Finance and the Cabinet with the treasurer-general. Article 4 is so framed as to place in the hands of the treasurer-general entire control of all sources of revenue devoted to the service of foreign loans. As Persian Ministers strongly dislike the idea of any curtailment of their financial prerogatives, the measure will probably encounter considerable opposition. In reply to a direct question which we put to the Regent two days ago, His Highness replied that neither he nor the Government had anyone to propose in the place of M. Mornard. I know of no better candidate ; an important point in his favour is that he under stands the Persians. * Translation. —“ Having regard to the necessity of making a definite appointment to the vacant post of treasurer-general; . “ On the proposal of the Council of Ministers ; “We decree: “ 1.

The latest news from Kerman is that the Governor-General attacked the rebels on the 26th, defeated and dispersed them. No. 125. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 29.) Sir, Tehran, May 14, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you, herewith, copies of despatches which I have received from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah upon the subject of the communication he made, under instructions from the legation and in conjunction with his Russian colleague, to balar-ed-Dowleh, advising him to retire from Persian territory. As you^ will remember, Sir, it was agreed between my predecessor and the Russian Minister here that the fact of the above-mentioned communication having been made by the two consuls should be made public by each of them. You will observe from a perusal of Mr. McDouall’s despatch of the 15th ultimo that this arrangement was not carried out by his Russian colleague, and that the British Consulate has thereby incurred some animus among Salar-ed-Dowleh’s partisans, and that the Russian consul has stated that he received no instructions to act in this sense. I have called M. Poklewsky s attention to this omission on the part of the Russian consul, and he has assured me that he must have misunderstood his instructions, and that he would write to him on the subject. The situation of Salar-ed-Dowleh has throughout the last few weeks been extremely obscure, as^ the means of communication between Kermanshah and Tehran have been practically interrupted. Neither this legation nor the Russian Minister, nor the Persian Government has been in possession of any trustworthy information as to the number of his following, the importance of the adherents he has managed to collect, and the strength of the force he is likely to be able to put in the field. From rumours received he has been reported to have been first with Daoud Khan, and then with the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, whilst at another moment he was said to be marching on Dizful againsthavmg made an alliance with the Sheikh of Mohammerah and with the Yah oi rusht-i-Kuh. From latest advices he would appear to have been unsuccessful in his endeavours to secure the co-operation of powerful chieftains and to have returned to Kermanshah at the head of a force variously estimated at from 1,000 to 2,000 men, mostly Kurds who are unlikely to f°how him far, and that the tribes are not with him. It is possible that the publication of the action taken by His Majesty’s consul may have had a deterrent effect upon certain of the chiefs, as would appear from Mr. McDouall’s report of events. ™ i yT 6 r ® ceiv f d ^ s °mewhat bombastic message from Salar-ed-Dowleh sent through Mr. McDouall under date of the 8 th May, asking me to advise the Persian Government to send their army to meet him outside Hamadan, as he would be unable to guarantee the life and property of the inhabitants of the city if the battle took place nearer to it, or within its walls. My Kussian colleague has received no communication in this sense, ^ u aVe mere] y r ^P ea ^ e ^ ^ to the Regent in the course of a social visit as a good joke, showing that^ Salai has still some sense of humour left or has lost none of the overweening conceit that has caused him to proclaim himself Shah on more than one occasion. The above-mentioned telegram was dispatched before Salar-ed-Dowleh could have received news of the engagement some thirty miles outside Hamadan between Farman Farma and Mujallal-es-Sultan, as reported in my telegram of the 9 th instant, which resulted in the discomfiture of the Government troops, and in the loss of three Schneider field guns and some mountain batteries with all their ammunition. It is officially stated that the breach-blocks of the guns were removed before they were abandoned, and accounts vary as to the strength of the forces engaged. The advantage has not been pushed by the enemy, who have allowed Farman Farma to recover from his defeat, and have given time for reinforcements to come up from the Sultanabad and Zenjan. There is some doubt as to how the former troops who are Armenian fedais under Kerri Khan may behave, as there is known to be disaffection in their ranks. Their trusted leader Yeprim Khan has now joined them, and there is reason to believe that he may, by the force of his personality, and the prestige of his previous victories, induce them tO' fight loyally. The other reinforcements that have reached Hamadan are Bakhtiaris. Yeprim Khan will presumably command the Government forces which will probably have engaged Salar-ed-Dowleh before you receive this despatch. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 125. Consul McDouall to Sir W. Toumley. Sir, Kermanshah, April 6, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that your telegram dated the SOth March through the Bank, Hamadan, reached me on the afternoon of the 5th April. I at once called on my Russian colleague and arranged to visit Salar-ed-Dowleh the next morning. On arrival we read him a translation of the first part of the communication. He replied that he was much obliged as his hands had been tied out of respect to the legations as they were acting as mediatories, now he would proclaim himself Shah and fake steps to notify the Powers of his accession. We then gave the last part of the communication. He said that he had not come to Persia to get a pension, but as a Persian his heart was moved by the affliction of his country in the hands of a boy King, an incapable Regent, and Ministers wdiose only aim was to fill their own pockets. I told him that he should consider carefully before finally refusing when twm Powers such as Britain and Russia were united in making a demand no Great Power even would lightly refuse. My Russian colleague also urged him to consider as a refusal was very serious. He replied that the two Powers were not so unjust as to attack him themselves, and even then he would have the support of the entire Mahometan world, some 400,000,000 people. All he asked was that the legations should compare the state of the provinces in his occupation with that of Tehran and other places in Persia. I mentioned that trade in Kermanshah was at a standstill since his arrival, he refused to admit this and said the road was safe. We pointed out that his tribesmen could not withstand a proper army which was now to come against him. He said the sooner they came the better, that the matter might be settled. After further urging him to accept without effect we left.The fact is that he is so carried away by dreams of future greatness that it is impossible to convince him of the reality of his position. I have sent Mr. Soane a copy of the telegram to make known to any of the Khans he is in communication with, and communicating to various men locally. It is said in the town that the communication made by the two consuls yesterday was due to the action of the British Minister and consul only. My munshi warns me that Salar-ed-Dowleh’s men believing that we are their enemies might try to injure the consulate or British subjects. Personally I hardly think it likely but it is possible, if there is any delay in the re-establishment of a Government here. Salar-ed-Dowleh is going to Harunebad, the headquarters of Daoud Khan, to interview the local chiefs and arrange their quarrels. I have, &amp;c. w. McDouall. Enclosure 2 in No. 125. Consul McDouall to Sir W. Townley. Sir, Kermanshah, April 15, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that, in accordance with the instructions in Sir G. Barclay’s telegram through the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Hamadan, I have taken steps to make known the communication made to Salar-ed-Dowleh on behalf of the legations. My Russian colleague states that he has no orders to publish this. I first informed Samsam-el-Mamalek, the chief of the Sinjabi tribe. He said that his son Ali Akbar had formed a combination against Daoud Khan Kalhur but was now holding his hand as Daoud was Salar-ed-Dowleh’s most trusted supporter and he was not strong enough to oppose Salar-ed-Dowleh if he supported Daoud. If a man of such rank as Farman Farma arrived in Kermanshah with even 500 men and two guns his presence would be sufficient and the combination would deal effectively with Daoud. Such action must be at once or the tribes would be obliged to join, or at least to send small contingents to SaJar-ed-Dowleh. I informed Aga Mohammed Mehdi Mujtehed, who at once left for his village, and no mujtehed of any importance except Aga Rahim is now in evidence. On the 8th I sent a messenger to Pusht-i-Kuh to the vali with a copy of the communication and also sent by post to Mr. Vice-Consul Soane at Kasr, for publication. I sent for the ilkhani, son of late Farukh Khan, head of the Hajizadeh branch of the Kalhur in the town and de jure Ilkhani of Kalhur. I told him that as he had rendered some service in protecting British subjects when the town was plundered, I wished him to know what had been communicated to Salar-ed-Dowleh and to Mujallal- es-Sultan that he might consider his position. He said his position was different from that of others as he was a townsman and had rights and estates in the country now usurped by Daoud Khan. His first object was the protection of the town. He considered that there was no immediate necessity to change his course of action but in say a month’s time when Farman Farma was really advancing he would know what to do. On the 13th about 100 of the Prince’s adherents met at the house of Aga Rahim. The principals being Ilkhani, Salar Mozaffir and Meshedi Hassan, brother of the late Muin-er-Raya. Aga Rahim said he was afraid at the news which emanated from the British consulate and thought of leaving, the others said there was nothing from the Russian consulate and all that was clear was that the British were enemies of Salar-ed- Dowleh. Aga Rahim suggested writing to Tehran saying that they were poor inoffensive people and submitted to anyone who came with a force, and to ask for an amnesty. The others refused. ' They finally drew up and dispatched a letter to Salar-ed-Dowleh that from the time he left the British consulate had spread stories that Mohammed Ali has left and that Salar-ed-Dowleh must leave, and that the Government in Tehran is powerful, that it is imperative that he get, in any way, the vali to join him and that he return at once to Kermanshah with the vali’s forces or he will lose the town. If the vali is not with him and he can do nothing he must inform them that they may provide for their safety. The fact that the Russian consul says nothing and that the Turkish consul is at the Prince’s services makes the populace believe that only the British are the Prince’s enemies and should he return in force he may make it unpleasant for British subjects.There has been no change in the situation in Tabriz during the past four weeks. Salar ed Dom leh has no loyal friends, those who join him do it out of policy or fear some affam for the sake of p under others hpf&gt;nna« ^ ^ oncy or tear, , j PVPT1 if mwo- a n ’ because they are too much committed to him fn/thp ntrtLf i p‘l °d taln ^ G °y e ™ ment P ai 'don, know that they would be murdered for the part that they have taken in ill-treatmg the townsmen.

Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending May 14, 1912. Tehran. His Majesty's Minister. —Sir Walter Townley arrived at Tehran on the 18th April, and presented his credentials to the Shah on the 20th. Political Arrests.—At the end of April a number of political arrests were made, including Sardar Mohy and his two brothers (Kerim Khan and Amid-es-Sultan)' Yamin-i-Nizam, Naser-ul-Islam, Suleiman Mirza (the leader of the democratic party)' Montasser-es-Sultan, Seyyid Jelil Ardebili, and Wahid-ul-Mulk. In all, about twenty persons were arrested and expelled from Tehran. Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab was at the same time given his passport. Elections to the Medjliss. —Early in May a decree signed by the Regent and dated the 30th April was published. It referred to the Regent’s intention to proceed on a journey to Europe and to the necessity of proceeding as soon as possible with the elections for a new Medjliss. A translation of this document is enclosed in a separate despatch. Operations against Salar-ed-Dowleh. —On the 6 th May news reached Tehran of the defeat of Farman Farma’s force by that of Mujallal-es-Sultan. The following day Yeprim Khan left Tehran for Hamadan to lead the Armenian volunteers. The Armenian confederation at Tehran has in the meantime raised objections to the employment of the Armenian volunteers in the service of the Persian Government on the ground that the constitution appears to be in abeyance. Negotiations are still in progress on this subject between the leaders of the confederation and the Government. The Regent. —The Regent, who had decided to leave Tehran on the J4th May, has put off his departure for a fortnight. On the 11 th and 12 th May His Highness received the various diplomatic missions to say farewell. Tabriz.His Majesty’s vice-consul reported on the 15th April that the Russian force in Tabriz had been increased by 500 men and that 1,400 Russian infantry had crossed the frontier for Khoi. Gillian, Mazanderan, and Talish. The provinces of Ghilan and Mazanderan have remained quiet, but in Talish there has been some fighting between the natives and the Russian troops, owing to the former having refused to accept as governor the nominee of the Russian consul-general at Resht. The Russian troops were withdrawn from Talish to Astara early in May, after having restored order in half the district. The Russian authorities have not yet decided whether or not to send a second expedition to complete the pacification of the district. The prospective governor, who accompanied the Russian troops to Astara, has now returned to the quiet district. On the 25th April 200 Cossacks arrived from Russia and 400 infantry from Kazvin. The infantry left the same day for Baku. Ispahan. Owing to the continued rise in the price of food-stuffs, the distress among the poorer classes is reported to be greater now than it was during the winter months. There has been little or no improvement in the insecurity in the province. On the 18th April Major Petersen, one of the Swedish officers with the Government gendarmerie, returning from Shiraz to Tehran with a small party, was fired on at Murchikhurt, some 20 miles north of Ispahan, and one of his gendarmes, who was in search of fodder, was captured by the tribesmen. Major Petersen managed to escape with the remainder of his party, and the captured gendarme was released on the following day. Sardar-i-Zalfar, the Governor-General, has continued in his opposition to Mr. Haycock, the agent to the treasurer-general. On the 17th April a meeting took place between them with a view to coming to an understanding, but the proposals put forward by his Excellency were so extravagant that they are not likely to be accepted by the Central Government. Yezd. An agitation, instigated by the clergy and certain notables of Yezd and Ardistan, is on foot against Shahab-ed-Dowleh, the Governor-General. On the 7th May a body of 400 Arab tribesmen was reported to be advancing on Yezd from the south-west, and another force, consisting of about 150 Baharlus, was reported to have captured the hamlet of Shahr-i-Babek, 100 miles south of Yezd. Shiraz. A deputation of Arab chiefs entered Shiraz on the 18th April to express their dissatisfaction with Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s administration of the Kamseh tribes, especially in connection with the killing of Reza Kuli Khan (vide summary for last month). Kawam, Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s father, conciliated them by promising to take over the administration of the Kamseh tribes himself. On the 23rd April the ilkhani left Shiraz with some 1,000 Kashgais to march against Soulet-ed-Dowleh, his brother, the former ilkhani of the Kashgais. On the 30th April a force of Arab tribesmen joined him, and on the 6 th May, with his combined force of Kashgais and Arabs, he attacked and dispersed Soulet’s following. Soulet-ed-Dowleh fled to the hills with a few of his adherents, followed up by Mohammed Beg, a Kashkuli chief, with 400 men. Kerman. Early in April Amir-i-Azam, the governor, who apparently had received no funds since his arrival in Kerman, sent Mirza Hussain Khan, his chief of police, into the district with an armed force to collect revenue. &gt; On the 22nd April news reached Kerman that Mirza Hussain Khan, together with[1340] I Rifaat-i-Nkam, the ^ Governor of Bam, and certain local khans, was marching on Kerman with the object of plundering the town and expelling the governor. . As th 1 e g° vernor was receiving no support from the Central Government, chiefly owing to the intrigues of bardai Nasrat, and as most of his troops had deserted owing to want of pay, he was with difficulty restrained from abandoning the town to its fate. However, on lepresentations being made by His Majesty’s Minister, the Central Government telegraphed to Amir-i-Azam and to the rebels, saying that a special commissioner would be sent to enquire into the causes of dissatisfaction, and warning the rebels against entering the town. On the 11 th May the rebel force encamped some two marches from Kerman, and on the following day, at the request of the governor, His Majesty’s consul addressed an assembly of the leading men of the city, and pointed out to them the grave responsibility they would incur if they allowed the rebels to enter the town. At the time of writing pourparlers are in progress between the governor and the rebels, and the situation appears to be hopeful. Kermanshah. Farman Farma arrived at Hamadan on the 5th April, and on the 3rd May advanced against Mujallal-es-Sultan. The opposing forces met on the 5th May, when the Govern ment troops were defeated and compelled to fall back on Hamadan. Yeprim arrived in Hamadan on the 11th May with 200 men, and will join Farman Farma when he again advances. Further reinforcements for the Government troops are reported to be en route for Hamadan. Salar-ed-Dowleh, after his attempts to enlist the services of the Kalhurs and of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, with what success is not known, returned to Kermanshah with a following of about 600 on the 12th May. The Sinjabi and other smaller tribes, although not openly breaking with Salar-ed- Dowleh, sent no representatives to meet him when he was at Ghilan. Bushire. Owing to the presence of robber bands in the Kazerun valley, the merchants of Shiraz have telegraphed to the Bushire merchants that no merchandise should be forwarded. Plague has broken out at Ahmedi and in the neighbouring villages half-way between Bushire and Borasjun. Bunder Abbas. The deputy governor, who was a refugee in the consulate from the 20 th to the 28th March, again took bast on the 20th April on learning that the “ Persepolis ” was expected with tofangchis on board, as he feared arrest. On the 21st April the bazaars were closed, and some 200 merchants and others took refuge in the consulate as a protest against the oppression of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. On the 11th May the situation was rendered still more unsatisfactory by the arrival of a party of about 200 raiders some 10 miles from the town. Shuster. In spite of the fact that Viquar-ul-Mulk, a neutral governor, entered Shuster on the 5th April, and that the Central Government had given orders for an enquiry to be made into the differences between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtiaris, the latter occupied Shuster in force on the 1st May. On receipt of this news the sheikh collected a force of 10,000 men at Ahwaz and advanced on Shuster. The sheikh’s action, together with His Majesty’s Minister’s representations to the khans to withdraw- their forces pending the result of ^ the enquiries about to be conducted, led to the evacuation of the town by the Bakhtiaris on the 9th May.Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 29.) Sir, Tehran, May 14, 1912. THE situation in the neighbourhood of Shuster has been the cause of no small amount of anxiety during the past few weeks. It having been brought to my notice by His Majesty’s consular officers at Mohammerah and Adiwaz that the Bakhtiaris showed a firm determination to establish themselves at Shuster, to the detriment of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and his adherents, I renewed representations previously made by Sir Gr. Barclay to the Bakhtiari khans in Tehran, and I warned the Persian Government that a most serious situation might be created were a conflict to break out in Arabistan, which would not only endanger the safety of what is known as the Bakhtiari road, and consequently largely hamper British trade, but might have a most important effect upon the general situation in Persia. The khans replied that they are the possessors of several villages in the immediate neighbourhood of Shuster, and claimed that they are much more genuinely interested in that district than are the Sheikh of Mohammerah and his Arab followers. At the same time they promised me to send stringent orders to the local khans to refrain from hostilities, and to await the result of an enquiry into the conflicting claims which is being conducted on the spot by His Majesty’s consuls at Mohammerah and Ahwaz, who have further had the invaluable assistance of the advice of Sir Percy Cox, who has visited the Karun district lately. I forwarded a list of the villages claimed by the Sardar Assad and the Minister of War as being in the neighbourhood of Shuster and as belonging to themselves or their dependents to Major Haworth, who has replied that they are all in the Dizful district, except one important group of villages called Akili, which has always been recognised as being near Shuster. Whether or not the orders issued by the Prime Minister, Samsam-es-Sultaneh, and the Sardar Assad arrived too late I am unable to say, but it is clear from the conflicting reports that have reached me that a forward movement was made on Shuster by the Bakhtiaris, and that they occupied the town. It would equally appear evident that they subsequently evacuated the town again, although whether they did so, as is asserted by the khans here and the Persian Government, in consequence of orders received from Tehran, or whether they did so as the result of an aggressive forward movement on the part of the sheikh, as is stated by unofficial informers, I am not in a position to know. 1 have been informed by the Regent that most loyal assurances have been received by the Persian Government from the sheikh, who, in complaining of Bakhtiari aggression, has declared his willingness to await a definite settlement of the questions at issue, and has asserted that he has no desire to secure a paramount position in Arabistan at the expense of the Bakhtiaris, and has protested his willingness to co-operate loyally with the Governor of Arabistan, who will, I am promised, proceed to his post without delay. His Highness on the same occasion told me that the Bakhtiari chiefs who occupy such an important position in the Central Government of to-day have sent the most categorical orders to the local khans to refrain from hostilities, and he expressed a confident belief that peace would be preserved. I have been without definite news from the spot for some time, which leads me to indulge in a hope that the danger has been averted for the present, at all events. Meanwhile news has reached me of threatened hostilities on the road between the Bakhtiaris and the Kuhgeluis, and Messrs. Lynch’s agent has been warned to clear all the caravanserais on the road of accumulated merchandise. This information has also been brought to the notice of the Bakhtiari leaders, who have assured me that all necessary precautions for the protection of the road shall be taken. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 128. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 29.) Sir, Tehran, May 14, 1912. AS I had the honour to report to you in my telegram of the 29th ultimo, the Regent told me in the course of a conversation which I had with h^ Highness on the 28th April that the arrest of certain persons had been found to be necessary,59 [1340] 1 2 because it bad come to tbe ears of the Government that a dangerous conspiracy was being prepared which had for its object the overthrow of the existing order of things. Nasr-ul-Mulk added that a particularly unpleasant feature of the movement was the presence of a pronounced spirit of xenophobia, due in no small measure to the religious excitement that had been roused by the bombardment of the sacred shrine of Imam Reza at Meshed. He said it must not be imagined that this unfortunate event had aroused little resentment because there had not been much public display of this feeling, since such-was not in fact the case. A lezd priest who was the leader of the movement was the first person to suffer. He was arrested and deported to Mazanderan. It was at first stated that the arrest of this one man had sufficed to quell the threatened rising, but his fate was soon that of several other so-called malcontents of various political shades, such as Sardar Mohy and his two brothers, Suleiman Mirza, the leader of the Democratic party, and a good many of the prominent members in the former Medjliss of that party, whilst Wahid-ul- Mulk and Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab were advised to travel in Europe. There does not appear any good reason to suppose that these members of the Progressive party had been directly implicated in the conspiracy which had led to the earlier arrests, but it would seem clear that the moment was considered a favourable one to pay off old scores and eliminate from the political arena all the leading members of the party which had made itself conspicuous in the former Assembly by its adherence to the Shuster programme and by its uncompromising hostility to Russia. Beyond the fact that the persons arrested have been deported to various parts of the country they have not suffered personally, and in the case of those who are in need of financial assistance the Government has provided a monthly stipend. It is believed that the majority of them will be allowed to return to Tehran if and when the new Medjliss has assembled, the convocation for the election of which will form the subject of an accompanying despatch. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY, No. 129. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 29.) Sir, Tehran, May 15, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith translation of a rescript by the Regent, dated the 30th April, in which His Highness calls upon the Ministers to proceed to the election of the members of a new Medjliss in accordance with the requirements of the constitution. The rescript further explains that the elections can, of course, only be partial at the present moment on account of the disturbed state of affairs in many parts of the country, but urges the importance of having elections at Tehran as soon as possible. The rescript was not made public until several days after it was signed, but on the 1st instant the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me upon the subject, saying that the Government were of opinion that it was desirable to carry out elections as soon as might be convenient and speaking generally in the terms of the rescript. His Excellency added one point of some importance which is not alluded to in the official proclamation, namely, that it is the intention of the Government to proceed to the creation of an Upper Chamber, or Senate, as soon as can be conveniently done after the assembing of the Medjliss. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh pointed out that the Uppei Chamber would be formed, in accordance with the conditions of the constitution, of members, of whom onedialf would be nominated by the executive and one-half chosen by the Medjliss, so that no progress could be made with its institution until after the new Medjliss had entered upon its duties. His Excellency added that ciicumstances would render it necessary that nearly all the members of the Medjliss should be elected for Tehran, and that even those for other places should be voted foi at the capital. He expressed belief that it would be found possible to elect a legal quorum, namely, one member more than a half of a full house. It was early clear that this show of eagerness to proceed to new elections was made with the object of calming public opinion, and but little effort has since been made to prepare for the selection of candidates or to take any steps in the direction of naming a day for the elections, which could hardly fail in existing conditions to be a faice, w list it is more than doubtful if a quorum could be obtained. It is just possible that thehand of the Government may be forced if affairs at Hamadan do not make satisfactory progress, because the Armenian central committee of Tehran has made the holding of early elections one of the conditions under which the fedais, who have played such an important part under Yeprim Khan in the maintenance of the present order of things, will consent to fight against Salar-ed-Dowleh. The Government have given a written assurance that elections will be held, but it is couched in such vague language as to the date and conditions that the committee has become more than ever suspicious of the real intentions of the Government, and is unwilling to accept such qualified assurances. • I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 129. (Translation.) TJie Regent’s Rescript regarding Elections. To the Cabinet, April 30, 1912. YOU are aware that, in accordance with the legal requirements, I issued a firman and rescript for new elections on the occasion of the termination of the National Assembly’s legislative term, and these were published through the Ministry of the Interior. Unfortunately, owing to certain events, to the absence of governors from certain provinces, and the want of order and the perfect tranquillity which is necessary during elections, there has so far been delay in their execution. Though it is clear that, as is the custom in other countries, the object of the Government was, firstly, to prepare the ground, and then in a short time to begin 'elections, yet, as delay in this matter is not permissible, and as it is said, further more, that some people, owing to ignorance and some owing to prejudice, attribute this to negligence and indifference on the part of the Government, I urgently draw the attention of the Ministers to this point. I recommend them to make a diligent study of the question, and at all events to begin elections without delay in those places where there is a possibility of free choice and where elections are possible, and especially in the capital, which is of greater importance in comparison to other places. If, in certain places, owing to the above-mentioned conditions, there should be a measure of delay in the elections, endeavours will, of course, be made during the course of elections in other places to bring about favourable conditions as soon as possible in those parts as well. As the firmans already issued said all that was necessary on this subject, I will only repeat and urge in this memorandum that the interests and future happiness of the country depend entirely upon the result of the elections for this legislative term. I expect that a definitive decision should be arrived at without delay, and that the result will be announced, so that, before starting on a journey which I have in view, I should know that the Ministers have urgently and clearly in mind the importance of this duty and have taken measures in this respect, and that, in those places where the conditions are favourable, preliminary measures will be taken, while in such places where order and tranquillity will be restored steps will be taken in due course to carry on elections. As the primary condition for the welfare, happiness, and progress of the country depends on the carrying out of this important duty and its proper execution, the Cabinet Ministers will thereby best succeed in bringing about my happiness and peace of mind. And as this question directly concerns the Minister of the Interior I hope that, in view of his experience, he will act with special energy and vigour, and will publish this memorandum through the official press for the information of the public. I pray to God for all blessings for the Ministers, in order that they should acquit themselves of this important responsibility as soon and as well as possible, so as to assist the welfare and true happiness of the country. ABUL KASSEM.61 No. 130. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 29.) Sir, Tehran, May 15, 1912. THE situation at Kerman during tlie past month has been most unsatisfactory, and has necessitated constant representations to the Persian Government. On the 22nd April, His Majesty’s consul telegraphed that Mirza Hussein Khan, who had been dispatched with a considerable force and some guns to collect revenue in the district, had joined the khans of Jiruft and Rudbar, and that they had seized and robbed the Governor-General’s “ farrashbashi,” who was also collecting revenue, and were marching on Kerman for the purpose of expelling the governor and plundering the town. I brought the situation to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 24th April, and pointed out to his Excellency the great importance to British trade that tranquillity should prevail at Kerman, and that order should be maintained on the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road. The Minister professed to have little information upon the subject, but promised to make immediate enquiry. On the 28th April I spoke to the Regent in the same sense, adding that Colonel Haig seemed satisfied that the Amir Azam was performing his duties well, and that I had been obliged to discourage a belief to the contrary, which appeared to be prevalent at Tehran. I added that the source of this intrigue had been traced to the deputy governor, Sardar Nusrat, who was at Tehran at the present moment. I spoke somewhat strongly about Sardar Nusrat’s action, and said that I much resented his presumption in coming to the legation to endeavour to prejudice us against Amir Azam. His Highness replied that very circumstantial reports had reached him to the effect that all the trouble in the Kerman district was traceable to the extortionate habits of the Governor-General, who had sold official appointments on all sides, and had squeezed the populace as much as he possibly could. He asked me to ascertain from Colonel Haig whether there was real foundation for these stories. I communicated Colonel Haig’s reply to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 1st May. It was to the effect that if the Governor-General was not perfect, he was at least better than his predecessors. I took occasion to explain to the Minister that as long as the unfortunate system continued of making governors of provinces pay for their appointments, it must be expected that they would recoup themselves frorn their provincial subordinates. I used strictly diplomatic language, but I let the Minister clearly understand that I was aware that Amir Azam had had to pay a heavy fee for his appointment. The hint went home, not a very long way to go, as the Minister is the brother of the Minister of the Interior, with whom the appointment of provincial governors rest. The Minister promised that no effort should be spared to endeavour to restrain the advance of the rebels, but maintained his assertions that the Governor-General is a corrupt official. His Excellency subsequently sent me copies of letters said to have been found on his “ farrashbashi,” presumably when he was seized by the rebel Mirza Hussein Khan, in which Amir Azam instructed him to get as much money out of the people as he possibly could. The Minister at the same time caused me to be informed that the Government proposed to send an impartial official to hold an enquiiy on the spot, and that a communication in this sense had been sent both to the governoi and the rebel leaders, who had been ordered to await the result of this enquiry. The fact that the Government claimed to be able to bring pressure to bear on the rebels would seem to afford good proof that they have regarded the growth of the movement benevolently. His Majesty s consul has reported that constant communica tions passed between the town and the rebels during the^ past few days, and that he himself, at the governor’s request, had publicly explained the situation to the people. . For a time there appeared reason to hope that an amicable arrangement would be reached but the latest advices would seem to show that negotiations have failed, and that the rebels are rapidly approaching the town, which the governor seems impotent to defend. _, 0 I have, &amp;c.

MY telegram of 9th May. 10th May Khamseh tribesmen with their chiefs made triumphal entry into town with prisoners and loot of Soulet’s camp. 11th May ilkhani with his force arrived Chenar Rahdar. 12th May ilkhani brought all Kashgai kalantars to pay their respects to Kawam, w T ho received them in his garden just outside town. Kalantars one by one did obeisance to Kawam. Gathering was unique, as all Kashgai kalantars have never come to Shiraz together before. After ceremony Kashgai and Khamseh chiefs, who were also there, made merry together. Number of Kashgai kalantars came into town, which for several days has been full of armed Kashgais, who have been most orderly. Mass of Kashgai tribes held back by recent strife have been passing Chenar Rahdar, and migration should soon be over. It is reported Ayaz Kika Darashnli, chief responsible for treachery of 2nd May, and Soulet have slipped past northwards with small body of horsemen. Ilkhani has started for Guyoum in case there is any trouble. If Soulet goes north he may intend either to collect Darashulis and non-Kashgai elements with a view to fighting at Baiza. Soulet’s wife, who is a Kashkuli, is reported to be about 30 miles south of Shiraz with one of Kashkuli khans, but it is not known where his children are. No. 132. Sir W.

Persian Transport Company to Foreign Office.- {Received May 29.) 3, Salters'' Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, gir5 May 28, 1912. I AM directed by my board to acknowledge the receipt of yonr letter of the 22nd instant, and to request you to convey their thanks to Sir W. Townley for the steps he has taken to press upon the khans the necessity for adequate protection to caravans traversing the Ahwaz-lspahan road. As regards the abandonment of work on the Godar bridge, I am directed to inform you that our engineeer, Mr. Sotham, telegraphed us on the 14th instant to the effect that he has carried out such necessary repairs to the bridge as, in his opinion, will render it safe against further deterioration for at least twelve months. He goes on to say:— “I have had no support from the Bakhtiari, although rigorous instructions were sent from the khans in Tehran ; they are not in the country and they have no authority. Great difficulty experienced with guards, whom I pay heavily, over closing bridge for a few hours. My men have been assaulted ; my life once threatened ; had greatest difficulty in carrying on work. Kuhgelus expected raid road soon ; road already unsafe. Last two couriers from Ahwaz beaten and robbed on road.” Owing to neglect on the part of the chiefs to act on the advice given by Mr. Sotham in December last, that the bridge should be closed to traffic, the sag had become so pronounced that on his arrival in March the bridge was on the point of collapsing. The correction of the sag can now only be carried out by dismantling the bridge, wine i means closing it to traffic for at least two months. It had been our earnest desire to get the whole of the work thoroughly done at t re present time, and to this end our agents have made repeated appeals to the khans to take such protective measures as would enable our engineer to carry out his dimcu t task with promptitude and safety. These steps not having been taken and the season having now so far advanced as to render it difficult to work except at night and the early morning owing to the intense heat, we have been compelled to withdraw our engineer and his staff.* L have $cq-» ’T?RT?/n W PARTLY. Actina Secretary. No. 134. Sir W.Townley to Sir Edward Grey—(Received May 30.) Tehran, May 19, 1912. lr ’ I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith translation of a decree recently issued by the Regent in the name of the Shah and countersigned by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Interior, authorising the acting treasurer- general to proceed to the collection and storage of Government grain m the district o Tehran and in the adjacent districts wherever he may consider such collection ^^The'execution of this decree should serve two purposes = Firstly, it should protect the people from the should secure' arTample Supply of grain for the wants of the capital M Mornard estimates that the amount of gram from the above-quotea sources brought to market in the past season, which was an average agricultural one did not exceed 15°000 khalvars, whereas he estimates that TOO lhallm “ it should amount to at least 60,000 khalvars and possibly In addition to the very great material advantage that it antl “^ted the people of Tehran will derive from this measure, the issue of the decree may nave a most important bearing upon the executive functions of the treasurer-general. It may m * Note.— Besides taking the measures, recorded in sub^quen^ the expenses incurred in restore order on the road, the Bakhtiari eventually agreed to pay repairing the Godar bridge.a sense be considered as the thin edge of the wedge inserted into the system by which Cabinet Ministers sought to keep in their own hands such lucrative duties as the collection of the Government grain which during the past season has been cornered and diverted to personal purposes in such a shameless manner that it was one of the crying abuses to which I called the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of my first visit to his Excellency. It is also a sign that 'the Government realise that the mission of the treasurer-general is a serious one, and that the two legations are heartily in accord in seeking to make it a material success. No pressure to secure the adoption of the proposal was required, fortunately, but there can be no doubt that the knowledge of the solidarity of the two Governments influenced the Cabinet very considerably. M. Mornard is of opinion that the decree confirms indirectly the powers of the treasurer-general as under the law of 23 Jauza, Tankouz-il, and doubtless it will serve as a most useful precedent for the extension of his administrative powers in other parts of the country. It will, however, probably be found desirable to clearly define the duties of the treasurer-general at an early date, so that it is hardly necessary to attach more importance to the above-quoted law of the late Medjliss than the very useful fact that it gives the decree as it were a legal sanction under the constitution.

The treasurer-general, in accordance with his duties fixed by law of 23 Jauza, Tankouz-il, will take steps from now for the collection of Government grain m the district of Tehran and its adjacent districts in any place which he considers prontable, whether from privately owned or Government lands, and will have the grain stoied in the Government stores for the special use of the inhabitants of the capital. Art. 2.

The officials will be careful to act m accordance with custom, and those who have to pay taxes in kind and the lessees of the Crown lands may not, under any pretext, delay or refuse the payment ot the dues claimed by the revenue officials. Art. 3. The owners of private land and the lessees of Crown lands or their representatives will send a delegate to the spot to hand over the Government grain to the collectors. If such a representative is not present, a written notice will be sent, and it such a notice is not observed within fifteen days, the collectors will have the right to take the Government grain from the harvest of the place. . case ^ le taxpayers or the lessees of Crown lands have any complaints against the treasury officials or consider the amount claimed to be illegal, they will submit their complaints in writing to the treasurer-general. The latter, after careful consideration, will refer the matter, if he thinks fit, to a commission, which will be established for this purpose at Tehran. Ait. 5.

According to His Highness the Persian Government had made up their mind that the post in question should be filled by a foreigner.

Threatened Russian movement against the Shahsevans is causing Persian Government considerable alarm. They are afraid that the intention of the Russian Government is to annihilate the tribe entirely. I am informed by my Russian colleague that reinforcements are to be sent to Sarab from Tabriz, and that the Russian Prime Minister has requested the Caucasus authorities to send troops. This is, of course, in addition to the detachment already sent from Resht.

As soon as the Cabinet was reconstructed the Mininister for Foreign Affairs resigned. It has been therefore impossible to make any further progress with the question of obtaining reparation for the attack on our troops. Ala-es-Sultaneh has to-day been definitely appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Y 7 ossuk-ed-Dowleh’s place. The Minister of the Interior came to see me this morning. He assured me that the question had received his earnest consideration since his assumption of office three weeks ago. He said that he had telegraphed repeatedly to Shiraz insisting that the culprits be arrested. He added that he hoped matters might improve greatly after the [1340] Larrival of the new Governor-General, Mnkliber-es-Snltaneh, at his post , the latter was, he said, leaving for Shiraz in a few days’ time. I strongly doubt the power of the present Government to secure the arrest of the culprits. The late Minister for Foreign Affairs asserted that the}' weie with Sonlet, but this does not seem to be the case. I am of opinion that the Government entirely realise the situation ; they are, how ever, unfortunately unable to effect anything.

Colonel Haig reports that the Governor-General intends to execute the two men they are old offenders, have been captured in open warfare against the constituted authority, and are responsible for much misery in the province. Colonel Haig agrees with the Governor-General, and thinks that it would be folly to pursue any other course. Though I am very reluctant to do so, I am obliged to concur in this view, as m the present distracted state of the country such an example is, in my opinion, necessary. If breakers of the peace are not severely punished when captured it is hopeless to expect public order to be re-established. 1 have given no advice to the Governor-General on the subject, as he has not asked my opinion.

As you know, we made the withdrawal of the detachment from Bushire conditional upon the surrender of these men. We shall have to build quarters for the troops at Shiraz if we are obliged to leave them there. Unless, therefore, the Persian Government undertook to refund the cost of the buildings when eventually evacuated, we could not grant them an extension of time for compliance with our demand. I gather that the Persian Government are quite unable to secure the arrest of the guilty parties, but you should report whether they have really attempted to negotiate with the tribes for this purpose.

The acting British consul at Shiraz and Colonel Douglas seem to think that the troops must stay on, or that punitive measures must be undertaken by His Majesty’s Government. The consul-general at Bushire is absent and cannot be reached by telegraph.

I .HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copies of despatches received from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah, reporting upon the recent military events which have led up to the eventual triumph of the Government forces, to the recapture of Kermanshah, and to the defeat and flight of the army under Salar-ed-Dowleh and Muj allal-es-Sultan. You will notice, Sir, that the first of these despatches contains a report of assurances given to Mr. McDouall by Salar-ed-Dowleh of his friendly feelings towards the British Government, in spite of the fact that British action in the past had been hostile to his family. Mr. McDouall communicated this passage to me by telegraph, but I returned no reply. Neither did I answer a later telegraphic communication sent to me direct by Salar-ed-Dowleh, in which he asked me to invite the Persian Government to send their troops 16 miles outside Hamadan to fight him, as he would not otherwise be able to guarantee the life and property of the peaceable citizens of that town. The progress of the military movements has been reported to you by telegraph as anything of interest occurred. The march of Earman Farma, who was in command of the Government forces, and who left Tehran early in April was very leisurely. He did not reach Hamadan until nearly the end of the month. His first encounter with the forces of Salar-ed-Dowleh under Muj allal-es-Sultan was most unfortunate, as he was severely defeated with the loss of several guns. The Minister for Foreign Affairs subsequently told me that the battle was of a “ bonffe ” nature. The two armies when they came in sight of each other fired at each other and then fled incontinently, Mujallal winning because he looked round first, and discovered that he and the enemy were playing the same game. Although it was fully expected that Farman Farma would be beaten, and much wit was expended over his discomfiture, general consternation was felt when the news reached Tehran. The famous Yeprim Khan was at once dispatched to the front to take command of the Armenian fedais, who had been hurried up from Hamadan. The Bakhtiari contingent which had gone round by Zenjan received orders to proceed to the scene of action with all speed. Yeprim hastened to Hamadan in motor-cars which had by chance been assembled from Baku for the Regent’s voyage to Enzeli. Upon Yeprim’s arrival affairs assumed a more business-like turn. He advanced at once to meet Mujallal, who had withdrawn some distance to the rear on hearing of his approach, and taken up a strong defensive position in some hills. The battle commenced at 9 a.m., and by 4'30 p.m. it appeared as if the Government forces had won a decisive victory, when Yeprim Khan rashly approached a mud-tower, from which some unpleasant sniping had been annoying him during the battle. There would appear to have been no sort of reason for his doing this, as his men were quite able to capture and punish the sharpshooters in the tower. It seems he had got quite close to the tower when a young Persian doctor of much promise was shot down by his side. At an exclamation of warning from another companion, Yeprim looked up, and as he did so, a bullet fired from the tower struck him at the comer of the mouth, passing out at the back of his neck and shattering his skull.

O’ r tt awt- Kermanshah, May 15, 1912. 1 HAVE the honour, to report that yesterday Salar-ed-Dowleh wrote asking me to call upon him. I complied, and he said that he wished me to explain to you that his position was that of a Persian patriot, and that his only object was the restoration of order and establishment of a capable Government in Tehran, which those at present in power could never succeed in doing. He could be of much more use to the British than bardar Assad, who was bound by the promises which he had made to M. Isvolsky, the Russian Ambassador in Paris, when he was last there. He (the Prince) personally had no reason to love the British, Avho had handed him over to his brother when he took refuge in the consulate here, which led to his imprisonment and exile and loss of estates ; but as a patriot he fully recognised that the British Government was really anxious to preserve the integrity of Persia, and further, that it aauis in their interest that that integrity and independence should be preserved. He therefore was anxious to do all he could to support British interests, and had throughout given orders to respect British goods. I said that according to reports from Hamadan, Mujallal-es- bultan had given out that as the Ministers of Tehran had sold Persia to the two Powers, the Ulema of Kurdistan had authorised a “jehad” against the two Powers, and that foreign goods Avould first be looted. He replied that the story was a trick of his enemies, and Mujallal could not circulate such a story without his orders, which had not been given. I promised to let you know what he had said. He then told me that Ali Akbar Khan Sinjabi had left for Mujallabs camp with bOO men, and others would follow. My information is that they have not yet left. I have, &amp;c. w.

I HAVE the honour to report in continuation of my despatch of yesterday,' that from further information obtained it appears that on hearing of the quarrel between the tribes, Kazim Khan Sinjabi and Salar Arshad Kurdistani, who were with the Miijallal-es-Sultan when he defeated Farman Farma, returned. They advised great care, as Farman Farma’s force was only a small one. Mujallal wrote to Salar-ed-Dowleh that instead of receiving reinforcements some of his force had left to take part in the tribal quarrels of Kermanshah, and urging him to ^arrange matters and send reinforcements. Salar sent some Ulema and others to the Sinjabis, and^ in consequence Samsam-el-Mamalek came to the Prince. Ihe Prince embraced him, called him his father, and gave him 3,000 tomans and other presents. Samsam said that the tribes would not accept to be placed under the Government_ of Kalhurs, and if they and the Kalhurs met there would be lighting, it was impossible for them to serve in the same army as Kalhurs. Salar promised that if they would support him they should never be made to submit to Sardar Mozaffir, He requested that 800 men should go under Ali Akbar and Kazim Khans to Kurdistan to reinforce Mujallal, and Sardar Mozaffir would accompany the army under himself. Samsam appears to have agreed, and returned to his village to see his son Ali Akbar, who is the real head of the combination, and it has not yet transpired whether he will accept. They are probably awaiting news from Farman Farma, and should he defeat Mujallal before they leave they would not go. Sardar Mozaffir has written to Ihtesham-el-Mamalek, of Kerind, that he was quite right to punish the Kalhurs for their misbehaviour. He is evidently frightened at the strength of the combination, and will not fight unless attacked by them. He is expected here in a day or two to join in an advance towards Kangawar, but his movements are always uncertain. The ilkhani, who is at Sahneh with 300 to 400 men, informed Salar-ed-Dowleh that the Khezel were holding their border, and Salar instructed him not to advance but to hold Sahneh. I have, &amp;c. w.

IN continuation of my despatch of the 16th May, I have the honour to inform you that the Sinjabi chief has replied to Salar-ed-Dowleh’s messenger that as he has a quarrel with the Kalhurs, as long as their contingent has not advanced from Kermanshah, he cannot, and further, that there being trouble on the frontier stirred up by the Kalhurs, he cannot spare a man. None of his sons have returned to Kurdistan. On hearing of the fighting between the Bajlan and Sheikh, Nasir-ed-Din, Ali Akbar Khan Sinjabi left with 300 men to support the Bajlan. Sardar Mozaffir has informed Salar-ed-Dowleh that he cannot come until the Sinjabi contingents have left Kermanshah, and further, that he will come wdien the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh does. The latter replies that he will come, but in each letter makes some excuse for delay. Salar-ed-Dowleh being dependent on the Kermanshah tribes is in a difficult position. Mujallal-es-Sultan is constantly writing to him for reinforcements and to come in person ; but the Prince can do nothing. He sends false messages to his supporters reporting the arrival of various chiefs to try and encourage them. I have reason to believe that he is preparing to flee. I have, &amp;c. w. McDouall.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey,-(Received July 1.) O’ ’ A ATHt A rtT- T i n Te/mau, June 14, 1912. . ADVAA1AUL has been taken of the presence of Captain Grey, His Majesty’s vice-consul at Ahwaz, to go fully into all the questions with which the Bakhtiari khans are concerned. Of these the most important is the state of tension approaching to open hostilities that at present exists between the Bakhtiaris and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. You are awaie, Sir, that a serious conflict between the parties was only averted last spiing tq the piessure brought to bear upon the khans by the legation at Tehran and by the counsels of moderation urged upon the sheikh by His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah. Unfortunately these good offices ha-ve resulted in both parties considering that they have suffered serious material losses because they listened to the advice given. The Bakhtiaris claim that they duly evacuated Shuster under instructions received from the Persian Government and at the instance of His Majesty’s legation. They assert that after they had done so the sheikh’s men not only occupied 'the town but burned the crops and villages of Akili, by which deed damage to the value of 100.000 tomans (20,000b) was done to the property of Sardar Motashem, the Minister of War. They further assert that certain of their adherents and dependents who had remained at Shuster were imprisoned and ill-treated by the Arabs. the khans, but more especially Sardar Motashem, are furious at what they consider to be a breach of an agreement made under the auspices of the Persian Government, and they are resentful towards His Majesty’s legation because they say that they never would have adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the sheikh had they not been assured that he would on his side observe the terms of the contract. Sardar Motashem declares emphatically that, unless full compensation is paid for the damage done, he will assemble a force of 5,000 sowars in the autumn and drive the sheikh into the sea. It is asserted on the part of the sheikh that the Bakhtiaris did not evacuate Shuster, but fled on the approach of the Arabs, carrying away with them a sum of 5.000 tomans (1,000b) belonging to the sheikh’s adherents in the town. It is granted that a part of the lands of Akili was destroyed, but it is claimed that this was done in direct opposition to the sheikh’s orders, and it is thought that he will probably make the losses good to the villagers, such being his custom on these raiding occasions, but that he would do so out of the 5,000 tomans (1,000b) carried off by the Bakhtiaris from Shuster. It would appear that the sheikh is also dissatisfied with his British advisers, because, but for them, he would have loosed his Arabs on the surrounding Bakhtiari country at a moment when all the odds were in his favour. Such is, as far as my information goes, the present somewhat complicated situation. It is far from easy to get at the true facts of the case even with the impartial assistance of His Majesty’s consular officers on the spot, as their sources of information ure naturally coloured. Major Haworth understands that the Bakhtiaris did notevacuate Shuster until forced to do so by the approach of an overwhelming Arab force, and that consequently the Bakhtiaris did not, as claimed by the khans, voluntarily carry out their share of the agreement made under the auspices of the Persian Government, Captain Grey has been assured that the main force of the Bakhtiaris had left Shuster before the Arabs appeared, and that only a small body had remained for police purposes. Major Haworth considers that the sheikh would crush the Bakhtiaris by weight of numbers, but Captain Grey thinks that the latter would walk through the Arabs by reason of their superior military qualities. Speculation as to which side would win is vain, as the object we have in view is to prevent the collision which would settle the disputed point. For this purpose we have urged upon the khans during Captain Grey’s visit here that they should agree to a meeting being held in the autumn at some place near Shuster, at which both the sheikh and the Bakhtiaris should be represented by duly authorised persons. Major Haworth and Captain Grey would also attend, and a serious effort would be made to come to a satisfactory settlement of all outstanding questions in the hope that a more or less durable peace may be secured. The khans have declared their willingness to send a duly accredited agent to such a meeting, but they say that their representative could not be given full powers to conclude an arrangement on the spot. He would have to refer the terms of a prospective settlement to Tehran for their consideration and approval. It is proposed that a meeting should be held in the month of December next, and it is calculated that a discussion of all the questions at issue would take at least one month. I have reason to believe that the idea of such a meeting has the full approval of His Majesty’s resident and consul- general at Bushire, who might possibly himself be able to attend at the place of meeting for a short time. I have submitted the suggestion to Sir Percy Cox for his observations, and I would propose, Sir, with your approval, to endeavour to get the khans interested to state in writing their willingness to be represented. I have much hope that such an exchange of views might have the happiest results, but I am further of opinion that it would assist very materially to the maintenance of better relations between the rival parties were it found possible by the Persian Government to keep an impartial Governor-General of Arabistan continuously in residence at Shuster. In such a case his guard should, if possible, be drawn from neither faction. Were this not found feasible, I would suggest that the guard should be composed half of Arabs and half of Bakhtiari sowars, the former of whom should be employed on business connected with the Arab population of the province and the latter on Bakhtiari affairs. It is, of course, understood that neither the dependents of the sheikh nor of the Bakhtiaris should have any share in the administration of the towns of Shuster and Dizful. Many of the past quarrels have been due to the long interregna when, in the absence of the proper Government officials, the sheikh or the Bakhtiaris have been entrusted with the administration of these places. I have put these views before Sir Percy Cox and Major Haworth, and I hope that, if approved by you, Sir, they may furnish a way of arriving at a definite settlement of a situation that contains many unpleasant possibilities, among which would be the total closing of the so-called Bakhtiari road, the only one available to-day for British trade from the south to the north. It will be noticed that there is a great difference between the value of the damage done at Akili as estimated by Sardar Motashem and Major Haworth. The latter is probably thinking of the actual harm done, whereas the Sardar maintains that his villagers have been driven away and will never dare return, thus leaving his fields barren of crops for many years to come. The lands were leased for 1G,0()0 tomans (3,200/.) in 1912. It is very improbable that the Sardar could put a force of 5,000 men in the field, since the entire fighting strength of the Bakhtiaris is only estimated at 8,000 men, of which 2,000 men are actually employed outside their own country at Tehran and Ispahan. At the same time a conflict between the Bakhtiaris and the sheikh might have very far-reaching effects upon the political situation in Persia as well as upon British trade. One thing is certain, and that is that the Bakhtiaris have taken full advantage of their present political position to stock their country with arms and ammunition. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.77 No. 168. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 1.) Sir, _ Tehran, June 14, 1912. MY preceding despatch upon Bakhtiari affairs deals with the question of the relations between this powerful and influential tribe and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. It will be my endeavour in this one to explain the present situation of the road from Ahwaz to Ispahan, which is generally known as the Bakhtiari road, although it is almost equally familiar under the name of the “Lynch” road, due to the fact that its construction was carried out by the firm that is so styled. For some time past^ complaints have been frequent that the Bakhtiari khans responsible were not taking the necessary steps to secure the safety of the road. Representations on the subject were constantly made to the khans in Tehran, who sent repeated instructions to the local khans to take the necessary steps to protect the traffic on the road. Much stress was laid upon the fact that Yusuf Khan, Amir Mujahid, had been appointed Governor of Behbehan, a position which would enable him to control the thieving Kuhgeluis that infest the road at certain times of the year, when the nomad Bakhtiari have moved off to other pastures where water is more plentiful. At a critical moment, when it was most essential that the measures for the control of the Kuhgeluis should be taken, news was received that the Amir Mujahid had not proceeded to Behbehan, and was abandoning his charge because of the opposition of Sardar Ashja, his cousin, who had constituted himself controller of the road, and was behaving in a high-handed manner that was in no sense in accordance with the best interests of the road. Sardar Ashja was until recently Governor-General of Ispahan, where he proved a failure. Hot upon the news of this chief’s behaviour to his cousin came a report that he had also refused to allow Messrs. Lynch’s road inspectors to do their duty, and had sent them back to Ispahan. A protest was at once addressed to the khans by the legation, and Sardar Ashja has been summoned to the capital to explain his conduct. It is said that he is now on his way here, but, meanwhile, the road has been left to the mercy of the Kuhgelui robbers, and there is small doubt that it will be completely closed to trade in a few weeks. The question is now receiving the serious attention of the khans here, and formed the subject of conversation during Captain Grey’s recent visit. After much deliberation they have proposed to Messrs. Lynch’s agent that his firm should advance them a sum of 40,000 tomans (about 7,500b), repayable in five years by instalments, on the plea that they have no funds available for the policing of the road. If the money is forth coming they propose to name Sardar-i-Jang, a brother of the Sardar Ashja, Governor of Behbehan, with full power over the road and the entire Bakhtiari country, and they profess to anticipate a restoration of order under his control. The khans propose to pay the instalments and interest on the loan out of the road tolls, and are prepared to hand over the collection of the tolls to Messrs. Lynch, should they fall into arrear in the payments due on the loan. They declare that if the money is not forthcoming they cannot hold themselves responsible for the safety of the road, because they are without funds for the purpose. Sardar-i-Jang called upon me on the 14th instant. He assured me that he would do his best to guarantee the safety of the road and to restore order throughout the country. He has the reputation of being a plucky man of considerable military acquirements, and to have much force of character and determination, and he impressed me somewhat favourably. In answer to my enquiry as to what had happened to the toffs that have been collected this year, Sardar-i-Jang stated that the money had been spent in bu} 7 ing horses and the necessary equipment for the Bakhtiaris who had been taking part in the recent military operations. I impressed upon Sardar-i-Jang the great importance that His Majesty s Govern ment attach to the road being kept continually open and free of robbers. He assured me that he would put a thousand men on the road if Messrs. Lynch produced the money required for the purpose, but the khans have nothing but their word to offer as security that the money, if forthcoming, will be sp&gt;ent for the purpose for which it is intended. I nnvp WALTER TQWKLEY.Sir W. Towniey to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 1.) T ... . Tehran, June 17, 1912. IN reply to enquiries which I thought it opportune to address to His Majesty’s consular officers at Bushire and Shiraz with regard to the state of security of the main southern roaa during the last few weeks and the prospects of improvement in the near future, I have received telegrams from those places, of which I have the honour to enclose copies. As you, Sir, will observe, although few robberies of importance are reported, yet the difficulties besetting the passage of caravans and travellers on account of blackmail and danger to life and property appear to be on the increase, and neither Mr. Bill nor Mr. Smart can point to any indications of approaching improvements. With regard to the state of the Shiraz-Ispahan section from the 1st April to the 7th June, Mr. Consul-General Grahame telegraphs “ about 400 head of transport arrived at Ispahan from Shiraz on the 28th May ; about 400 left Ispahan for Shiraz on the 7th June, otherwise no caravan traffic. Security on Ispahan-Abadeh section improved. No robberies reported by British firms. Above figures and necessity for strong guard whenever a caravan moves show abnormal condition of road. Contrary to previous custom, incoming muleteers from Shiraz latterly refuse to return south, preferring to work on other roads, a significant symptom.” It will be seen from Messrs. Bill and Smart’s telegrams that Mohammed Ali Khan and two others responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart and his escort, contribute Hrgely to the terrorism exercised on the Bushire-Shiraz section of the road, and that Kawam-ul-Mulk does not feel himself strong enough to seize or coerce these chiefs. In regard to this point I have had no opportunity as yet of bringing further pressure to bear on the Central Government, as the Cabinet crisis referred to in my telegram of the 31st May has been prolonged by the endeavours made to induce Yossuk-ed-Dowleh to remain in office and by the vacillating attitude of this Minister in response. With legard to the tribal situation in the south and the struggle between Soulet- n ari( ^ ^ ie new Ukhani of the Kashgais, I have the honour to enclose copy of the latest communication, dated the^Sth May, I have received on this subject from u r - n G C°. nSL ^ Smart, from which it would appear that Soulet’s forces have dwindled to an insignificant number, but that it will be difficult to run him actually to ground. J 1 hough the tribal migration seems to have taken place without the occurrence or unfortunate incidents at one time anticipated, yet the director of the Indo-European . e e S ra Pp i Department complains bitterly of the wilful damage inflicted on the lines m the Ears province which occasioned serious interruptions and dislocation in the international traffic. A satisfactory feature of the situation in Fars is reported by Mr. Acting Consul bmart (on the 4th June) in the considerable improvement shown in the attitude of the priests towards the British, and on the occasion of the King’s birthday the I m a m Juma ot Jars exchanged compliments with myself. I have, &amp;c. WALTEB TOWNLEY. P.S. Since writing the above His Majesty s consul-general af Ispahan telegraphs that a caravan (of the 28th May) also arrived at Ispahan via Sarhad. W. T. Enclosure 1 in No. 169. Acting Consul Till to Sir IE. Towniey. telegraphic.) Bushire, June 8,' 1912. . i Y complaints for robbery of British goods made here has been for robbery of opium oq Dixon, worth 407, stolen at Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai by Ali Mohammad Kamareji, outlaw, one of those responsible for attack of last December, but it is believed t ere has oeen general pilferage along road from Konar Takhteh ; secondly, there are no indications of improvement, on the contrary the condition of the road has been worse t an ever for caravans and for European travellers, and for British subjects dangerous.79 Bank assistant got up as he had large escort from Shiraz, but he states tofangchis took 7 tomans per mule. German merchant about same date was fired on at Diris and threatened up to Tangi Turkan, having to pay 100 tomans. French travellers in April were fired on and had to pay 40 tomans. Another German merchant arrived few days since had to pay 15 tomans and his wife was insulted at Jafferjin. Indian cavalry camp followers and Baluchi camelmen robbed near Yezd some years ago returned two weeks ago and reported robbery under arms at Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai, one Mohammadan being accused of being Hindu was made to repeat Mohammadan declaration of faith after being taken to village and detained. Others of party were robbed at Jafferiin. Thirdly, rahdari illegal exactions have mounted from 15 to 70 krans per mule in Aprih 1911, and 17 to 95 krans in September, 1911, to 21 and 27 krans in past two months. Tofanghis now extort exactions in more than thirty places, and sugar and tea were recently being heavily pilfered. Muleteers complain bitterly. Fourthly, one of worst features since access to power of Kashkuli chiefs has been their auction of stretches of road to highest bidders and manipulation for their own benefit. Right to fleece and blackmail is now being bought and sold openly. Kashkulis have deflected road to Kadun valley so as to avoid passing through Kazerun. They have entrusted ill-famed caravanserai mentioned to Ali Mohammed who is at enmity with Khan of Kamarej, next stage. Caravans were detained by tribal fighting near Zinian at end of April and beginning of May. Fifthly, in course of last ten weeks only 4,024 mules were recorded during fifty days as entering Bushire and only 1,070 in past eighteen days. This is totally insufficient. Unauthorised Shilf route with its attendant difficulties has also been brought into use again. Hire has now risen to 34 tomans for 770 lbs. from Bushire to Shiraz. Sixthly, caravanserai and Jaflerjin village are worst plague spots on road at present, but unbridled licence prevails and armed men growing more truculent. Enclosure 2 in No. 169. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Toumley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, June 9, 1912. MAIN road Shiraz to Ispahan frontier has been closed to caravan traffic during past ten weeks. At beginning of April Kawam managed to get two French travellers from Yezd frontier to Shiraz safely vH Dehbid. After much negotiation with Khamseh chiefs and delays and with huge escorts, at some stages amounting to 200 tribal riflemen under four chiefs, we have succeeded in getting Maletta and eighteen fourgons loaded with British and native goods to Abadeh in three weeks. They are now hung up there, governor Abadeh considering necessary huge Kashkuli escort regarding which I am negotiating. However, for last ten weeks section Abadeh to Ispahan frontier has been much safer, and Indo-European Telegraph Department inspector was able to go up and down that section inspecting line in safety. Amelioration was probably largely due to brigands deserting road owing to absence of caravans to plunder. Arrival of Kashgais migrated northwards may keep this section open as they block access of Kuhgelus. Caravans and post, however, use now Sarhad route and are likely to do so until winter, when Khamseh tribes leave main road on southward migration. Bushire road is open to caravans, bnt in most unsatisfactory state. Ears Government have just informed me that reversion to main road after Kamarij has been secured, but reports from Kazerun seem to show this announcement premature. Hitherto some caravans to escape ruffianly roadguards, Mohammed Ali Khan’s dependents at Rahdar, scene of attack on our troops, make short cut from Kamarij over precipitous pass to Kazerun via Bardun, this track being at present efficiently guarded by Kurshid Khan of Kamarij and Kalantar of Kazerun, but these caravans north of Kazerun are harassed and blackmailed even more excessively than usual by Kashgar roadguards, who hold road north of Kotali Dukhter, for not having gone by Naudan route. Other caravans which come to Rahdar are there deflected at rifle point by Rahdar roadguards to Naudan route, though occasionally they appear to have been allowed to continue by main road on payment of enormous blackmail. Chief of these Rahdar ruffians is one of culprits wanted tor attacks on our tioops. Kawam in spite of assurances to me has not yet been able to seize or even xernove him from road. All along road Kashgai guards blackmail and harass muleteers beyond endurance, opening and pilfering from cases. Settled population along road are on bad terms with Kashgais, and Khurshid threatens to recover by force Rahdar and Shapur villages seized by Mohammed Ali Khan last summer after Nizam’s wanton aggression [1340] Nagainst Khurshid. If Khurshid could recover those places, Kamarij-Mian Kotal section would improve. He has appealed to me for support. While strongly counselling moderation to Khurshid and his allies among settled population in order to avoid hostilities, which might temporarily close Bushire road altogether, I am urging Kawam in interests of road to satisfy Khurshid’s just demands, and restrain Kashgais from retaliation. Kawam does not, however, feel strong enough yet to coerce powerful Mohammed Ali Khan, who is chief cause of evil. Owing to assistance of Kawam, and personally friendly attitude of Kashkuli Khans towards consulate, I have been able to pass five European travellers up and down Bushire road, but only by entrusting them to tribesmen implicated in attacks on our troops, and with much arrangement and anxiety. Two of these travellers were violently insulted and blackmailed by Bahdar ruffians, who pointed rifles at them, and even fired in air to intimidate them. One robbery of six bales British goods just south of Dastarjin, value 180L, and three instances of petty thefts have been reported to me since the 1st April. All information regarding frequent interruptions of telegraph wires and robberies of Gholams repairing lines can be obtained from director, Tehran. I see little prospect of general improvement on northern section until winter, reduction of Khamseh tribes being at present impossible, and on southern section until arbitrary power of Kashgais over roa.d is moderated. Government of Ears is, in absence of military force, being run with considerable dexterity by tribal combinations. Mohammed Ali Khan and Kashkulis are at present important link in Government tribal combination, and it may be long before Government can dispense with their support, and rearrange Government tribal combination. Enclosure 3 in No. 169. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, May 28, 1912. SOULET rejoined Darashoolis at Baiza and tried to regain their support by taunting them with having been defeated by Kashkulis. Tribe refused to respond, and, Ilkhani having arrived with force, Soulet retreated northwards. Pursuing, Ilkhani caught him up at Duzdkurd, where fighting took place, in which Soulet bolted without making serious stand. He managed to double back southwards, and was reported to be again in Baiza. Two Kashkuli and Farsimedan chiefs, who are stationed permanently in Shiraz, were sent out on the 26th May by Kawam to reconnoitre in Baiza with thirty Farsimedan sowars. They stopped first night at Puzeh Kushan, only 5 miles from town, and during night Soulet unexpectedly appeared with chiefs, say, 200 sowars. Farsimedanis attacked, killing few Souletis and number of horses. Soulet and his escort scattered and fled in the dark towards, it is supposed, Firuzabad. Chiefs told me that they were so close that they heard Soulet’s voice, beseeching his Kashgai assailants nof to fire on him because he had women and children with him. It is not clear why, if his only object was to escape southwards, he chose risky course of passing through outskirts of town. It is thought by many that he intended to make dash for consulate. Soulet, unencumbered by flocks, families, &amp;c., is very mobile, and will hardly be caught by incoherent methods of tribal warfare.

WE have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and to note the wishes of His Majesty s Government with regard to repayment of capital, collection and remittance of interest, and the matter of the security assigned to the advance of 100,000L to the Persian Government on the 28th March last. We have advised the treasurer-general (as per copy of our letter enclosed) of the conditions above referred to, and on the 20th instant we propose to remit the accrued interest from the 28th March if there are sufficient funds to meet requirements ; but, under present circumstances, it does not seem at all likely that there will be, as the receipts of the southern ports are still being utilised by the treasurer-general in total disregard of the various services to which they are specially assigned. WITH regard to the advance of 100,000L made to the Persian Government on the 28th March last, we are now instructed by his Excellency the British Minister to remit to London the monthly interest only, and to waive the matter of repayment of capital 20th instant the accrued interest at 7 per cent, per annum on 100,000L from the 28th March last. AS I had the honour to inform you in my telegram ^ of the 17th June, ^ it has not been possible to make any progress in the negotiations connected with the attack upon Mr. Smart and the withdrawal of the British Indian troops for several weeks. Since the 22nd May there has been a continuous Cabinet crisis, which was only patched up to break out higain. The late Minister for Foreign Affairs was closely connected with this crisis, that occupied his attention to the exclusion of all other subjects, the result being that it was hard to get him to discuss questions even of such moment as the one I am reporting upon. Yossuk-ed-Dowleh has at last definitely resigned and his successor has been appointed. Motashem-es-Sultaneh, the Minister of the Interior, called upon me yesterday. In the course of our conversation - , his Excellency told me that he had at once, upon assuming office, sent for the papers connected with this incident. He had We have, &amp;c. A. 0. WOOD, Chief Manager. Enclosure 3 in No. 171. Imperial Bank of Persia to the Treasurer-General. Sir, Tehran, June 13, 1912. for one year from the date of the advance. In the meantime, it is to be noted that the surplus receipts of the southern customs remain as security for the service of this advance, both as regards interest and capital. We therefore propose to remit on the We have, &amp;c. A. 0. WOOD, Chief Manager. No. 172. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received July 1.) Sir, Tehran, June 18, 1912.seen with pleasure that His Majesty’s Government had, as usual, been animated by genuine feelings of goodwill towards Persia, and had made their conditions as lenient as possible. He had, he assured me, telegraphed to the Deputy Governor of Shiraz to instruct him that the culprits must be arrested. His Excellency said that these men are not with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, as Vossuk-ed-Dowleh had told me, hut that they are actively employed in combatting that chieftain under the orders of his brother, the present Ilkhani of the Kashgais. This fact, he had impressed upon the Kawam-ul- Mulk, should not stand in the way of their arrest and dispatch to Shiraz for trial. Motashem-es-Sultaneh added that Mukhber-es-Sultaneb, the Governor-General of Ears, is now making preparations for an early departure for his post, and expressed great hope that his assumption of office would be speedily followed by a marked improvement in local conditions. His Excellency further stated that it would seem that the difficulties between the deputy governor and Major Siefert, the senior Swedish gendarmerie officer, had been overcome, and that special instructions would be given to the Governor-General to assist the Swedish officers in their mission. The Minister’s statement about the present whereabouts of the parties directly responsible for the outrage upon Mr. Smart and his escort is confirmed by latest reports from the acting British consul at Shiraz. It is possible that the new Governor-General, who will be supported by all the Bakhtiari influence, may feel himself strong enough, after he has taken over the government, to take steps to effect the arrest of the chiefs implicated. I shall impress the necessity for such action upon his Excellency before his departure. I will also call his urgent attention to the importance attached by His Majesty's Government to the success of the mission of the Swedish officers, which, it is hoped, will result in the reopening and proper protection of the important trade road between Tehran and Bushire. I propose to speak to Mukhber-es-Sultaneh very seriously upon this subject, because I have reason to believe that the all-powerful Bakhtiari chiefs have not been very genuine in their support of this scheme. Mr. Smart reports that he is continually pressing the chiefs for the surrender of the culprits, but that they plead impotence to do so, because they have all fled to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, or elsewhere out of reach. This was doubtless the excuse made to Yossuk-ed-Dowleh and repeated to me. There seems to be little doubt that the chiefs have not told the truth, but it is Mr. Smart’s opinion that they are unlikely to hand over the culprits except under serious menace. I am afraid that, under these conditions, preparations will have to be made for the troops to remain over the winter, unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to take steps of such a threatening nature as would induce the Persian Government to bring real pressure to bear on the local authorities at Shiraz.

The Begent and Cabinet. —The Regent had originally intended to leave for Europe at the end of May, but a threatened Cabinet crisis and the representations of the British and Russian Ministers caused him to defer his departure for a fortnight.85 On the 3rd June the Cabinet was reconstructed as follows :— Premier, Samsam-es-Sultaneh. Foreign Minister, Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. Minister of War, Sardar Motashem. ,, Interior, Motashem-es-Sultaneh. ,, Finance, Moavin-ed-Dowleh. „ Education, Ala-es-Sultaneh. ,, Justice, Momtaz-ed-Dowleh. ,, Posts and Telegraphs, Mustashar-ed-Dowleh. The Regent Left Tehran on his way to Europe on the 11th June, but in the meantime \ ossuk-ed-Dowleh resigned the post of Foreign Minister, declaring that he could not work in harmony with the Bakhtiari Premier. 1 he Treasurer-General. M. Mornard was confirmed as treasurer-general and given a five years’ contract in that capacity on the 10th June. The Democratic Party- As reported in the last summary, a number of the leaders of the Democratic party were arrested and deported. Wahid-ul-Mulk and Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab have now left for Europe, and the Democratic party may now be said to be broken up at Tehran for the present. The Medjliss. There are no signs for the present of elections taking place in the near future for a new Medjliss. Yepnm Khan. The notorious Armenian chief of police and leader of volunteers, who was shot by the enemy near Hamadan on the 19th May, had rendered the Government -incalculable service during the last two years, and it will be difficult to replace him. The body was brought to Tehran for interment. The Kings Birthday.—Ris Majesty’s birthday was celebrated in the usual manner on the 3rd June. In the morning a deputation from the Shah and Government was received by His Majesty’s Minister in uniform; in the afternoon the British colony, Persian notables, and diplomatic corps attended a garden party at the legation, and in the evening an official dinner was given to the Cabinet and the principal members of the colony. Caspian Provinces. During the first week in June an engagement took place near Ardebil between Russian troops and some Shahsevan marauders, who had been pillaging the villages in the neighbourhood. The Russians had thirty casualties, including two officers killed. The Russian vice-consul at Ardebil asked for reinforcements, and six companies of infantry were sent from Resht on the 6th June, leaving two companies of infantry and 300 Cossacks at Enzeli and Resht. In Talish the Russians have taken no further steps since the withdrawal of their punitive force at the commencement of last month. His Highness the Regent left Enzeli on the 13th June on board a Russian gun-boat. Meshed. The general insecurity in the province continues, and several Afghan and Berberi landowners are said to be selling their property and migrating into Afghanistan. Yusuf Khan, Herati, was captured by Persians near Fariman, 40 miles south of Meshed, and brought to Turuk, 8 miles from Meshed, where he was shot. On the following day, the 24th May, his body w r as brought into the town and exhibited to the populace. The head of the mosque of Gauhar Shah left Meshed at the end of May to pay a visit to the ex-Shah at Odessa. Neiir-ed-Dowleh, the new Governor of Khorassan, arrived at Meshed on the 5th June. Ispahan. The province is in its usual unsettled state, especially the Sultanabad district, where the postal service has been at a standstill since the beginning of June owing to the roads being infested by robbers. The general distress in the town has increased, chiefiy on account of a corner in grain made by the governor and some of his friends.His Excellency, ignoring the authority of the agent to the treasurer-general, has commenced collecting the revenue himself, and is inciting taxpayers to resist the efforts of the Treasury gendarmes to collect taxes. Yezd. The province continues to be overrun by partie? of robbers, as the governor has no adequate force at his disposal for the maintenance of order. The Arabs, reported in last month’s summary as advancing on Yezd, have broken up into small parties and commenced plundering the district. The Baharlus, who captured the hamlet of Shehr-i-Babek, were dislodged by a force under the governor of that place. But, as the Government force was not strong enough to break up the gathering, other villages in the neighbourhood are suffering. On the 7th June Entezam-ul-Mulk, formerly Governor of Yezd but now a reactionary, raided Ardistan, but was dissuaded from plundering the town by the chief priest, who bribed him with a mare and a Lebel rifle. According to latest reports, he is being followed up by a party of Government troops. Shiraz. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, since his defeat at the hands of the Arabs and Kashgais, has been a fugitive in the hilly country around Shiraz. Parties of his pursuers came up with him twice last month, but he managed to escape on both occasions. Kerman. On the 17th May Amir-i-Azam, the governor, owing to the near approach of the rebels, forsook his post and took refuge in the consulate. He was, however, persuaded to return to the city and to carry out the duties his position demanded. On the 26th he attacked the rebels, with the result that they left the precincts of the town and moved into the Bardsir district to the south-west of Kerman. After some hesitation, Amir-i-Azam was induced to follow up the rebels. On the 8th June he was reported to have reached Baghin (30 miles south-west of Kerman) with a force of 1,000 men. Kermanshdh. On the 19th May the Government force, under Yeprim, attacked and defeated the rebels under Mujallal-es-Sultan, near Hamadan. Mujallal is reported to have had some 300 casualties, including 120 prisoners. The Government losses were 30 killed and wounded. Yeprim was killed during the fighting, and Kerri, an Armenian, Yeprim’s second in command, took his place. The Government troops followed up the retreating rebel force, and on the 29th May another engagement took place close to Kermanshah, in which Daoud Khan, the leading Kalhur chief and one of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s principal supporters, was killed. On the following day the Government troops, with Prince Farman Farma, the newly appointed Governor of Kermanshah, entered the town. • Salar-ed-Dowleh and MujallaTes-Sultan are reported to have fled into Luristan. Bushire. The plague in the district is reported to be getting worse, and an exodus has commenced from Bushire itself owing to the prevalence of the disease. Telegraphic communication with Ahwaz has been interrupted since the 29th May, when 4 miles of wire and posts were carried off in the vicinity of Behbehan by some of the local tribesmen. Bunder Abbas. The party of raiders, mentioned in last month’s summary, increased by local contingents to some 500 men, advanced their main body to within 8 miles of the town on the 15th May, and pushed forward an advanced party of about 70 men to some wells 2 miles from the consulate. On the morning of the 15th the consular guard drove off the advanced party of the raiders. The same afternoon, in view of possible developments, the senior naval87 officer landed 1^0 men and 4 Maxims from the ships, and on the 17th 30 men and 1 Maxim from the 7th Rajputs. The raiders, disheartened by the arrival of these reinforcements, dispersed. On the 19th May the troops were re-embarked. No. 174. Sir W ,. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received July 1.) Sib . Tehran, June 18, 1912. IN bis telegram of the 5th March' A ' my predecessor had the honour to repeat to you a telegram received from Mr. Acting Consul Smart reporting the interference and petty robberies to which certain cases destined for His Majesty’s troops at Shiraz had been subjected on the road from Bushire to the interior in January and February last. No details as to the nature and value of the articles stolen had been received from Mr. Smart until the arrival on the 14th June of the despatch of which I enclose an extract, and consequently no claim has yet been made by the legation to the Central Government in regard to this matter. It now appears that the value of the articles, viz., 200L is much larger than had been anticipated by the tenour of Mr. Smart’s original telegram. It is to be noted that Colonel Douglas has asked the Indian authorities to refund to him the amount, pending recovery from the Persian Government, in order that the officers and men should not suffer hardship. I have requested Mr. Smart to furnish me with fuller details in regard to the nature of the articles stolen. 1 have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. June 20, 1912. P.S.—Since writing the above I have received a telegram from Mr. Smart in which be states that the articles extracted from the cases comprise binoculars, stirrups, boots, blankets, reins, supplies despatched to the supply and transport officer, Shiraz, and a consignment of clothes addressed to Lieutenant Fraser of the Central India Horse. Mr. Smart adds that it has been impossible to ascertain all the points on the road at which the cases were opened, though Khurshid Khan of Kamarej, and Tofangchisat Tangi-Turkan and Rahdar appear to have been the principal offenders. W. T. Enclosure 1 in No. 174. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (Extract.) I VENTURE to invite your attention more especially to claim No. 112. The circumstances of this robbery, or rather of these robberies, were of a peculiarly aggravated nature. Colonel Douglas has, I understand, asked the competent Indian authorities to refund to him the amount of this claim pending recovery from the Persian Government. The officers and men of the Central India Horse are, I submit, in a privileged position regarding such robberies, and it would seem inequitable to expect them to suffer, apart from the hardships entailed from the depiivation of very necessaiy articles, heavy pecuniary loss for the indefinite period which seems to stretch befoie ordinary British claimants in Pars. I venture to hope, therefoie, that you will be able to bring this claim to the notice of the Persian Government with a view to a less remote settlement than that in prospect for most of our claims in this piovince. ^ I may mention that a further series of petty robberies, similar to those included m claim No. 112, from consignments sent from Bushire to the Cential India Horse has occurred during the last month, and, in the event of my being unable to settle these claims locally, I shall include them in my next quarterly list.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 1.) Sir, Tehran, June 18, 1912. I HAVE had the honour to receive your despatch of the 4th June respecting the Bakhtiari road and the repair by Messrs. Lynch of the Godar Bridge. Messrs. Lynch’s engineer, Mr. Sotham, has returned to Tehran from the Bakhtiari country, having repaired the bridge sufficiently to prevent its collapse for at least twelve months. He was not able to complete the repairs satisfactorily, owing to the unsettled state of the Bakhtiari country and in a great measure to the unfriendly attitude of Sardar Ashja, one of the principal khans who has already been the subject of strong complaints on the part of the legation. I have not failed to represent the gravity of the situation to the khans at Tehran, and I have again complained very seriously of Sardar Ashja, who has now been summoned to Tehran. But in view of the fact that the principal khans are engaged in Tehran and elsewhere in Ministerial posts and as provincial governors, I see very little prospect of their being in a position in the near future to deal effectively with the situation in their own country. I wall of course continue to press them to take effective measures to keep their people and the Kuhgelus in order, but I cannot entertain much hope, if the present conditions continue, of seeing any appreciable improvement in the near future. I have, &amp;e. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 176. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 1.) Sir, Tehran, June 20, 1912. ^AS I had the honour to report in my telegram of the 17th May, the situation at Kerman suddenly took a turn for the worse on the 17th May, and the Governor- General took refuge in His Majesty’s consulate. As a result, however, of a lengthy telegraphic conversation in the middle of the night with his Excellency and Colonel Haig, I was successful in persuading the former to return home and resume his duties. A few days later, his Excellency attacked the rebels—fortunate^ with success; he defeated the rebels, though Colonel Haig considers that a more complete success would have been obtained had his Excellency attacked them a few days previously. Ihe rebels, though put to flight, were not dispersed ; his Excellency preferred, however, not to pursue them, but to wait in the hope of a split in the rebels’ camp, which active measures on his part would doubtless have accelerated. My latest information is that he has now captured Mirza Hussein Khan and Rifat-i-Nizam, the leaders of the rebels, and that the remainder have submitted. The above-mentioned leaders have been hanged. When it is considered that these men had ^ no grievance whatever except that the Governor-General had issued orders forbidding them to rob, and calculated to deprive them of the chance of doing so, that they were the originators of the late movement, and have caused much misery in the89 province, and lieavy loss to tlie Government, that they resisted the Governor-General in arms, and remained in arms after having been warned by the authorities that the Government would regard them as rebels unless they dispersed, their execution seems justifiable and necessary as a warning to others that such movements against the local authorities cannot be undertaken with impunity. In the case of Rifat-i-Nizam, it is not the first time that he has rebelled against the Government. Three years ago, he marched on Keiman, and reached Mahun before his force was defeated and dispersed. It is, unfortunately, necessary in the present distracted state of the country that such examples should be made ; very reluctantly, I cannot but approve the Governor- General’s determination which was taken without seeking my advice. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 177. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received July 1.) Sir, Tehran, June 20, 1912. I MUCH regret to have to state that it has not been found possible to make any progress with the consideration of the conditions under which a loan could be made to Persia under reasonable conditions. M. Poklewsky and I have repeatedly pressed M. Mornard to go more carefully into the nature of the revenues that may still be available as securities for such a loan, as it is obvious that the statement submitted to you, Sir, in Sir George Barclay’s despatch of the 9th March does not provide sufficient security out of the assured available revenue for a loan of the magnitude of the one projected, despite the fact that M. Mornard expressed his opinion in the above-mentioned statement that the 1,819,000 tomans available should suffice for the issue of a loan of 33,000,000 tomans, or about 6,000,000Z. Both the managers of the Imperial and Russian Banks and M. Poklewsky share my opinion that this sum would be quite insufficient for the purpose of a security, and M. Mornard has been told that an available income of 3,000,000 tomans would be required before we could support a contention that the assured annual revenues of the country are sufficient to meet a loan of 6,000,000k The treasurer-general has not so far been able to furnish us with the data required. We have discussed the question of the possibility of judicial reforms and of an alteration of the laws governing the rights of foreigners to hold real estate in Persia, and to accept it as security for loans, with the Regent. His Highness gave it as his opinion that a reform in the nature of an improvement of judicial procedure and of the execution of judicial decrees would be both possible and desirable. On his departure for Europe he included this question in a ^memo- randum of instructions which he left to the Cabinet for their guidance during his sojourn in Europe. The question of land tenure would appear to be a more difficult one, as the Regent pointed out that a European holding real estate in Persia would be not only outside the power of the Persian judicial jurisdiction himself as concerned his estate, but that it would also be held that all the persons employed on such estate are outside Persian judicial jurisdiction. Turkish subjects can hold real estate by virtue of an arrange ment by which the consular authorities are divested of pow T er of interference, but such an arrangement would hardly recommend itself to a European Christian Power. Naib-es-Sultaneh seemed to favour the view that it would be better to leave matters in this respect as they are, as under existing conditions real estate is accepted by the hanks and such institutions as security for mortgages, and many Russian and British Indian Mussulmans do hold landed property despite the law to the contrary. I would respectfully venture to request that these impressions may be accepted as merely the result of primary enquiries, as it has not yet been possible to go more fully into the matter in consequence of the uncertainty which was foi some time attached to the life of the late administration. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. 1340 O 2 [1340]Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 2.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 1, 191 2. A NOTE has been addressed by the Russian Minister to the Persian Government in which the departure of the Sipahdar is rendered conditional on the formation at Tabriz of a force of Persian Cossacks, commanded by two Russian officers and four non-commissioned officers. The maintenance of the force, which is to be 700 strong, is to be charged to the revenues of the province. According to M. Poklewsky an arrangement was made with the Regent and the late Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vossuk-ed-Dowleh, that the arrival of the Sipahdar at Tabriz and the creation of the above force should coincide in point of time. The proximate increase in the Tehran brigade, as recently proposed, will, according to the terms of the note, be in no way affected. A favourable reply, in which the Persian Government will express their hope of of the early withdrawal of the Russian forces now in occupation of Azerbaijan, has been promised in the near future, though it is to be foreseen that a delay may arise through the postponement of the Sipahdar s departure. No. 179. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 2.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 1, 1912. MY telegram of the 17th June. M. Poklewsky informs me that the Russian general has been obliged to leave only a very small force at Ardebil in order to free his troops for the operations against the Shahsevans. To ensure the safety of this garrison he has deemed it imperative to station it in the citadel, which he describes as unoccupied. Russian troops will only remain temporarily in the citadel, and will not hoist the Russian flag. This act of Russian general is looked upon by Persian Government as a gross violation of the sovereignty of Persia, as they maintain that the citadel is the seat of the Government of the town. They also state that Shuja has imprisoned and deported the karguzar, on whom the only blame that can be laid is that he was endeavouring to bring about a peaceful settlement with the Shahsevans.

The ilkhani has informed Kawam that he has abandoned all hope of persuading Mohammed Ali Khan to hand over of his own free will the persons guilty of the attacks on our troops. I discussed the situation yesterday at length with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I reminded him that His Majesty’s Government were anxious to learn whether the Persian Government had done anything to secure redress, and if so what the nature of their action had been. In reply, his Highness assured me that the matter had been pressed upon the authorities of Tars repeatedly by the Central Government, but the latter were not in a position to make their power felt so far from the capital at the present unhappy moment; he felt sure His Majesty’s Government must recognise this. He assured me that full powers and instructions to deal drastically with this question would be given to the new Governor-General, who would start in a few days. He said that he was confident that the new Governor-General would succeed in arresting the culprits. He added that special instructions would be given the new Governor-General to support the Swedish gendarmerie officers, and he urged that His Majesty’s Govern-91 niGnt should tho Governor-General time to prove his redress. capability of securing • Though the desired telegram from the Nejef Ulemas has never been published at Shiraz, the i mister foi Foreign Affairs informs me officially that it was duly sent.

Mr. Stevens adds that Salar-ed- Dowleh is expected to arrive there shortly, and that his lieutenant, Mujallal, has already taken bast there. Salar is reported to be at Sakkis, in Kurdistan, but Persian Government pretend that they place no credence in the report. They say however that Gieir latest information is that the Kajar factions have accepted Salar as their candidate tor the throne. Under existing conditions the presence of Sipahdar in the capital is, in my opinion a standing danger to the public peace. No. 182. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 3.) Tehran, July 3, 1912. (Telegraphic.) ACTIVITY of the ex-Shah. My telegram of yesterday. The chef de cabinet of the Foreign Office called on me this morning on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express the anxiety the Persian Government felt at the recent news of the movements of the ex-Shah and his supporters at Tabriz, begging me to bring to the notice of His Majesty’s Government the extreme gravity of the situation, which, in the opinion of the Ala-es-Sultaneh, would be followed by the grayest consequences for Persia should Mohammed Ali Mirza succeed in setting foot again m Persia. The presence of Shuja at Tabriz, of his brother at Zenjan, and of Farman Farma, of whose fidelity there is some doubt, at Kermanshah would seem to argue carefully concerted action for the reception of the ex-Shah, whilst it is expected that Gilan, Mazanderan, and Khorassan would throw in their lot with the Royalists. The gravity of the situation is further aggravated, as Ala-es-Sultaneh points out, by the fact that the resources of the Persian Government in arms and specie are considerably weaker than they were last year. The Minister is anxious that His Majesty's Government should do their utmost to prevent the return of Mohammed Ali Mirza, and enquired if the attitude of His Majesty’s Government with regard to this question remains the same as publicly expressed in the past. He spoke very earnestly on the desirability of expediting the departure of the Sipahdar for his post. In reply, I stated that I had no reason for supposing that the views of His Majesty’s Government had undergone any alteration, and assured him that I would lose no time in conveying to you the purport of his communication.

MY despatch of the 20th instant, which left here by bag the same day, will show you what is the present situation at Kerman and the steps leading up to the defeat and dispersal of the rebels. I now have the honour to forward to you herewith copies of two interesting despatches which I have received from Colonel Haig, in which he reviews the origin of the rebellion and its progress up to the 22nd May. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 186. Consul Haig to Sir W. Townley. Sir, _ Kerman, May 15, 1912. I HAVE the honour to acquaint you with the origin and progress of the rising against the Governor-General of Kerman and Baluchistan which has, for the past fort night, been causing grave anxiety among most classes in the city of Kerman. 2. When Amir-i-Azam, in December last, came to Kerman as Governor-General he was accompanied by Mirza Hussein Khan who had formerly been chief of police in Kerman, and was returning with a view to being reinstated in that appointment, for which, I understand, he had been recommended to Amir-i-Azam by the Minister of93 the Interior. It was discovered, however, that he had made so many enemies in the town during his previous tenure of the appointment, that it was undesirable to reinstate him, he remained for a short time witnout definite employment until he was appointed Governer of Bam. Ihe people of Bam, having heard of his violence and rapacity, telegraphed to the Governor-General protesting against the appointment, which was conceded in consequence of the protest. Mirza Hussein Khan was, however, sent to Bam as a mamur, or deputy, of the Governor-General to restore order in the town and its neighbourhood. While he was there Amir-i-Azam associated him with Pdfaat-i-Nizam for the performance of an important duty. The two were to collect all the troops, regular and irregular, that could be assembled, and were to march through Narmashir, Jiruft, Kndbar, Akta-i-Afshar, and Sirjan for the purpose of restoring order and collecting all arrears of revenue, returning from the last-named district to Kerman. They left Bam for Narmashir early in March 1912 with a large force of infantry and cavalry and two guns. 3. The selection^ of these two men for a duty of this nature was most unfortunate. Mirza Hussein Khan’s sole merit is physical courage. In other respects he is totally unfitted for employment in any position of responsibility. Many have told me that they warned Amir-i-Azam of the folly of entrusting any important duty to Mirza Hussein, and especially of placing guns at his disposal, but the warning had no effect. Bifaat-i- Nizam is a man with an overweening idea of his own importance. His personal history is well known. Without possessing the advantages of good birth or wealth, he obtained some notoriety and influence in Bam when the constitution was first granted as a protagonist and expounder of constitutional principles. He has suffered some vicissitudes, but has recently recovered his former influence in Bam and has used it for his own selfish ends. He was innocently recommended for responsible employment to Amir-i-Azam by Hadji Itibar-us-Sultaneh, whose father has been well served by Kifaatd-Nizam’s father, and whose opinion of Bifaat-i-Nizam was coloured by this claim on his good offices. 4. As soon as Mirza Hussein Khan and Bifat-i-Nizam had entered upon the duty entrusted to them various circumstances caused Amir-i-Azam to modify his original plan of leaving the collection of the revenue of the richest districts of Kerman in their hands. Mohammed Khan, the largest landowner in Jiruft and formerly governor of that district, came into Kerman and persuaded Amir-i-Azam to reinstate him in his former appointment, promising to collect all arrears of revenue without the intervention of Mirza Hussein Khan and Rifaat-i-Nizam. There is every reason to believe that he paid or promised to pay a sum of money for the appointment, and the Minister of Interior has made this transaction a cause of complaint against Amir-i-Azam as though the sale of appointments were unknown in Tehran and were not the custom of the country. Bahadur-ul-Mulk, the dismissed Governor of Jiruft, who has paid no more than one-eighth or one-tenth of the revenue due from him, was much perturbed by Mohammed Khan’s appointment, fearing lest he should be forced to disgorge the revenue which he had already appropriated. At the same time Amir-i-Azam changed his attitude towards Zargham-i-Nazam of Rudbar, who had paid no revenue for some time and was to have been attacked by Mirza Hussein Khan and Rifaat-i-Nizam. He sent him a complimentary present intended as a formal recognition of his position as agent for the collection of the revenue in Rudbar. 5. In the meantime Mirza Hussein Khan and Rifaat-i-Nizam had begun their operations in Narmashir by plundering the people, and Amir-i-Azam rebuked them, commanded to restore their spoil to its lawful owners, and informed them that their services would not be required in Jiruft and Rudbar, where other arrangements had been made for the collection of the revenue. Disappointed by the discovery that they were not to be allowed to plunder indiscriminately, and by their exclusion from two districts in which they had expected to reap a rich harvest, they returned an insolent message to Amir-i-Azam bidding him mind his own business. Rebellion was now the only course open to them, and, encouraged by the possession of two guns and the adhesion of Bahadur-ul-Mulk and Muin-i-Divan, ex-Governor of Jabalbariz, who had been punished by the Governor-General, they declared their intention of expelling Amir-i-Azam as an unconstitutional and oppressive governor, and marched towards Kerman through Jabalbariz and Jiruft, plundering the country on their way on the pretext of collecting the revenue and supplies for the constitutional force. _ The property of Mohammed Khan of Jiruft was placed under contribution, and he himself was forced to join the rebels, as his men were dispersed and he had no force with him beyond two mounted personal attendants. Zargham-i-Nizam of Rudbar, though nominally loyal, judged it pendent to conciliate the rebels by sending a small force to co-operate with them, but refrained from joining them m person. In Jiruft the tebels captured Haidei Khan,Amir-i-Azam’s farrashbtshi, and twenty or thirty men who had been sent with him to collect revenue. Haider Khan has been released, but the other prisoners are still detained by the rebels. From Jiruft the whole force proceeded to Baft, where Bahadur-ul-Mulk’s influence induced the two sections of the Afshars under their chiefs, Qhunj Ali Khan and Soulet-ul-Mulk to join it. The Buchakchis, under Shukuh-us- Sultan and Shuja-us-Sultan, also joined the movement, and as this tribe is at enmity with the Afshars, and will never in ordinary circumstances work with them, there can be little doubt that they are acting at the instigation of Sardar-i-Nusrat, who was accompanied to Tehran by Bahman Agha, a Buchakchi, who has sent several telegrams in cypher from Tehran to the chiefs of his tribe. The rebels, whose number, at first greatly exaggerated, appears to be 800 or 1,000, did much damage in the neighbour hood of Baft, plundering the people and cutting the green crops for fodder. The property of the karguzar in and around Lalazar was laid waste, and two of his men were killed. They advanced into the Bardsir district, where they plundered the villages belonging to Prince Farman Farma, and announced their intention of advancing immediately on Kerman. Amir-i-Azam, who had less than a hundred trustworthy troops to oppose to them, was much terrified by the prospect of their advance, and prepared for flight by packing up his portable property and drawing his money out of the bank. I did my utmost to reassure him and to prevail on him to remain, and wrote a letter to the rebels warning them of the responsibility which they would incur should they enter Kerman, where their troops and followers would certainly plunder the people, for the purpose of expelling a Governor-General who, whatever opinion they might entertain of his measures, had been lawfully appointed by the Persian Govern ment, and was entitled to the obedience of all loyal subjects of Persia until he should be dismissed by the same authority. This letter was signed by the acting Russian consul as well as by me, and I also wrote letters to the chiefs of the two tribes warning them of the risk which they incurred by associating themselves in such a cause with two men without a stake in the country who, in the event of the failure of the movement, would disappear and leave those whose homes and lands were in the province to bear the brunt of the Government’s displeasure. To this joint letter the rebels replied by a letter bearing thirty-one seals, in which they disclaimed any intention of disobeying the Government or molesting the people of Kerman, and said that their sole object was to petition the Government with a view to procuring the dismissal of an extortionate and oppressive Governor-General. They requested us at the same time to prevent the Governor-General from opposing their entrance. To this we replied that if their attitude was that of petitioners they should release their prisoners and dismiss their troops, and they answered in a brief letter informing us that they had sent a detailed reply to the karguzar and requesting us in future to address them through that channel, u in accordance with law.’' In their answer addressed to the karguzar they expressed their readiness to obey the “lawful” orders of tne Persian Government, reserving to themselves apparently the right of distinguishing between lawful and unlawful orders, again requested the consuls to prevent the Governor- General from opposing them, and, in particular, from using artillery against them, and concluded by challenging the Governor-General to come out and meet them where they were encamped, about 50 miles from the town. 6. On the 8th May, the Governor-General having withdrawn his money from the bank and assured me positively that he intended to leave on the following morning, the treasure of the Imperial Bank of Persia was transferred to the British consulate, where it is still stored. The Europeans had already been warned that it might be necessary for them to come to the consulate and were prepared to move. Two telegraph lines were run to the consulate in the course of the next two or three days, in case it should be necessary for the telegraph-house to he vacated. On the morning of the 9th May the Governor-General sent for me and I went to the palace, taking my Russian colleague with me. Amir-i-Azam had decided to postpone his departure for a few days, but was still in a state of terror. I again exerted myself to reassure him, and discovered that he was as apprehensive of the party in the town styling themselves “ Democrats ” as of the force in the field. The Democrats, lead by Agha Yahya, late chairman of the local assembly, had been secretly encouraging the rebels to advance and occupy the town, and, as some of them were then present at a meeting which my arrival had interrupted and was assembled in the room next to that in which Amir-i- Azam had received me, he suggested that I should speak to them. He wished me to frighten them by threatening them with the immediate arrival of British troops, but this, of course, I declined to do. I informed them that British subjects and other foreigners were extremely apprehensive of molestation at the hands of the rebels, and95 [1340] P asked them what they proposed to do. I was met with assurance that the people would fight to protect foreigners but derided such promises, pointing out that the rebels were not disciplined troops, but robbers under no proper control, that I knew that many people were preparing to flee from the town with their goods, and that those who remained would, even if they were disposed to fight at all, which might be doubted, have too much to do m defending their own property to be able to devote any attention to the defence of that of foreigners. When the assurance was repeated I insisted that there was only one way to protect the property of foreigners, and that was to keep the robbers out of the town. ^ I ultimately forced the leaders to undertake to do this, and, though I had no faith in the undertaking, I had gamed something by compelling those who enteied into it to stultify themselves and by producing an excellent effect on the courage and spirits of the Governor-General, who for the time gave up all idea of flight. 7. From new r s which I received from the camp of the rebels I was led to hope that they were losing heart and would probably quarrel among themselves or disperse, but this hope has unfortunately not been realised. They have again advanced and have, I hear, to-day reached Baghm, one stage from the town. The town will probably suffer severely at the hands of the rebels, v r ho during their advance have plundered and laid waste the country, have put to death those who have made any attempt to defend their property, and have violated women. I am informed that their leaders, when in their cups, boast of their intention of putting to death the consuls and other Europeans, but disclaim such intentions in their sober moments. I can hardly believe that they will venture to attack the consulates, but I have little expectation that the property of Europeans and Hindus in the town will be safe. The stocks of four carpet firms have been transferred to the consulate, and I propose to invite the Europeans here to-morrow morning. The Hindus have already sought refuge, but I have no means of protecting their property in the town, worth many hundreds of thousands of rupees. 8. I need not at present enter into the merits of the movement against Amir-i-Azam beyond saying that, although he has not been faultless as a governor, he has done nothing to justify a rebellion. The rebels are, I believe, actuated by various motives, but one is common to them all—the hope of plunder. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel. Enclosure 2 in No. 186. Consul Haig to Sir W&gt; Townley. Sir, Kerman, May 22, 1912. IN continuation of my despatch dated the 15th May, 1911, I have the honour to inform you of the progress of the movement against Prince Amir-i-Azam, Governor- General of Kerman and Baluchistan. 2. Between 9 and 10 p.m., on the 16th May, a confidential employe of the Prince, who usually goes by the name of M. Jean, and claims to be a French subject, but is, I believe, an Armenian, came to the consulate and informed me that the Prince was coming almost immediately to take bast in the consulate. As he did not appear within a reasonable time, I left the lights burning for him and went to bed. In the morning I discovered that he had not come during the night, but he arrived before I was out and^ encamped in a large garden adjoining the consulate garden belonging to Nurullah Khan and generally believed to be under the protection of the consulate. He came to see me, and I endeavoured to persuade him to return to the city, again assuring him that I was convinced that his presence there would be sufficient to prevent an attack, but to no purpose. The rebels were then reported to be at Baghm, one stage from Kerman. When it was light I went to see him again, and he announced his intention of resuming his duties, and asked me to go at once into the town and arrange with the karguzai fbi t he assembly of a meeting of the leading men of the city, promising to follow me as soon as I informed him that the meeting was ready to receive him. I was still in the karguzar s house arranging details when news was brought that the Governor-General had passed down the main street with his escort on his way to the citadel. Almost immediately afterwards two of his sowars appeared and asked me to follow him to the Persian telegraph-office, a large and convenient building in the citadel. I did so, and found kirn at work there. We discovered that the first step necessary was the suspension ofBasharat-ul-Mamalik, the recently appointed superintendent of the telegraph-office. This man had been sent by the Persian Government to the rebels to order them to disperse and obey the orders of Government; but we received information, which has since been confirmed by the best authority, that he accepted a bribe of 1,000 tomans from them and promised to work for them. On this evidence I promised Amir-i-Azam to support his demand for Basharat-ul-Mamalik’s dismissal, which is absolutely necessary. 4. The rebels have advanced in the meantime from Baghin to within 2 or 3 fersakh of the town, and on the evening of the 17th I learnt that all the telegraph wires had been cut on both sides, and was informed that the rebels intended to attack the town that night. I did not believe this, but informed all Europeans that if they were alarmed the consulate was open to them, and took necessary precautions. _ Very few accepted my invitation, and no attack was made. On the following morning I again visited the governor, and remained with him during the day. I wrote to the rebels asking them why they had not obeyed the orders of their Government, and why they had damaged the telegraph line. In reply they impudently accused Amir-i-Azam of having caused the line to be cut, and requested me to go out and see them. My messenger informed me that he believed that their object in asking me to visit them was to attempt to induce me to withdraw my support from the Governor-General and transfer it to them, and as I believed that their ignorance of the limitations imposed on me by my office they might encourage themselves and their followers by the hope that such a change of attitude was possible, and suspected that they would try to represent the recent telegram addressed to them by the Minister of the Interior as a forgery by the Governor-General, I considered it advisable to remove all doubt on these two points, and decided to visit them on Sunday. I suggested that the karguzar should accompany me, as he, in his capacity as a Persian official, would be able to assure them of the attitude of the Central Government, and to convey any messages that the Governor- General might wish to send, whilst I should be able to assure them from the information received by me from you that the karguzar s account of the attitude of the Central Government was correct. My proposal that the karguzar should accompany me was accepted, and he assisted me beyond my expectations. I studiously confined myself when all were present to assuring the rebels that as consul of a foreign State I was bound to recognise an official duly appointed by the Persian Government, and no one ventured publicly to suggest that I should change my attitude, although many in private conference with me urged me to do so. It very soon became evident that there was no likelihood of obtaining from the leaders of the rebels a concise statement of their grievances. Those of Mirza Hussein Khan and Bifaat-i-Nizam have already been stated in paragraph 5 of my last despatch ; Muin-i-Divan, late Governor of Jabaltariz, complains that the Governor-General has punished him, but from all accounts that I have heard he deserved his punishment; Bahadur-ul-Mulk resents his dismissal from the governorship of Jiruft, and fears lest he should be called upon to pay the arrears of revenue due him ; Ghunj Ali Khan, Ilkhani of the Afshars, has not paid revenue for three years, and is naturally apprehensive of being called to account; but most of the others confessed that they had no grievance, but had accompanied their friends. I plainly informed them separately and privately that not one of the grievances alleged by them could be advanced either as a ground for the dismissal of the Governor-General or in palliation of their attitude, and some of them then endeavoured to excuse themselves by making vague and unsubstantiated charges of extortion and oppression against Amir-i-Azam. I informed these that I did not believe them, but that whatever the Governor-General might have done, he had not inflicted on the inhabitants of the province one-thousandth part of the misery which the rebels had inflicted. When I asked them in the presence of all why they had cut the telegraph wires, they repeated their assertion that Amir-i-Azam had caused them to be cut, and on my enquiring why he should have done.so foolish a thing, they replied that he had done it in order to prevent them from communicating with Tehran. I then told them that he had no need to cut the wires for that purpose, as he was occupying the tele graph office, and would not allow any telegram to be dispatched until it had received bis approval. This information silenced them for a time, until one suggested that the wires had been cut lest they should communicate with Tehran through the British office, to which I replied by telling them that they knew as well as I did, that no telegram from them would in any circumstances be accepted by the British office. They were again silent for a time, and then suggested that the wires had been cut “ to give them a bad name.” I answered that Amir-i-Azam had complete control of the Persian office, and could more effectively “give them a bad name” by means of telegrams to97 [1340] P 2 Tehran than by cutting ofl a means of communication which it was to his interest to k fP Olf?- lln . s completely silenced them, and Mirza Hussein Khan afterwards admitted to me m private conversation, that he had himself cut the wires. Shortly before sunset, the karguzar and I left the camp and returned to the town, where we informed the Governor-General of what had passed. After some discussion, it was decided that the karguzar and I should go again to the camp on the following day and persuade five of the leaders to return with us under a safe conduct to be given by me, to represent their grievances to Amir-i-Azam. &amp; J . ^ karguzar and I went to the camp and made this proposal to the leaders, but they had evidently realised that it was impossible for them to submit as grievances against the Governor-General, such complaints as they had made to me' and endeavoured to evade the proposal on various pretexts and by means of frivolous suggestions They .urged that, if five of the leaders came in, those who,, remained would not be sufficient to maintain order among the troops, and suggested that,they should send in one representative. I replied that, as each inan seemed to have a distinct cause of complaint, one representative would not suffice, and that five, or at least four, was the smallest number to which Amir-i-Azam would agree. Then, having complained that fi\e of the leadors could not safely leave-the troops, they suggested that all of them, to the number of twelve or thirteen, should come in. To this proposal, which was evidently not serious, I replied by repeating their own objection to sending as many as live,, It was then suggested .that the conference should take plaoe in the consulate, instead of in a tent outside the city as Amir-i-Azam had proposed. I objected to this suggestion as being an insult to the Persian Government, and assured /ithem that they would be as sechfe in the tent as in the consulate, as I promised to ■take them in in safety, to be present throughout the conference, though I should not take part in it, andtto see them; safely to the camp again. It was then proposed that I should hold a sort of court and act as judge beween themselves as plaintiffs and vAmir-kAzam as defendant. T disclaimed jurisdiction, and said that - I could not insult therGovernor-General by entertaining ox making such a suggestion. /They then asked me to guarantee that the conference would lead to a satisfactory settlement,j and I replied that I could not guarantee that it would lead to any settlement at all, though it seemed to me to offer the only chance of arriving at one. They then openly requested me to withdraw my support from the Governor-General and transfer it to them, and I explained the impossibility of such a course, and said that, as they had rejected the only proposal which offered the chance of a peaceful settlement, I must conclude that they did not desire such a settlement, and declined 'to discuss the question further with them. They were most unwilling to let me go, hoping apparently that they might still persuade me to help them, and, fearing that my final withdrawal would alienate those who had been in a manner forced to join them. At length I succeeded in getting away, and discovered that their fears had been realised', l atid'that what I had said in private,to those whom I knew to be lukewarm had had effect. Soulet-us-Sultan and his brother, two Afshar leaders, had preceded me to the city with abodt 200 followers, and I had not driven more than 2 or 3 miles when I saw a body of horse riding after me. I drove on for some distance, and as they came nearer drew aside from the road to let them pass. They were about fifty Afshars, commanded by Sdulet-ul-Mulk ahd accoilipanied by his father-in-law, Mohammed Khan, of Jiruft, an Old friend of mine, and formerly my guest' in the consulate. I welcomed, ahd congratulated him, and he laughingly replied that he could not let me return to the city alone. I drove on with the karguzar and found Amir-i-Azam in the highest spirits talking to the two Afshar leaders who had already arrived. I was present when he received Mohammed Khan and Soulet-ul-Mulk, and left shortly afterwards. 6. The Prince has been hesitating as to attacking the remnant of the rebels. He is now stronger than they are, and if he attacked them would certainly be joined by the Government troops still in their camp ; but he is still hesitating and sending out messages to them. He has to-day, however, informed me that he proposes to attack them to-morrow. 7. I must now explain the circumstances in which I obtained o,000 tomans from the Imperial Bank of Persia for the Governor-General. I had already received your assurance that the money had been, or was about to be, placed at his disposal, ;md I had seen the telegram received by him from the Minister of the Interior, in which he was informed that orders for its payment had been issued to M. Mornard. Up to the time when the telegraph wires were cut no telegram had been received from M. Moinard, and money was urgently needed, for the troops had long been unpaid, and there was everyjikelihood that numbers would desert. It was impossible to say when telegraphiccommunication would be restored. I thereupon officially assured the manager of the hank that orders for the payment of the money had been issued by the Persian Govern ment to the Governor-Genera], and he kindly agreed to pay the money on the Governor- General’s receipt. I drew the money, and am keeping it in my office and paying it out as required on receipts signed by disbursing officers and countersigned by the superin tendent of revenue and the Governor-General. I am following this course in order that money may be available at any hour and on any day. Had it remained in the bank it would have been extremely difficult to obtain money on Fridays or Sundays, or on other days except during the bank’s hours of business. When order is completely restored I propose to return the balance of the money, if any, to the bank, to the credit of the local Government, and to forward an account with vouchers to the local Government through the karguzar. In this matter of the money I have probably exceeded my duty, and have certainly disregarded formalities, but I did not take any action without first being convinced of its necessity, and I am taking every precaution to ensure that the money is properly applied. 8. I trust that I may be in a position next week to inform you of the dispersal or capture of the remainder of the rebels and the complete restoration of order. They have done an enormous amount of mischief, and inflicted much misery on the people of that part of the province through which they have marched and in the imme diate neighbourhood of Kerman, where they are now encamped. On each occasion of my visiting the camp I have been mobbed by wretched villagers, who have declared that they have been stripped of everything that they possessed. I am informed on good authority that the rebels have violated numbers of women, and have shown them selves regardless of the lives of the people. For these reasons, as well as for the recovery of the guns and ammunition which they still retain, prompt action on the part of Amir-i Azam is much to be desired, and I am urging him to take it. In my next despatch I shall explain how the movement, which, so far as its sympathisers in the city of Kerman are concerned, was a protest, not against any misconduct on the part of Amir-i-Azam, but against the retention of any efficient governor in Kerman, reached such formidable dimensions, I am, &amp;c.

Russian Minister subsequently, as soon as instructions reached him from his Government, issued orders that the basti was to be deported to -Russia, and that pending his expulsion he must not be permitted to communicate with his friends at Tabriz. As soon as he has signed an undertaking that he will not return to Persia without the sanction of the Persian Government he will be expelled ; it is expected that this will take place in a day or two. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed himself as satisfied with the steps taken by the Russian Legation in the matter. No. 192. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 12, 1912. AHWAZ road. My telegram of the 23rd June. I have the honour to report the conclusion of an arrangement by the terms of which Sardar Jang will go to the Bakhtiari country with a view to restoring order and guaranteeing security of the road. A son of the Prime Minister will accompany him. The Persian Government and the khans have granted Jang a firman for a period of five years, giving him full powers as Ilkham of the Bakhtian and Go\einoi of Behbehan. The Imperial Bank of Persia has advanced the sum of 8,000^. necessaryto finance the mission; the khans’ shares in the Bakhtiari Oilfields Company form the security for the loan. I think there is good ground to hope that the mission may have satisfactory results, and that the Sardar fully realises the importance of the task entrusted to him. He will leave here in a few days’ time, and at his special request will be accompanied along the road by Captain Gfrey, who is now at Ispahan, and who will await Jang’s arrival there. No. 193.

Russian Legation received the Persian reply yesterday accepting the creation of a Cossack detachment at Tabriz. Sipahdar still loiters here, however, and keeps finding pretexts for not proceeding to his post. It is urged by the Persian Government that the public peace is gravely threatened by his continued presence here ; they state that the adherents of the ex-Shah are constantly in his entourage, and that there is no concealment of the fact. I think that as long as Sipahdar remains here there will be no feeling of security, and that the Government will be seriously hampered in their work. The departure of Sipahdar was one of the conditions which the Minister for Foreign Affairs made when he accepted office.101 No. 196. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 14.)

No answer has yet been received by my Netherlands colleague from his Government with regard to the Persian Government’s application for police officers for Tehran. For the present the Minister of War, a Bakhtiari, is acting as chief of police. I have good reason to think that he will endeavour to secure the appointment of one of the lesser khans to the post; they are discontented, and such an appointment might solve a difficulty. The Russian Minister would probably resent such a step, and I also am of opinion that a Bakhtiari would be undesirable. My Russian colleague complains that the Persian Government are disinclined to arrest certain fedais who have lately returned to Tehran from abroad and who are well known to have taken part in the outrages committed on Russian troops at Tabriz in January last.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

I received a visit this morning from the Minister of Finance. He begged me to bring to your urgent notice the question of an advance by the two Governments, as the Persian Government were in the greatest need of money. He said that their most pressing requirements were for the equipment of an expedition to Luristan, where the Lurs are in open rebellion, and are threatening to menace seriously the State. The troops at Kermanshah, too, are clamouring to come back to Tehran. He said that if the troops evacuated Kermanshah the town would, without any doubt, be reoccupied by Salar-ed-Dowleh, who is still in the neighbourhood. The governor, Farman Farma, would certainly be the first to leave with the troops. According to the Minister of Finance, my Russian colleague has agreed to telegraph to his Government. No. 203. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey .-—(Received July 17.) (Telegraphic.) St. Peter slurgh, July 17, 1912. YOUR telegram of the 16th July. This afternoon I touched upon the subject of Sipahdar in conversation with M. Neratof, who said that so far as he knew the presence of that chief in Tehran was not causing any such grave embarrassment to the Persian Government; in fact, his Excellency apprehended that once Sipahdar were at Tabriz he wonld be a cause of much greater anxiety to them, as his actions would be less under their control. In the opinion of the Russian Government it would have been preferable that Shuja should be kept at Tabriz ; Sipahdar did not inspire them with the same confidence as Shuja, who was far more influential. I observed to his Excellency that the maintenance of order at Tabriz must surely be thoroughly guaranteed by the Russian troops there, to which an increase of 600 men had recently been made (see your telegram of the 16th July). M. Neratof explained, however, that the object of the Russian Government in sending this reinforcement was to punish the Shahsevans, and that it was their desire to avoid any forcible intervention as far as was practically possible. As regards the question whether it would be expedient to bring pressure on Sipahdar to leave Tehran for Tabriz, M. Neratof promised that he would enquire the views of M. Poklewsky.103 No. 204. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.— (Received July 17.) Mohammed All had left lor Tabriz, and observed that apparently His Majesty’s partisans in Persia were hard at work to engineer his return. M.Neratof replied that he had no knowledge whatever of these movements, and said that m his opinion Mohammed Ah could reckon on no serious support to his cause in Persia and therefore would not make the attempt. I observed to his Excellency that it was to be hoped the Russian Government would take all possible precautions to prevent His Majesty travelling across Russia in secret. I added that failing such precautions the accusation might once more be levelled against Russia that she had arranged for Mohammed All’s return to Persia; and the position of His Majesty s Government would in that case be most embarrassing. M. Neratof replied that such precautions could easily be taken if the ex-Shah had not left Odessa ; but if His Majesty were to arrive in Russia from abroad with a false passport and in disguise, to stop him would be a matter of some difficulty. His Excellency is, however, convinced that a repetition of last year’s adventure is most improbable, taking into consideration the grave warnings conveyed to His Majesty at Odessa by the Russian Government. MOHAMMED ALI is still here. I have not been able to ascertain intended date of his departure. HAVE you any information whether Netherland Government are prepared to lend officers for the police at Tehran ? See Tehran telegram of the 16th July.

The telegram to the Shiraz clergy from the Nejef clergy has now, I am assured, been publicly circulated, the chief mujtahid of Shiraz adding a minute on it to explain the document. His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz has represented that it is essential the deputy governor, the Kawam, should attack the turbulent Arab tribes. The Central Government proposed to await the arrival of the Governor-General at his post. Ala-es-Sultaneh has, however, now promised to issue instructions to the Kawam to act as proposed at once. The Central Government also inform me that they will increase the pay of the road guards,between Shiraz and Bushire from 1,000 to 1,400 tomans per month. Ala-es-Sultaneh expresses the hope that the rapacity of the road guards in the matter of the exaction of excessive and illegal tolls may be curbed by this treatment. It appears to me, however, that it is the tidbal chiefs who, by not allowing caravans to pass except on payment of extortionate tolls, are responsible for the behaviour of the road guards. I have pointed this out to Ala-es-Sultaneh. Mohammed Ali Khan has, it appears, informed the Kawam that the summer season is not suitable for carrying out the arrest of the men guilty of the attack on Smart; he says that he is prepared to surrender the culprits, but asks for a delay of two months.

His Majesty’s Government are in a position to advance 50,000L at any moment, as, on receipt of Sir W. Townley’s telegram of the 20th April, they took the necessary steps to have this sum in readiness. Please ask Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it would not be possible for Russian Government to hold the same sum at the immediate disposal of M. Poklewsky, in order that a joint advance of 50,000/. may be made without delay, and the same amount held in reserve. Perhaps, if every other course is impossible, Russian Government would allow Persian Government an overdraft up to 2'5,000Z. at Russian Bank, on the sole condition that the rate of interest charged on the previous advance should be paid on overdraft ?

His intentions are not clear, and it is as yet uncertain whether he will support Salar or the Persian Government.

No. 224. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—-{Eeceived July 29.) Sir, Tehran, July 7, 1912. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of an interesting review by His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan of the insecurity of the trade routes in that province during the March quarter in so far as the trade of the district was thereby affected. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 224. Ispahan Trade Beport for Quarter ending March 1912. Boads, SNOW which lay deep all over the province during the earlier part of January, and a spell of abnormally severe cold at the end of the month, tended to impede transport and retard posts on nearly all the roads, but at the same time drove the tribesmen off them, thus securing a respite from robberies. &gt; With the abatement of the cold at the beginning of February transport conditions, more especially towards the north, improved, but robbers began to reappear on the Shiraz road rendering large escorts necessary for caravans. The improvement on the Tehran, Yezd, and Hamadan roads was maintained throughout February, but the continued presence of robbers on the Shiraz road and the blockage of the Ahwaz road by snow tended to deprive Ispahan of all supplies from the south. At the beginning of March the condition of the Shiraz road became deplorable and continued so till the end of the month. The Hamadan road was for a timedeclared unsafe, and the Tehran roads were not altogether free from incidents. Towards the end of the quarter the material condition of the Ahwaz road began to improve. On the 10th February Major Carl Petersen, instructor, a Swedish officer charged with the preliminary organisation of the Treasury gendarmerie in Fars, left for Shiraz accompanied by four gendarmes. On the 20th March three other Swedish officers of the same force (Major Siefvert, Major Noren-Brandel, and Captain Mystrom), left Ispahan for the same destination with 150 foot, 30 mounted gendarmes, and 17 waggons of supplies. Ahwaz Road. During January and February, in consequence of the very heavy snow lying on the track, traffic returns were almost nil. Postal kasids who made their way slowly and with difficulty reported the road safe. At the end of February traffic began to revive, but the amount of merchandise received from and dispatched to Ahwaz during March was relatively small. Incoming caravans reported well as to the security of the road in general, but towards the end of March some robberies—apparently of a petty nature— were notified to have occurred at or near the Gav Peeseh Pass (Ispahan territory). Snow continued to be the main obstacle to traffic. The execution of repairs during I ebruary-March to the bridge at Goudar-i-Balutak by Messrs. Lynch’s engineer also tended in a measure to minimise traffic. According to a report from Messrs. Lynch’s road inspector at Dehdiz dated the 2nd March the khans were at that date contemplating the construction of six forts for the better security of the hill sections, viz., at Sareh Eak, Kalaa’ Madrisseh, Balout Buland, Lujamgir, Shalil (two), and arrangements were being made for the appointment and payment through Messrs. Lynch’s inspector of 200 guards to patrol the road. Shiraz Road. In the first week of January local traders, encouraged by the temporary immunity of the road from robbers—the result of the severe weather conditions—dispatched several caravans to Shiraz for supplies of groceries. The news of an attack near Burj-i- Gardan Gir (P ars boundary) by Sarhadis on the postal waggon on the 14th January, when all the mails were reported completely destroyed and the four postal horses carried off, served to check further dispatch. About the 20th January caravans began to arrive from Shiraz, and continued to do so in fairly large number during the next ten or fifteen days. Large caravans with local produce left. Ispahan for the south at the end of January and beginning of February. Simultaneously with this revival of traffic bands of robbers began to reappear on the road. One ot these (said to be Mahyaris) attacked an Ispahan caravan on the 5th February near Kalaa’ Ahmedabad, another (said to be Kuhgelus) seized and for several days occupied the tower between Yezdikhast and Shulgistan, thus arresting for a time further movement of caravans. Noi thward bound caravans which had reached Abadeh m safety experienced a long delay there and considerable difficulties about obtaining local guards. Nor was the presence of these always a sufficient deterrent. Thus on the 23rd February a large caravan under a special escort from Abadeh was attacked near the Yezdikhast tower by a band of some sixty Kuhgelus, which, however, was repulsed. About the same time a party ot Persian merchants and a pilgrim caravan were attacked at Kalaa Ahmedabad just south ot the Orchim Pass and robbed, one nilorim being killed. 1 5 South of Abadeh Baser! tribesmen were reported looting.caravans and villagers. As the season advanced the condition of the Shiraz road became markedly worse. At the end of February reports showed the road immediately north and south of Yezdikhast held by armed bands. During the first week m March a large caravan, chiefly of British goods, was attacked by Boir Ahmedis just north of Abadeh, and about sixty camel-loads pioperty of a British firm carried off; a large caravan of local produce from Ispahan for the south was attacked near Kumisheh by a band of Sarhadis, Kuhgelus, and Nafars, who also raided the flocks of that place; a post and three Persian travellers were looted at the Orchini Pass by Kuhgelus, who held a large tract of the road immediately south of that pass in force. These Kuhgelu bands harried the villages near the road, and did not hesitate totmrnaammmam 109 molest parties of Bakhtiaris between Ispahan and Kumisheh, on one occasion attacking: the Bakhtian deputy governor of that place. To keep them in check the Governor- General of Ispahan found himself obliged to station a small force of Bakhtiaris permanently at Mahyar. The continued presence of these tribesmen throughout March, both in the neighbour hood of Abadeh and m that oi the Orchini Pass, served to minimise caravan traffic, the only movement of importance during the month being the arrival on the 22nd-23rd March of caravans, said to number 600 to 700 head of transport, which came up from Shiraz immediately in the wake of a British consular officer (Mr. Knox) and under the protection afforded by the special escort provided for him by the Persian authorities. Tehran Toad. At the beginning of January, owing partly to heavy snows, partly to the lack of horses at the post-houses, Ispahan was practically cut off from communication with Tehran except by telegraph. A protest was made by the Bussian and British consulates to their respective legations regarding the continued interruption of postal communication with the north. The reappearance near Ardistan of the noted outlaw, Naib Hussein, tended still further to disorganise the postal service, but confidence was restored by the report that an amicable arrangement had been concluded between the Persian Government and Naib Hussein and considerable quantities of local produce destined for the north, which had been held over in Ispahan for some time for fear of the outlaw, began to find dispatch in the latter part of January. Very severe cold, however, at the end of the month again checked all traffic, and the partial occupation of Kashan by the Naib and his men in the first days of February raised some suspicions. A change in the weather and the appointment of Naib Hussein to the governorship of Natanz stimulated traffic and heartened the authorities to replace post-horses on the Kashan-Ispahan tract. Throughout the remainder of February and the first half of March the road was in fairly good condition, caravan traffic normal, and postal communications improved. A robbery which occurred on the 17th March near Gandiabad on the caravan road to Tehran, when eight loads of merchandise property of the Russian Banque des Prets were carried off and reports of excesses by parties of Bakhtiaries on the postal road in the neighbourhood of Kum, caused a falling off in traffic and some disorganisation of postal service during the latter half of March. Yezd Road. Throughout January this road was reported safe, but weather conditions reduced caravan traffic to a, minimum and retarded the posts. With a change in the weather at the beginning of February caravans began to ply freely, and posts to arrive more rapidly. The road throughout the month was reputed safe, but a small caravan which arrived from Yezd on the 2nd March reported that it had been attacked between Nain and Nou Gumbaz by a band of thirty or forty Baseris, who, however, were beaten off by the guards escorting the caravan. During March caravans, posts, and travellers passed over the road without molestations, but towards the end of the month there were rumours of robbers at various points. Incoming caravans during the last week of March dropped their loads and took up others for Yezd a stage or two outside the town to avoid seizure of the pack-animals by the Governor-General for transport of grain from Chahar Mahal to Ispahan. Sultanabad-Kermanshah-Hamadan Roads. These roads throughout January were safe. In spite of very heavy snow and severe cold caravans and travellers continued to pass over them in both directions till the close of the month when the increase of cold checked traffic. A caravan returning empty from Khomai was robbed of money between Tiran and Nejefabad on the 30th January. With the change in the weather at the beginning of February traffic somewhat revived. From the 18th to the 23rd February there were large arrivals of merchandise from Hamadan, and in a lesser degree from Kermanshah. From then till about themiddle of March traffic was maintained, but a warning telegram from Hamadan, and the robbery on the 14th March close to Gulpaigan of the Sultanabad post caused an interruption of caravan traffic. Further reports of the excesses of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s followers in the Kermanshah and neighbouring districts reduced it to nil before the end of the month. No. 225. Sir W.

There seems to be some hope that Sardar Jang will shortly be entrusted with this important mission. With this object in view a loan of 8,0001. at 7 per cent, interest per annum guaranteed by the khans’ shares in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is being arranged for them by the Imperial Bank. Caspian Provinces. On account of the hostile attitude of the Shahsevans, the Russian authorities considered it necessary to take punitive measures against them. With this object, the Russian commander at Ardebil moved the bulk of his force into the district at the end of last month, leaving only a very small detachment behind in the town. On the departure of the movable column this detachment took up its quarters in the citadel. On the 4th July fifty Russian infantry, from the force at Kazvin, left Enzeli for Baku. Meshed. The town and its immediate environs have continued quiet during the last three weeks, but the province is still infested by bands of robbers, especially the Karez, Kuchan, and Abassabad districts. About 100 families are said to have migrated into Afghanistan last month. The Russian garrison at Meshed has been increased lately by the arrival of some sixty recruits from Turkestan,Ill Ispahan. The province is in its normal state of insecurity, and robberies on the Lynch road m Chaharmahal, a district hitherto regarded as comparatively secure, are reported. The state of affairs m the town and environs continues to be unsatisfactory, owing to the dearness of foodstuffs and to the constant petty affrays between the governor’s following and t e tieasuiy gendarmes. There is also a certain amount of uneasiness among the Jewish community, caused by the apparently motiveless murder of two of their race in one of the suburbs of the town. General Malletta, who some two years ago was sent by the Persian Government to Shiraz to raise a corps of gendarmerie for Pars, passed through Ispahan on the 16th June en route to Tehran. Yezd. There has been no improvement in the situation in the Yezd district during the past few weeks. In spite of the efforts of the Kawam of Shiraz to induce the local Arab chiefs to turn back marauders from Yezd territory, villages within ten miles of the town have been pillaged, and caravans, including that of Dr. Carr of the Church Missionary Society (medical mission), robbed. The governor is strengthening the defences of the town and is making such arrangements for its protection as the means at his disposal permit. Entezam-ul-Mulk, who raided Ardistan on the 7th June, was attacked by a force of Bakhtiaris a few days later and compelled to retire into the Biabanak hills. Naib Hussein, the Governor of Natanz, on being asked to co-operate with the Bakhtiaris against Entezam-ul-Mulk, dispatched 200 sowars to Ardistan. These sowars, however, instead of assisting the Bakhtiaris, plundered the bouses in the town and returned to Natanz with the booty. The Bakhtiaris returned to Ardistan, and Entezam-ul-Mulk and his following still remain at large. Kerman. Amir-i-Azam, the Governor of Kerman, followed up the rebels who had been threatening the town at the beginning of last month into the Bardsir district and dispersed them. Rafat-i-Nizam and Mirza Hussein Khan, two of the rebel leaders who took refuge with the local tribesmen, were handed over to the governor and hanged by his Excellency’s orders. Kermanshah. Since the arrival of Prince Farm an Farma, there have been no disturbances in the town ; but the outlying district remains unsettled, as no measures are being taken against the remnants of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s followers, who still hold several of the villages in the neighbourhood. No. 226. Sir W. Toivnley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) Sir, Tehran, July 9, 1912. ON the 24th June the Cabinet and the corps diplomatique were invited to the formal opening of the gendarmerie school at Yusufabad. The school consists of an officers’ college and a depot for training non-commis sioned officers for the Tehran and Kazvin commands (see my despatch of the 30th April, 1912). About 400 men were present on parade, and the manner in which the various exercises were carried out showed that great progress had been made in training and discipline since the school was started on the 15th April last. The men are comfortably housed, and their appearance gave the impression that the service was popular. . . . The various branches of training, such as musketry, gymnastics, training in mounted duties, &amp;c., are each under the direct supervision of a Swedish officer. [1340] RThe physique of the rank and file at present is not good, but it will doubtless improve, as the Swedes attach such great importance to the gymnastic training. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 227. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received July 29.) Sir, Tehran, July 9, 1912. I HAD the honour to inform you in my telegram of the 2nd instant that it was reported from Tabriz that Mujallal-es-Sultan, who has recently gained some notoriety as a lieutenant of Salar-ed-Dowleh, had arrived at Nehmetabad, and had practically taken sanctuary in this village near Tabriz, in which the summer quarters of the Russian consulate-general are situated. This report was confirmed by my Russian colleague, who added that he had instructed the acting consul-general to proceed at once to the arrest of Mujallal-es-Sultan, and that he had subsequently, upon the receipt of authority to do so from St. Petersburgh, caused the late rebel general to be deported to Russia. On hearing of Mujallafs arrival at Nehmetabad, the “ chef de cabinet ” of the Minister for Foreign Affairs called upon me, and said that the Persian Government proposed to demand the surrender of the refugee from the Russian Minister, on the ground that it was agreed at the time when Mohammed Ali Mirza’s pension was arranged that any of his followers returning to Persia and bearing arms against the Government should be treated as outlaws. I strongly dissuaded Moin-el-Yezareh from the adoption of such action ; firstly, because it would be impossible for the Russian Legation to surrender a fugitive to certain execution; and, secondly, because by making such a demand they would inevitably estrange many of their European well-wishers. I understand that no such demand has been made. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. * 25 No. 228. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) Sir, _ • Tehran, July 9, 1912. IN continuation of my despatch of the 22nd June, I have the honour to forward to you herewith a copy of a further despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman, in which the defeat of the rebels is recorded. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 228. Consul Eaig to Sir W. Townley. ^ r &gt; . . Kerman, May 28, 1912. IN continuation of my despatch dated the 22nd May, 1912, I have the honour to inform you that the rebels were driven from the neighbourhood of Kerman on the 25 th May. 2. On the 24th May Prince Amir-i-Azam went so far as to leave the town in order to meet the rebels near their camp and discuss terms of peace, the meeting having been airanged by two mullahs who had been sent out, but as he went out with his full escort the rebels were alarmed and refused to meet him. The next day he marched out of the town with about 600 men and a 9-centim. gun. The rebels had already begun a retrograde movement, which was interrupted by his attack, from Fathabad towards Baghin, and had carried off one of the two 7-centim. guns which they had and all their plunder. In the fight which ensued the other 7-centim. gun was captured and the rebels were put to flight, but they all escaped and no captures of any importance113 were made. His losses were four wounded, one of whom has since died, and those of the rebels, w ic it is impossible to ascertain, are variously estimated at two killed by the most virulent of his detractors and seventy killed and wounded by the most sanguine of Ins adheients. I am inclined to believe that between ten and twenty killed and wounded would be a fair estimate. The rebels have retired to Bardsir where Bahadur-ul-Mulk s property is situated, and have thus for the present made good their escape, whereas if Prince Amir-i-Azam had attacked them just before dawn in their camp at Fathabad, when their spirits were at the lowest ebb, I believe he could have captured all of them and recovered both gams. He informs me that he proposes to follow them into Bardsir within the next two or three days, and I shall do my utmost to keep him to his word, for although I do not believe that they will again threaten the city, they will certainly cause much misery in the province so long as they remain in arms and together. 3- I have explained in my previous despatches on this subject the motives which prompted those who marched on the city to rebel, and in paragraph 8 of my despatch of the 22nd May I have mentioned the existence in the city of a party which sympathised with the rebels, maintained constant communication with them, and urged them to advance and take possession of Kerman. These are the persons styling themselves democrats men without ability or political convictions. Prince Amir-i-Azam has done little to justify their animosity, but they are opposed to the presence of a strong governor in Kerman. It was they who assisted Sardar-i-Nusrat in the intrigues which ended in the dismissal of Prince Jalal-ed-Dowleh, who afterwards protested vigorously against the appointment of Sardar-i-Muhiyy, and who five months ago fomented the anti-foreign agitation, which was suppressed by Amir-i-Azam on bis arrival. The invalidation of the elections for the local assembly—which has been attributed by some to the Prince—annoyed the leader of this party—Agha Yahya— lately chairman of the assembly, and he and all his followers have for some time past been intriguing against Amir-i-Azam. What they desire is the appointment of some local nonentity as Acting Governor of Kerman, and the distribution of offices in the various departments among themselves. The dispatch of Sardar-i-Nusrat to Tehran caused his adherents to ally themselves to the democrats, and the movement has been much assisted by Adl-es-Sultan, Sardar-i-Nusrat’s brother, who has been receiving numerous telegrams from his brother in Tehran. Basharat-ul-Mamalik, the recently appointed superintendent of the Persian telegraph office, joined the movement soon after bis arrival, and was most unfortunately selected by the Persian Government as an envoy to the rebels. When he visited their camp he accepted large sums of money as the price of his support. I have already mentioned 1,000 tomans (200Z.) as the sum received by him, but have since seen a detailed account prepared by him in which he acknowledges the receipt of 975 tomans (195Z.), of which 100 tomans (20Z.) were contributed by Seyyid Bakir, an assistant in the revenue office, who joined the rebels. The superintendent of this office, Mirza Mahdi Khan, a Kermani, originally sympathised with the movement, but he is a nervous man, and, when its success appeared to be doubtful, asked me whether I would shelter him in the consulate in case of necessity. I replied that I would admit neither him nor any other opponent of the Governor- General, and he changed his attitude, but he is utterly unfitted for his post, and should be replaced by somebody who does not belong to Kerman. Amir-i-Azam did not know to whom to turn for assistance or whom to trust, and even those who favoured his cause were lukewarm in their support, fearing to render themselves obnoxious to his enemies, but wdiat chiefly disheartened him was the conduct of the Persian Government. When I visited the camp on the 19th May and assured the leaders that their Government would regard them as rebels if they did not disperse, they were most indignant, and openly accused the Minister of the Interior of duplicity. They produced telegrams which they had received from him and which were very far from being discouraging m tone. The Persian Government has accused Amir-i-Azam of ordering his farrashbashi in writing to squeeze as much money as he could out of the people of Jiruft. It would be interesting to learn how it got this information. The farrashbashi was captured and his papers stolen from him by the rebels in Jiruft, and I do not believe that between the time of his capture and the time when the Government brought the accusation against Amir-i-Azam there was time for the incriminating letter to have reached Tehran from Jiruft; and if this be so, the Government was relying, not only for the existence of the letter, but also for the nature of its contents, on telegraphic information received from the rebels, and m any case has convicted itself of holding direct communication with them. As a mattei of fact, the ex-governor of Jiruft, who was one of the leaders of the rebels, had paid only [1340] 11 2about one-eighth or one-tenth of the revenue due from him for the last year, and it is quite possible that a stringent, but justifiable, order for the collection of all arrears was distorted by the rebels into a general licence to plunder. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel. No. 229. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) Sir, Tehran, July 10, 1912. WITH reference to previous correspondence upon the subject of the present state of the Shiraz-Bushire road, and the failure of the Persian Government to carry out the conditions contained in Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 4th April last respecting the attack upon Mr. Smart and his escort in the month of December last, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of a note which I have received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, explaining the steps that the Persian Govern ment have taken with a view to complying with the demands of His Majesty’s Government. It will be seen that Ala-es-Sultaneh states that a telegram has been sent to the ulema and chiefs in Pars, advising them to adopt a friendly attitude towards British subjects and British commerce. I have ascertained chat this telegram has now been duly circulated, but I am advised by His Majesty’s consular officer at Shiraz that such messages from the Princes of the Church at Nejef and Kerbela no longer have the same effect as in the past to allay mischief, though they are as efficacious to-day as ever they were to afford a good pretext for making trouble. It is true that arrangements have been made for the departure of the new Governor-General, and I am assured almost daily, from one source or another, that he is leaving in a few days. M. Mornard has been freely accused of being the cause of the delay, through his unwillingness or inability to produce the necessary funds for the purpose. I have repeatedly urged upon M. Mornard the urgent importance of arranging the financial difficulties, and have invariably received the most satisfactory assurances that all is in order. Still, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s departure is delayed, and only yesterday I was advised by M. Mornard that he had sent a fresh telegram to Shiraz urging the financial agent there to expedite the necessary payments. This fact proves that, in spite of the repeated assurances to the contrary, there has been some opposition on the part of the treasurer-general for which I am unable to account. In the course of recent conversations, Ala-es-Sultaneh has expressed the utmost confidence in the ability of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to restore order and secure the arrest of the persons responsible for the attack on Mr. Smart. The same faith in the new governor is expressed by Sardar Assad, who professes to anticipate a complete resto ration of order in the south with Sardar Jang in charge of the Bakhtiari country and the governorship of Behbehan and the Kuhgelui tribes and Amir Mufakham at Kerman. Tou will notice, Sir, that in dealing with the clause concerning the punishment of the culprits, Ala-es-Sultaneh’s note states that his predecessor understood from Sir George Barclay that the acceptance by the Persian Government of the obligation to pay 4,744L as compensation had closed the incident, and that the question of the punishment of the offenders would not be insisted upon. There is nothing on record to show that Sir G. Barclay made such a statement, and when Yossuk-ed-Dowleh made the same remark to me some time ago, I said that I thought he must have misunderstood my predecessor’s meaning, since his intention could only have been to express in his own name and that of His Majesty’s Govern ment his satisfaction that the Persian Government had so readily recognised their obligation to pay such a very moderate compensation as that put forward. It is asserted that the interview in question took place at the Russian Legation whilst Sir G. Barclay and Vossuk-ed-Dowleh were waiting for the Russian Minister. I cannot ascertain that any one else was present on the occasion. Yossuk-ed-Dowleh’s knowledge of French is somewhat elementary, and he may easily, in good faith, have construed more into the necessarily complimentary phrases that my predecessor would have used than the words themselves implied. I have'recently discussed the situation on the Bushire-Shiraz road and the failure to arrest the culprits at considerable length with Ala-es-Sultaneh, and I have pointed115 out to his Highness the very serious state of affairs existing in the province of Fars. I have shown him that the situation is rapidly becoming an intolerable one, and I have warned him, speaking confidentially in my own name only, that it would appear to me inevitable that His Majesty s Government will be obliged to alter their present conciliatory attitude unless it is seen that the Persian Government are able to restore order on the road, the disturbed condition of which causes such incalculable damage to British trade. His Highness has assured me, in reply, that the Persian Government fully appreciate the friendly attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and that they entirely realise the seriousness of the situation. He has pointed out that special local conditions that have no connection with the unfortunate incident dealt with in the note are responsible for the deplorable state of affairs that prevails, and he has expressed his sincere regret that the Persian Government are unable at the present moment, when they are without any reliable military force at their disposal, and have had to repel the rebellious inroads of a pretender in the north, to take the necessary steps to restore order. The Minister has expressed great hope in the future, and would appear to anticipate good results from the gendarmerie force now being organised under Swedish officers. His Highness has added that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has been given special and definite instructions to assist to the utmost of his ability the Swedish mission. The question as to which is the best course to adopt in order to obtain that peace and security upon the Bushire-Shiraz road that is of such paramount importance to British trade with Persia is a most difficult one. With it is closely connected the question of the arrest of the men guilty of the attack upon Mr. Smart, because when once order has been restored the surrender of the culprits should follow of itself. At the time of writing I have received a private letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, assuring me that the reports of the state of affairs that I have received from the south are exaggerated, and that the Government’s advices are to the effect that there is good hope of a peaceful solution, and of a satisfactory settlement as soon as Mukhber-es-Sultaneh arrives. Ala-es-Sultaneh adds that the present Government have only recently assumed the reins of office, and declares that they are paying very serious attention to the question of the disordered condition of Fars. His Highness expresses an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government will give them time in which to prove themselves, and he repeats the oft-told tale that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh is about to start. I am strongly of opinion that a British occupation of South Persia should be avoided as long as may be possible, although I am fully alive to the fact that the present intolerable situation cannot be endured indefinitely. It would, in my opinion, be impossible to fix a term for such an occupation, which I fear might be accompanied by very far-reaching consequences. I am also somewhat sceptical as to how much founda tion there is for the statement occasionally made that British prestige has been entirely destroyed in the south. Mr. Smart’s correspondence would seem to show that he can stdl make his influence felt to no inconsiderable extent, although the situation is a difficult one when such men as Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli apparently flout all constituted authority, Persian and European alike. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in Ho. 229. Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir W. Townley. (Translation.) Your Excellency, July 2, 1912. IN reply to Sir G. Barclay’s note of the 4th April last 1 have the honour to state that, as the Imperial Government appreciate the fuendly representations made by His Majesty’s Government, and consider it necessary to make their best efforts to consolidate the existing friendship, they have taken into special consideration the suggestions made on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the note undei yeply. Since the receipt of the note in question the Persian Government have not failed to make every effort, and in most of the steps taken they have been successful, these are enumerated here for your Excellency’s consideration. As your Excellency has already been verbally informed, the attention of the clergy has been drawn to the fact that, according to the statement made m the note under reply, the policy of the British Government is based on non-intervention in thesouth, and telegrams have been sent to the ulema and chiefs in Fars advising them to adopt a friendly policy towards British subjects and British commerce. 2. Effective measures have been taken for the organisation of a gendarmerie under Swedish officers. A school has been opened at Shiraz, where over 300 men are under arms and being trained. This number will be increased until the plan made for the gendarmerie of the south is put into execution. It is hoped that it will be possible that most of the important roads should be guarded by the gendarmes by next autumn. 3. Arrangements for the departure of the new Governor-General of Fars have been made, and he will start in a few days. With regard to the punishment of the culprits implicated in Mr. Smart’s incident, I have the honour to point out that, after the Persian Government had agreed to pay the sum of 4,744h, his Excellency Sir G. Barclay thanked my predecessor and assured him that the question of punishment would not be insisted upon, and my predecessor, therefore, considered the question closed. I hope, as I have already told you verbally, that after the arrival of the new Governor-General of Fars local difficulties will be ended, and that the gendarmerie will be more effective. The Persian Government, therefore, hope that His Britannic Majesty’s Government will continue to show the good will and friendship they have always shown in the past, and, as promised, that they will recall the Indian troops in Shiraz, Ispahan, and Bushire. I avail, &amp;c. MOHAMMED ALI. No. 230. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) Sir, Tehran July 10 1912 WITH reference to my despatch of the 18 th ultimo, I have the honour ’to report that an arrangement has now been practically concluded by which Sardar Jang has been put in control of the Ispahan-Ahwaz road and the entire Bakhtiari country. A son of the Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the actual Prime Minister, has been associated with Sardar Jang. A firman signed by the four leading khans has been given to Sardar Jang, conferring upon him very full powers and fixing the duration of his mission at five years.’ He will also be Governor of Behbehan, and have control over the Kuhgeluis, who are chiefly responsible for the raids on the road. The 8,000Z. that are required by the khans foi the^ financing of Sardar Jang s mission have been advanced by the Imperial Bank of Persia as a loan, secured on the khans shares m the Bakhtiari Oil Company. Sardar Jang has by no means an easy task before him, as the younger khans, who have remained with the tribes, are very out of hand. At the request of the khans here lam sending them a strong message through His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan. I have also instructed Captain Grey to accompany Sardar Jang on the road as his presence may be useful to him, and he will thus be in close touch with the most impoi tant Bakhtiari leader as far as concerns British trade interests. I have great hopes that the mission of Sardar Jang, who is an energetic and able man, may prove a real success, and may result in the re-establishment of order and security on the road, but Persians are apt to disappoint, and the fair promises made in Tehran may be forgotten or blown away on the Bakhtiari mountains. In order to secure the services of Sardar Jang on the Bakhtiari road, I have agreed to the appointment of his elder brother, Amir Mufakham, as Governor of Jxeiman. I have reason to hope that he will prove a good and capable governor, wtm will restore order in that troubled province. He has shown himself a capable administrator. I have impressed upon him the importance of the post he is about to occupy from the point of view of British interests, and I have told him that I expect him to keep the road to Bunder Abbas open and free from robbers. He is a man of few words but of considerable resolution, and the assurances he has given me have been of the most satisfactory nature. . thes x e ^ brothers act up to their promises they may be able to render valuable assistance to Mukhber-es-Sultaneh at Shiraz, as the marauding tribes with which they will have to deal on each side of Fars extend their fields of operation into that province. * 1 I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.117 No. 231. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received July 29.) (Telegraphic.) SITUATION at Tabriz. Tehran, July 28, 1912. Acting British consul at Tabriz telegraphs as follows 26th July “ Shuja-ed-Dowleh yesterday sent for the merchants ostensibly in connection with the question of the export of carpets containing aniline dye. When they arrived they found the Russian consul-general, who informed them that the Russian Government intended to inflict severe punishment on the Shahsevans. They were then asked by Shuja in the^ presence of the Russian consul-general what their opinion was with regard to the appointment of Sipahdar. They of course answered that they would rather stay under Shuja’s rule. The question of aniline carpets was then lightly touched on. Merchants were again sent for this morning and requested to come to the telegraph office. On their arrival a telegram was dispatched to Tehran praising Shuja and requesting the Persian Government not to send Sipahdar to Tabriz. A letter couched in the same terms was also sent to the Russian consul-general here. Merchants were very reluctant to sign the letter, but were obliged to do so. I am under no doubt that all the above was previously arranged and that every effort is being made to prevent the ' arrival of Sipahdar. Further telegram dated 27th July :— “ Please see my telegram of yesterday. “ Seyyids closed the bazaars this morning. I have no doubt in my own mind that Shuja ordered them to take this step. Mullahs then made inflammatory speches to a crowd which gathered in the mosque near the British and Russian consulates. The speeches were directed against the constitutionalists and against those responsible for the appointment of Sipahdar. The population seems bent on using all means to prevent the latter coming to his post. The outcome of the present demonstration might easily be a demand for the recall to Persia of Mohammed Ali Shah. More serious trouble may ensue here unless Russian consul-general gives instructions to Shuja to stop at once all these intrigues. “ Shuja is such a violent opponent of Sipahdar that if the latter does come here it would be desirable that the former be compelled to quit the province. “ The Russian consul-general informs me, in reply to a friendly note in which I expressed my surprise at Shuja’s behaviour, that he has urged him to cause the bazaars to be reopened. He suggested that 1 should take similar action. I therefore addressed a note to Shuja in this sense.” Mr. Acting Consul Stevens had informed me in a previous telegram that the Belgian Customs officer appointed by the treasurer-general to represent him had been ejected by Shuja from the Tabriz provincial Treasury. The officer in question had thereupon resigned both from the Customs as well as from the Treasury. No. 232. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 28, 1912. MY telegram of to-day. The “ chef de cabinet ” of the Minister of Foreign Affairs came to see me this morning to say that the Persian Government were receiving a flood of telegrams from Tabriz deprecating the appointment of Sipahdar and urging the retention of Shuja as governor. There was little doubt, he said, that Shuja had organised the dispatch of these telegrams. The Government were afraid that endeavours would be made to close the bazaars and to bring about other demonstrations of a, violent nature. It was feared that on hearing of these manifestations against him the Sipahdar might resign his appointment and retire to his estates in Mazanderan; he is now in camp at Kazvin. Should the Sipahdar do this, Shuja, acting as he does independently of the Central Government, would be left in possession of the Governor ship of Azerbaijan, that province being therefore virtually separated from the Empire.The Persian Government would not accept the responsibility for such a situation, and the Cabinet would prefer to resign office. Unless Sipahdar replaced Shuja, the Persian Government would be stultified in the eyes of the people, as they had accepted the extension of the Cossack brigade on the express understanding that Sipahdar should take up the Azerbaijan appointment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs would be most grateful if you would urge the Russian Government to send immediate instructions to their representative at Tabriz to use all his endeavours to prevent Shuja encouraging the opposition to Sipahdar’s arrival at his post.

The “chef de cabinet” of the Minister for Foreign Affairs came to see me this morning. He said that the Russian Government were making the concession to Russia of the Julfa-Tabriz-Urmia Railway a condition of the further advance of money which the Persian Government were now endeavouring to obtain. He said that the Persian Government begged that we would use our influence at St. Petersburg!! with a view to the question being dealt with separately, and he explained how strongly opposed the Persian Government were to the Russian point of view. Moreover, should the Persian Government persist in their attitude, the Persian Government expressed their earnest hope that the British share of the advance might be made without waiting for the Russian share. The need of money for the payment of the troops at Kermanshah was most urgent, and the favourable moment for completing the work of pacification in that province was slipping away. I had not received your telegram of 27th July to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh at the time that the above communication was made. No. 234. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 28, 1912. HIS Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed telegraphs as follows under date the 27th July:— “ I hear from reliable sources that the Russian Government will shortly withdraw from here General Redko and Taman and Caucasian Cossacks, Kuban battery, and the 13th Turkestan Rifles. “ The Kuchan garrison will be strengthened by one company of the 18th Turkestan Rifles; the garrison there will then be 250 strong.

Neratof to-day whether he could not instruct Russian consul-general to use his influence with bbuja-ed-Dowleh to induce him to stop stirring up popular excitement against Sipahdar, especially in view of the fact that the Persian Government had consented to the extension of the Cossack brigade conditionally on the appointment of the latter to Tabriz. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the consul-general had done, and would continue to do, all he could. Shuja-ed-Dowleh had said that he was prepared to leave Tabriz when Sipahdar had arrived within a given distance in deference to the consul-general’s representations, but the latter was of opinion that it would be more prudent for him to remain in order to hand over the administration personally to his successor, pointing out that it would be unsafe to leave the town at the mercy of the populace.

ADVANCE to Persian Government. Your telegram of the 30th July. . . I saw M. Neratof to-day. His Excellency informed me that the Russian Minister at Tehran had telegraphed suggesting an arrangement which, in M. Poklewsky s opinion, would be acceptable to the Persian Government. Ihe Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs did not divulge the nature of this arrangement. He said that in any case he must consult the Minister of Finance before sending a reply. I told his Excellency that you hoped that the Imperial Government w ould not press the Julfa-Tabriz Railway concession for the present, as the Persian Government were so urgently m need of money. I enquired whether an assuiance from the Persian Government that they would immediately enter into negotiations respecting the railway would satisfy the Russian Government. I added that I had discussed the question with the Persian Minister that morning, who seemed to be of the opinion t at is Government would be prepared to give such an assurance^ more especia yi t e Russian Government let them understand that some participation m the project would be allowed them. [1340] SThe Minister of Finance was determined, M. Neratof informed me, that this question should he settled once and for all. He thought that an arrangement of the nature I proposed might he arrived at, as the Russian Government were quite prepared to offer favourable conditions. But the Minister of Finance must be consulted before he could come to any decision. No. 239. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 31.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 31, 1912.

ACTING CONSUL at Shiraz telegraphs that gendarmerie has met with a reverse at the hands of a marauding band under Soulet-ed-Dovvleh, about 500 strong, which had taken up a position commanding Shiraz-Bushire road, which was thereby practically blockaded. Acting consul reports that gendarmerie force was composed of 80 cavalry and 180 infantry, with 1 mountain gun, under two Swedish officers; that greater part of them fled without firing a shot, and were subsequently surrounded by enemy, to whom they surrendered without resistance, losing all their arms. Breech of the gun blew up and was abandoned. Small part of force, with two officers, fought for some time ineffectually, but succeeded in retreating to Shiraz. Major Siefvert, who was in command of expedition, was slightly wounded in stomach. It would appear that original intention was for gendarmerie to move out one stage from Shiraz to Chenar Rahdar, and from there advance against Soulet with a force under Kawam, but that Major Siefvert, without communicating with Kawam, advanced alone in spite of urgent representations not to do so. Actual engagement took place near Diringun. No. 249. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, August 6, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer to Sir W.

Having failed to secure the loan of police officers from the Dutch Government, the Persian Government have requested the Swedish Government to provide the men. This step was taken without consulting the two legations. I pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that the Government should not have acted in this way. After offering some excuse, his Highness said that the colonel of the gendarmerie had been consulted before the step was taken. Colonel Hjalmarson had expressed the opinion that both services should be in Swedish hands and that it would be to the advantage of both.

A GROUP has been formed for the purchase of the Persian Crown jewels, and \ve have been approached in the matter. If the Persian Government are desirous of selling it is not for the two Powers to prevent them, but to take the matter m hand and facilitate the transaction on certain conditions. Otherwise the Crown jewels will be sold surreptitiously, and no one will be the gainer. At present matters are moving in a vicious circle. No one mil len money to Persia until her house is in order, and no improvement is possible m the state of the country unless money is forthcoming. The two Powers might arrange for the sale of124 the jewels, repay themselves for the recent small advances, and lay down conditions for the expenditure of the rest of the money.

If the Persian Government object to intervention of the two Powers we could point out that if we take the matter in hand they will probably get better price for the jewels than if they in their present bankrupt condition were to try and find a purchaser.

But it will presumably be necessary to consider the position of the Central Government and especially of the treasurer-general. Lord Crewe would suggest that Sir W. Townley should be consulted on the question of policy ; but in the meantime he notes the instructions conveyed in Sir E.

I should be glad to receive instructions as to the particular account I am to debit with regard to payment to Persian Government sanctioned in your telegram of the 7th August. In my opinion, the best plan would be to hand over the money to the treasurer- general, making arrangements with him to transmit amounts to Shiraz as required by Smart, who estimated that 5,000b would be a sufficient sum. Under Smart’s super vision the proper distribution of the money should be assured, and any surplus that might then remain could be devoted to the continuation of the Kawam’s work by the new Governor-General on his arrival.

The Russian Minister and I have, in a joint note, asked the Persian Government to submit their army scheme to us without delay. We have pointed out in the note that their action in this matter is not consistent with their engagements to seek the advice of the two legations before engaging foreign officials. I gather that the Netherlands Minister, when submitting the Persian request to his Government, counselled its rejection on the ground that there is much uncertainty with regard to Persian finances, and because it was improbable that any credit would be reflected on the foreign officers by the material which would, in his opinion, be available for recruiting purposes.

He is very hopeful with regard to the ultimate success of the gendarmerie, but complains that the present very healthy development is being checked by lack of money.

Considerable resentment is felt here at an official statement made in the House of Commons to the effect that it would be difficult for Persia to make a foreign loan without a British and Russian guarantee in the present state of her finances and condition of the country. Persian Government consider that His Majesty’s Government have a false impression of the state of the country, and I am held responsible for this impression. Treasurer-general, when discussing the financial situation with me to-day, said that in his opinion the resources of the country would be sufficient to meet a loan of 6,000,000Z., but that unless the proceeds of such a loan were devoted to developing the productive resources of the country, and the settlement of outstanding claims post poned until the effects of the financial assistance given had had time to make themselves felt, there would be little money left for daily expenses. A much more thorough European control of the finances than exists at present would, in my opinion, have to be established if such a result is to be attained. r _ , No. 276. Sir W.

RUSSIAN demands respecting the concession for the Julfa-Tabriz-Urmia Railway have now been accepted by the Persian Government in such terms that an immediate commencement of the Russian negotiations can now be made, and negotia tions carried through to a successful conclusion without any reference to a Medjliss. Russian Minister is of opinion that his Government will be satisfied with the Persian reply, though it is true there is some vagueness in their assurances as to the part relating the Medjliss. It will probably be possible, however, for the Russian Government to carry this point under pressure when the time comes. With regard to the Mohammerah line, I have obtained, in addition to the Shah’s rescript, verbal assurances from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that the line shall enjoy equal advantages with the Russian line as regards negotiations. Under these circumstances it is highly desirable that negotiations should be pushed on with as little delay as possible. No. 277. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 24.)

He has presumably taken this129 step in order to give the Russian authorities time to move out of the palace. Shuja’s attitude at present gives no grounds for uneasiness. He has issued a proclamation informing the people that the Persian Government have sent Sipahdar as governor, and exhorting them to submit to him, as his aims are those common to all Mussulmans. But it depends largely on how Sipahdar treats Shuja whether the latter’s future attitude remains benevolent or not.” My Russian colleague informs me that telegrams have reached Sipahdar from the population of Tabriz expressing contrition for their former obstructive messages and congratulating him on his appointment.

On receipt of the news that Sipahdar, whose appointment as Governor-General of Azerbaijan had been officially announced some four months ago, had actually left Tehran to take up his duties, Shuja-ed-Dowleh commenced an agitation against him. At his instigation a telegram protesting against Sipahdar’s appointment was sent by the local merchants to Tehran ; the bazaars were closed, inflammatory speeches against the constitution were made in the mosques, and arms and ammunition were served out to the populace, to enable them to oppose Sipahdar’s arrival by force. Representations, however, having been made by the British and Russian authorities, Shuja desisted in his attempts to incite the people against the Central Government, and agreed to hand over the administration to Sipahdar as soon as the latter arrived. Sipahdar, who left Tehran on the 18th July, remained at Kazvin while the demonstrations against him continued ; but, on hearing that the state of affairs in Tabriz was becoming normal, he left for Zinjan on the 1st August. During July the Russian forces in the field against the Shahsevans were reinforced by some 2,000 men from the Tabriz garrison. These were replaced by fresh troops from Russia. Meshed. The state of the province and the town has remained the same as reported in last month’s summary. Ispahan. During the past month the condition of the town and environs have been as unsatisfactory as usual, but the lawlessness in the province has increased, especially in the neighbourhood of Ivum, where several caravans have been robbed of late. On the 10th July a party of Kuhgeluis looted and burnt the caravanserai at Malamir, on the Lynch road, and other parties of the same tribe are reported to have plundered some villages in Bakhtiari territory. On the 19th July about 100 men and women belonging to a local tribe took refuge in the office of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Kum, in order to compel the governor to take action against one Mirza Reza Khan, who had driven them away from their pasture lands. The tribespeople are still in “bast,” as the governor does not appear to have any power over Reza Khan. The matter has been taken up by the Central Government. Yezd. Although no further depredations have been reported in the immediate vicinity of Yezd, the district is still infested by bands of marauders. On the 2nd August Bahramabad, on the Yezd-Kerman road, was attacked by a large force of Baharlus, and on the night of the 2nd/3rd August the caravanserai at Ardekan, 40 miles north-west of Yezd, was rushed by a party of tribesmen, and 250 loads and 700 camels carried off. Acting under instructions from the Minister of the Interior, Entezam-ul-Mulk, who has been at large since his raid on Ardistan last June, has returned to that town in order to make his peace with the Government,131 Shiraz. Owing to the inability of the deputy governor of the Arabs to maintain any semblance of order among the tribes in Eastern Ears, and to the activity among Soulet’s followers, Kawam commenced collecting a force in Shiraz with a view to going out himself and restoring order in the province. At the beginning of August Kawam’s forces wmre not ready to take the field, but as Soulet’s followers had approached quite close to Shiraz, Major Siefvert with a party of 80 mounted and 180 dismounted gendarmes moved out to Chenar Rahdar, about 10 miles to the east of Shiraz. It was Kawam’s intention to join him there as soon as he had collected a sufficient force. On the 5th August, however, without waiting for Kawam’s men, Major Siefvert marched against Soulet’s following, and was severely defeated, losing the greater part of his force. Major Siefvert, who was wounded, and Captain Nystrom together with a few gendarmes managed to fight their way back to Shiraz. Kerman. Amir-i-Azam, having been removed from the post of governor by the orders of the Central Government, left Kerman at the end of July. On his departure, Adl-es-Sultan, the commander of the troops, brought some tribesmen into the town, ostensibly for the purpose of assisting his troops to keep order. These tribesmen, however, commenced robbing the townspeople, especially those who had been loyal to the governor during the recent troubles. This resulted in some thirty people taking “ bast ” in His Majesty’s consulate. Kermanshah Salar-ed-Dowleh, according to the latest information received by the Persian Government, is still in the vicinity of Kermanshah. . Prince Farman Farma, having no money to pay his troops, has informed the Central Government that unless money is sent to him he will be compelled to take over the customs receipts to pay his men, otherwise they will disperse and the town will again be at the mercy of Salar-ed-Dowleh. No. 281. Sir IF. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received August 26.) gj r Tehran, August 6, 1912. ’ MY telegram of the 12th July reported the final conclusion of the arrange- ment fully described in my despatch of the 10th July, by which Sardar Jang lias been appointed supreme ilkhani ot the Bakhtiari and Governor ° ei reran an the Kuhgeluieh for a period of live years. I now have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of Sardar Assads letter to me, t enc osing re ex o e agreement, dated the 10th July, by which Sardar Jang is appointed supreme il with absolute power. This document, of which a translation is enmose ( nc osui - • ), will show you; Sir, that the khans seem at last to be determined to make a serious attempt to restore order in their country and to maintain seemi y on P , Ahwaz road. Article 5 stipulates that all the revenues usually coll ® ct ^ b F khans, including all sums payable by the Anglo-Persran Oil ^^Prime Minister’s encashed by the^new ilkhani and his partner, Morteza Kuli Khan ^ f “ ™ard s for son), and are to be expended “for interna Bakhtiari .^tveme^it of the the road and the oil-wills, the repair of the bridges, and the impiovement of the ^Enclosures Nos.

At Sardai Jangs request^ [1340]since arranged with Colonel Douglas, who is in command of the Indian detachment at Shiraz and Ispahan, that fourteen men and a non-commissioned officer of the Ispahan detachment should be added to Captain Grey’s escort of six sowars, thus bringing his escort to a total of twenty-one men. This addition to Captain Grey’s escort will only be temporary during that officer’s stay in Chehar Mahal, and will return to Ispahan when he leaves Sardar Jang. By this means it will be made quite clear to the minor khans, who are inclined to give trouble, that Sardar Jang enjoys the moral support of His Majesty’s Legation, and I hope that the new ilkhani will thus be enabled so to strengthen his position as to render himself paramount. Turning to the question of Bakhtiari relations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, which are referred to in Sardar Assad’s letter to me and my reply, and have formed the subject of considerable telegraphic correspondence between myself and His Majesty’s resident at Bushire of late, I need perhaps not weary you for the present with a detailed report of the conflict and its present phase. There are many questions at issue between the two sides, and I propose, as already reported, with your concurrence, to delegate His Majesty’s consular officers at Mohammerah and Ahwaz to act as arbitrators in the matter. The appointment of Sardar Jang, however, leads me to entertain some hope that there need not be any fear of any fresh complications arising between the sheikh and the Bakhtiaris, and that the settlement of such differences as have already arisen will be facilitated. If the present arrangement results, as I have every reason to hope, in the restoration of security and order on the Ispahan—Ahwaz road, the time and trouble expended upon it will not have been in vain. At the moment of closing this despatch I have received a telegram from Sardar Jang announcing his safe arrival and stating that he proposes to continue his journey to the Bakhtiari country at an early date, in full confidence of the success of his mission, despite the fact that certain sowars promised him by the Central Government have not been dispatched. ^As I have already informed Sardar Jang by telegraph, the present pecuniary difficulties of the Government have prevented their carrying out their promise. The arrears of pay due to all such men as those required by Sardar Jang are so considerable that the dispatch of even fifty men would mean a heavy call on the resources of the treasury, as the men refuse to start until all the salary due to them for past services has been paid up in full. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 281. „. Sardar Assad to Sir W. Townley, (Translation.) Your Excellency , 10, 1912. 1 HAVE had the honour to receive your Excellency’s two notes dated the 26th May and the 27th June, respecting security in the Bakhtiari country and the differences between the Bakhtiari khans and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. As your Excellency is aware, I have always done my utmost in the interests of secunty on the Bakhtiari road, and now that this security has been somewhat shaken, I have taken definite measures in the matter. Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan have been given absolute authority and the necessary powers, and have been entrusted with the mission of maintaining order in the Bakhtiari country and on the Ahwaz road. They will start within a day or two, and after their arrival in the Bakhtiari country all cause for anxiety will be removed. I enclose a copy of the agreement made with Sardar Jang for the purpose of realising these intentions. r With regard to the unpleasantness between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the khans I would like to have the differences removed and friendship established between them, but for that purpose certain measures on the part of the sheikh are necessary, and that must be done through your kindness. The conditions proposed by the khans are as follows:— ^ 1 2 1. That the sheikh should pay compensation for all the damag’d which he has done to the properties of the khans and the Bakhtiari tribe. 2. That blood-money should be paid for those who have been killed.[1340] H 133 3. That the sheikh should not interfere with Shuster and Dizful. He should release all the Shusteris and the dependents of the khans who have been imprisoned by him, and pay compensation for the losses suffered by them. Should the sheikh carry out the above conditions, I can assure you that the unpleasantness would be removed, and I would be able to establish friendship between him and the khans, so that there may he no difficulties between them in the future.

WE, the undersigned, have with complete confidence on this 24th day of the month Rejeb, 1330 a.h. (10th July, 1912 a.d.), by order of the Imperial Government and of our own family, appointed Sardar Jang to be Governor-in-Chief of JBakhtiari, Chaharmahal, Kuhgeluieh, and Behbehan, from the present year Sichkan-il (21st March, 1912-20th March, 1913), until the end of the year Loin-il (21st March, 1916-20th March, 1917), .which constitutes five complete years. He will independently and powerfully, with absolute authority be independent “ ilkhani ” of the Bakhtiari tribe, and will carry out the conditions of the following articles :— Article 1. He will be, as stated above, for five complete years independently and powerfully the “ ilkhani,” and will not be liable to dismissal. During these five years one of the sons or descendants of the late ilkhani will always be in partnership with him in the capacity of “ilbeggi,” and will join him in profit or loss. For the present that person will be Morteza Kuli Khan. As long as Sardar Jang is satisfied with him he will remain with Sardar Jang and keep order. Whenever Sardar Jang is dissatisfied with him, and no longer desires that Mmrteza Kuh Khan should remain with him, he has the rioht to change Morteza Kuh Khan, and to appoint another of the sons (or descendants) of the late ilkhani in his place to act as his (Sardar Jang s) partner, and no one will have the right to make any objections. Art. 2. Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan have full powers with regard to the minor khans who are the sons or descendants of Jaafar Kuli Khan, and will, if they desire, retain them in Bakhtiari and Chaharmahal, but are at liberty to expel them if they deem it necessary to do so. The Government and we ourselves will accord the utmost support. If any of the sons (or descendants) of the late Jaafar Kuh Khan should disobey or rebel, they (the ilkhani and ilbeggi) will have the right to punish them severely with personal and tribal force. Should the affair become serious, and should the disobedient person or his dependants sustain loss, either of property or of life, no member of that family will have the right to complain^ , , , , Art. 3 For the maintenance of order m the Bakhtiari tribe and Chaharmaha Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan are empowered and authorised to issue any orders they like or to inflict any punishment or penalty on the minor khans, headmen and Bakhtiari.

With regard to the 8,000L borrowed from the Imperial Bank on account of the shares, and given by us to Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan, they will have to pay the bank every year 2,000h and interest, beginning from the end of the year Oud-il (21st March, 1913-20th March, 1914) and terminating at the end of the year Loin-il (21st March, 1916-20th March, 1917), which constitutes four complete years, during which time the administration of Bakhtiari is in the hands of Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan. In this way the whole of the 8,000L, with interest, will have been paid up in the four years. Should it so happen that one of these two men should die, which God forbid, their families must undertake to refund the balance of the pounds sterling due. Should it so happen (God forbid) during these four years, in each of which they must pay 2,000L, with interest, that Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan cease to interfere [? in tribal affairs] or are dismissed, they will have to pay from the year Oud-il (1913-14), when 2,000/., plus interest, will be payable, up to such year as they actually collected the Bakhtiari maliat and other revenue. After they have ceased to collect, they will have no responsibility, and such persons collecting the maliat and other revenues of Bakhtiari and Chaharmahal, the bridge, the flock revenues, the petroleum, &amp;c., will have to undertake the liability. Art. 7. Regarding the maliat for the present year Sichkan-il (1912-13) of Bakhtiari, the bridge, the flocks of Chaharmahal, and Faraidan, which has been collected by the khans of the family, every member will be responsible for the sum he has collected, and must hand it all over to Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan. Should they make difficulties in handing over the money, Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan will have the right to take it from their estates. - Art. 8. It has been agreed that as many sowars as are necessary for Tehran, from 100 to 2,000, wdll be prepared and sent to Tehran by Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan, or whoever is Sardar Jang’s partner, on condition that the sum of 15 tomans for each sowar is paid before their departure—for as many sowars as are required—to Sardar Jang and Morteza Kuli Khan, who will deliver them at Tehran. Any khan of the family who is appointed governor will have to pay 15 tomans per sowar for as many sowars as he wants Sardar Kuli Khan to send, and they will be dispatched. Whatever has been written in this document will not be contravened. NEJEF KULI BAKHTIARI, Samsam-es-Sultaneh. ALI KULI BAKHTIARI, Sardar Assad. GHOLAM HUSSEIN BAKHTIARI, Sardar Motashem.

WHEN you were in Tehran on a visit lately the Bakhtiari khans were being pressed to take immediate measures to restore order in their country and especially to restore security for British trade on the Bakhtiari road. The khans informed us, as you will remember, that they were prepared to entrust their mission to Nassir Khan bardar Jang, but that for this puropose he would require to borrow the sum of 40,000 tomans for which they offered the road tolls as security. Shortly after your departure I was sounded by the khans as to the proposed appointment of Lutf Ali Khan Amir Mufakham to the governorship of Kerman and Baluchistan. I intimated tha't if the khans were unable to maintain order in their own country it was clearly out of the question for me to entertain their proposal. They subsequently offered to mortgage their shares in the Bakhtiari Oil Company and the First Exploitation Company as security for an advance for the purpose of facilitating Sardar Jang’s mission. This has now been arranged, and you will see from the enclosed copies of the two bonds the khans have signed under what conditions they have borrowed 45,000 tomans from the Imperial bank. I also enclose Persian text and translation of the document signed by the khansappointing Bardar Jang “ilkhani” and Morteza Kuli Khan “ ilbeggi’’for five years with full powers. I have written to Sardar Jang that I take note of his appointment with satisfaction and wish him every success. A copy of my letter is also enclosed for your information. It has been arranged that you are to accompany Sardar Jang from Ispahan when he leaves for the Bakhtiari country in order to assist him at the outset of his mission to deal with the minor khans who are at present, I understand, somewhat out of hand. You are authorised to impress upon them the utmost importance of assisting Sardar Jang in every possible way, and to threaten them if necessary with the displeasure of His Majesty’s Government if they do anything to hamper the new ilkhani and ilbeggi in the execution of their duties. I trust that you will be able to achieve the object in view without much difficulty and that Bardar Jang’s mission will prove an eminent success. You will see that the Bakhtiari Khans’ share certificates are to be delivered to the Imperial Bank, and I request you to carry this out in due course. I am, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. ’ WITH reference to my telegram of yesterday’s date, I have the honour to transmit three telegrams that I have received from the acting British consul at Shiraz reporting upon the circumstances which led up to the defeat of the new gendarmerie force under Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom on the 5th instant at the hands of an irregular force of 500 men under Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who has succeeded m collecting a small body of men round him, and is occupying a position at Siakh, from whence he can command the caravan traffic on the Shiraz—Bushire road. I spoke at length yesterday to the Minister for horeign Affairs about the situation at Shiraz, and I urged upon his Highness the pressing need of immediately sen ing 25,000 tomans to the Kawam-ul-Mulk to meet the unavoidable expenses necessitatec y an expedition against Soulet, whose forces are likely to be largely increased as a result of his victory over the gendarmerie under European officers. , , Ala-es-Sultaneh promised that he would do his utmost to find some money, but he shrugged his shoulders hopelessly and said that all possible financia resouices a been exhausted in finding money for Kermanshah and other places where it is urgently needed, and that the Treasury chest is quite empty. No. 282. Sir, Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received August 26.) Tehran, August 7, 1912. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 282. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. Shiraz, August 4, 1912. but necessarily, been postponed.Local autLorities have hardly any money or cartridges. Sarbaz are clamouring for pay. They have long been in bast at Persian telegraph office, and threatening to come to consulate. Kawam has been restraining them, bnt 31st July they evaded his surveillance by slipping singly out of town and collected behind consulate with intention of forcing a bast. I only succeeded in dispersing them by threatening their officers that my guard would fire if sarbaz came on, and by promising to use my influence privately to obtain them relief. I fear scanty maliat still obtainable must be given to sarbaz to keep them quiet. It is urgent that serious expedition be dispatched to drive back marauders and occupy Firuzabad. Some financial help is necessary for this, otherwise Kawam will probably only be able to reoccupy Siakh and drive marauders into Khojeh, whence they will return when Government army disperses for want of funds necessary to follow up enemy. Repetitions of these alarms and excursions is most disastrous financially and for general order of the province. Arabs, who had been expecting Kawam, Avill now probably, relieved from fear, redouble their depredations. Could Persian Government give local authorities, say, 25,000 tomans to send force to drive back marauders and occupy Firuzabad ? Money could be largely recovered from maliat of Firuzabad and of Arabs, against whom deferred measures would then be possible; 25,000 spent now would be worth double that sum spent after things have got worse. I hope you will be able to persuade Persian Government to succour local authorities with that sum, without which they can do nothing effective. Enclosure 2 in No. 282. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Toumley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, August 5, 1912. MY telegram of yesterday. n Kawam has just sent me urgent message to effect that Major Siefvert with his 200 gendarmes, without previously consulting Kawam, left at dawn to-day for Siakh. Kawam’s five sowars, whom he had given to Siefvert to help latter locally at Chenar Ralidar, begged major to communicate first with Kawam, but he refused. Kawam fears Siefvert, unfamilar with tribal guerilla warfare, may lead his men to defeat, which would have bad effect on future prospects of gendarmerie and on present campaign against Soulet’s freebooters. Arab riflemen entered town to-day, and Kashgai rein forcements are expected to-morrow. Arabs are too tired to start out to-day. Kawam suggests 1 should use my influence to moderate Siefvert until Government army can join him. Asa civilian, I am reluctant to interfere with military dispositions of the major, who might resent my interference. Moreover, if he has really gone to Siakh, he must b} r now be within the war zone. I propose, therefore, unless I hear from you by noon, to tell the Kawam that I do not think it advisable to interfere. Enclosure 3 in No. 282. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, August 6, 1912. MY telegram of yesterday. Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom, with 80 mounted, 180 foot gendarmes and 1 gun marched towards Diringun, near which they encountered Soulet’s force. Great part of infantry gendarmerie fled without firing a shot and were surrounded by enemy, to whom they surrendered without resistance. Rest of force, with Swedish officers, fought for some time, but ineffectually. Gun, breach of which blew up while being fired, was abandoned. Gendarmerie generally scattered and fled, Swedish officers being then compelled to retreat with few men. Soulet’s men tried hard to catch them, but they succeeded in getting back to Chenar Rahdar, though Siefvert’s horse was shot in three places, and himself wounded in stomach, but not seriously. There were a number of casualties, and enemy appear to have captured nearly all the rifles, only fourteen having as yet been accounted for. Swedish officers returned last night, and fugitive gendarmes are dribbling in. They apparently took no water with them on the maich thiougn wateiless region, and it is to be feared that many of the wounded out139 there will die unless enemy succour them. Soulet’s men were in hillocks fortified with sangars, and apparently got round gendarmes, unused to hill fighting and ignorant of country, very easily. Probably enemy will let prisoners go. This disaster will have worst possible effect on present campaign, as utter rout of Government force will encourage enemy and make many new rebels. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 26.) Sir, Tehran, August 7, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram of the 20th ultimo, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah, reporting the departure from the town of the Government forces. Bisitun and are now at Sahneh, a stage beyond that place. There remain here the Hamadan fedai regiment and some 500 of the Farman Farina’s own sowars, as well as local troops ; more of latter are expected. The military leaders were dissatisfied at being kept here idle and scattered about the town, and also because Farman Farma had told some of those applying to him for pardon that they should not come in at present, the inference being that the military could not be trusted, which they deny. On 14th I met Farman Farma at the Russian consulate. He told us that the troops had left without his permission, and that the presence of 300 of the mujaheds was necessary with a Maxim and two guns, as many of the local troops had been on the side of the rebels, and the presence of a small body of trustworthy troops would prevent them yielding to any intrigues by Salar -ed-Dowleh. We both agreed that this was necessary, and telegraphed to that effect, sending telegrams to Hamadan by that nights post. _ _ . . From information which I have since obtained, I am inclined to^ discredit his Highness’s assertion that the troops left without his permission and to believe that objective is secret. At the same time, I am of opinion that the presence of a small body of trustworthy troops is necessary. Most of Salar-ed-Dowleh s adherents aie appi caching Farman Farma through different channels to obtain pardon, and the return of those who belong to the town might cause further intrigues, if the governor had no thorough y reliable troops in town. Further, Kurdistan is in a state of anarchy. . Salar-ed-Dowleh is in Alishtar of Luristan with Nazar Ali Khan Amrai, bardar Akram. They have about 700 men, but Nazar Ali is in constant communication with Farman Farma, and it is said that he would betray Salar in exchange for t e governorship of Luristan ; but I cannot vouch for this. I also hear that balar-ed- Dowleh has made overtures to Farman Farma to submit to the Government, i gian e a governorship anywhere in Persia. My authority for this is the man w o roug le correspondence that has passed between this legation and the snnaz coasmare, No. 283. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY, Sir, Enclosure in No. 283.

Tehran, August 14, 1912.I have also had a conversation with Colonel Hjalmarson, who told me that he had decided, in consequence of what has happened, to somewhat alter his plans respecting the policing of the Bashire-Shiraz road. He represented that he personally had always been opposed to the establishment of a separate gendarmerie detachment at Shiraz, but that he had been obliged to adopt this course against his will by the Persian Govern ment. He now proposes to return to his original idea, and to prepare a special force at Tehran for the Shiraz-Bushire road, leaving the 300 men now at Shiraz to finish their course of instruction there. Colonel Hjalmarson hopes to have 700 efficiently trained and equipped men ready in the spring for service on the road in question. He further pointed out that the unfortunate incident near Shiraz will not really delay operations, as he had already made up his mind that it would not be possible for the gendarmerie to assume control of the road in October, as had been anticipated. Colonel Hjalmarson, though much distressed by the reverse suffered at Shiraz, appeared in good heart about the future efficacity of the gendarmerie, and seemed quite satisfied with the general progress made. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 284. Sir W. Townley to Acting Consul Smart. (Telegraphic.) • Tehran, August 7, 1912. I HAVE urged upon the Central Government the great importance of sending Shiraz 25,000 tomans at once. The Minister for Foreign Affairs promises to try and find the money, and the Government fully realise the seriousness of the situation, but pending the conclusion of the conditions of a fresh Anglo-Russian advance there is no money in the Treasury, and the financial situation is extremely critical. The unwill ingness of the Persian Government to accede to the Russian demand for a railway concession from Julfa to Tabriz with an extension to the north of Lake Urmia is delaying the fresh Anglo-Russian advance. It was impossible for me to take any action on your telegram of the 5th August, which reached me too late. You acted quite rightly in not trying to dissuade Major Siefvert from making his forward movement. Enclosure 2 in No. 284. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, August 8, 1912. GENERAL situation. Postponement of Kawam’s departure to Khamseh tribes is having effect anticipated in penultimate paragraph of my telegram of the 4th August. Mirza Fazlullah Khan, deputy governor, Khamseh, telegraphs it is useless his remaining among tribes unless Kawam comes out by 1st of Ramazan; that already Arabs, Baseris, and Baharloos, in bands of hundred strong, are on war-path towards Ispahan, Yezd, and*Kerman ; that loyal Kalanters cannot restrain their men any longer, &amp;c. Kawam has now about .1,000 Arab and 400 Kashgai riflemen in town, whom he has not money to pay. He as yet holds them in control, though they are of course robbing in and around town in recognised manner of Persian irregulars on war-path. Kawam in consultation with me is taking precautions for protection of British houses distant from consulate, but he anticipates no danger at present. Kawam has summoned Baser! and more Arab riflemen, and he expects to have 4,000 to 5,000 tribal levies in town within few days. Allowance must be made for oriental exaggeration in computation, but the presence of large numbers of tribal bandits is unpleasant for the town. Tele phone message from Asker Khan to-day seems to hint than Kawam may have some difficulty in getting further Arab levies, and this difficulty is likely to be increased by gendarmes’ defeat. Force of Kashkulis and Farsimadanis is being collected in the neighbourhood of Khane Kinyan. At present these are confining their attention to methodical smashing of our telegraph insulators for extraction of steel stalks. Bushire road if still closed. Northern wires are of course going down with daily regularity.Soulet’s men have hitherto been inactive, beyond raiding Karabagh, 5 miles south of town. Kawam makes no offensive movement until his whole force is collected, as he hopes, if he can get any money, to make a thorough job of business this time. Unpaid sarbaz sent me round robin yesterday, complaining of my failure to succour them and renewing threats of bast. It has been usual for consulates to accept sarbaz basts in past, but with Indian soldiers ignorant of language encamped in and around consulate I cannot risk presence of sarbaz, which might be productive of misunder standing, leading to regrettable incidents. I propose therefore, if I cannot keep sarbaz quiet by further procrastination, to accept in bast few officers as representative. No. 285. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 26.)

I HAYE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from the acting British consul at Shiraz on the subject of the state of the roads in Ears, and on the gendarmerie now being organised by Swedish officers, I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 291. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. Sir, Shiraz, July 15, 1912. I VENTURE to offer some observations on the state of the roads in Ears, and on the gendarmerie now being organised by Swedish officers. Shiraz is mainly important for British trade as a depdt to which the exports of the province, such as opium and gum tragacanth, are brought from the districts for transport to Bushire, and as a distributing centre for merchandise imported via Bushire. The main outlets of this distributing centre are Ispahan, Yezd, and the districts of Ears. The last of these outlets is by far the most important, and is at present practically closed for regular trade, whether in exports or imports. The present satisfactory state of the Sarhad route under the guardianship of the Ilkhani of the Kashgais, makes a certain amount of retail trade possible with the villages along that road, but the volume of this trade is insignificant. The regions capable of absorbing foreign imports to Shiraz are eastern and south-eastern Ears, especially the latter. At present the Government does not possess even nominal authority in most parts of these regions, which are closed to regular ^caravan traffic. Occasionally a caravan, by paying heavy blackmail to Khamseh tribesmen, can, at considerable risk, circulate in parts of these regions, but the heavy rates of transport under such conditions, together with the attendant peril, render such trade of a precarious and not very profitable nature. The activity of the gendarmerie is, I understand, destined to be limited to the main road, and its efforts, successful or otherwise, would not143 directly affect eastern and south-eastern Fars. British trade cannot hope for any great revival, unless the districts are opened to local caravans and Shiraz pedlars. However, the success of the gendarmerie would open up two important outlets for Shiraz trade, namely Ispahan and Yezd, for, if the gendarmerie could succeed in establishing itself on the Ispahan postal road, little difficulty should be experienced in maintaining toleiable secunty on the short stretch of the Yezd road running from the Ispahan load just noith of Dehbid to Aberkuh. Moreover, the gendarmerie’s success on the main road would, both by the preliminary coercive measures necessary for its inception, and by the moral effect of the opening of the Bushire-Ispahan trade route, greatly strengthen the Government’s authority in the province generally, and must incidentally lead to an amelioration of the state of the outlying districts. Ihe main road between Bushire and Ispahan is now in a deplorable state. The Shiraz-Ispahan section is at present closed to caravan traffic, and even to travellers, except under escorts amounting to a military force. In the summer months the Arab tribes, who are entirely out of hand, render any regular traffic on that road impossible. In the winter months Lashanis, Chiharrahis, and miscellaneous brigands from the villages render the Shiraz-Dehbid section very insecure, but caravans under strong escort are able to circulate with occasional robberies. In the spring and autumn the Abadeh-Aminabad section is exposed to Kuhgelu depredations of monotonous regularity and on a large scale. Sarhadi villagers and the inhabitants of Shulgistan and other villages adjacent to the road also prey upon this section in the autumn, winter, and spring months. The arrival of the Kashgais in their northern quarters generally renders robberies in the summer between Abadeh and Aminabad unlikely without their connivance. With an ilkhani well disposed towards the Government, as is at present the case, the Abadeh—Aminabad section is relatively safe during the summer months. The vagaries of the Arabs, however, between Abadeh and Shiraz during these months compel caravans, to and from Ispahan, to use almost exclusively the Sarhad route. Even caravans to and from Yezd travel bv the Sarhad route, using a road running from Aberkuh through Surmek and joining the Sarhad route near Asepas. Since the break-up of the Government’s authority in Ears, the only roads in a relatively satisfactory condition have been those running: through Kashgai territory and almost exclusively under the control of that tribe. The Jirreh, Firuzabad, and Sarhad routes, even under an ilkhani on bad terms with the Government, were generally safe and subject to moderate rahdari, which was mainly confined to the control of one tribe. The Sarhad route this summer has proved no exception to the rule. Hahdari is of course levied, but not so exorbitantly as on the Bushire road, and caravans and the post have been able to pass in safety. The rates of hire, though high, compare favourably with the almost prohibitive prices prevailing on the Bushire road. The difficulty of the Bushire-Shiraz telegraph road lies in the lack of unity in_ its control. It is normally only disturbed between Kamarij and Shiraz, this section, dominated by the Kashgais, being the crux of the road question. In Novernber 1910, Soulet-ed-Dowleh was induced by the Central Government to abandon his policy of deflecting the traffic to the eastern by-roads and to assume responsibility for the Bushire telegraph route from Shiraz to the border of Kamarij territory. The results were most discouraging. Bobberies at once took place, and Soulet-ed-Dowleh, being unable to control the road without the assistance of the local headmen, was compelled to share the profits of rahdari with them. This naturally involved a large increase of this illegal imposition on the Shiraz-Kamarij section. From Kamarij to Bushire each local khan, of course, imposed similar taxes, with the result that the total exactions on the telegraph route were much in excess of the sums levied on the Jirreh or Firuzabad route. After the eclipse of Soulet-ed-Dowleh in October of last year the route from Shiraz to the Tang-i-Turkan was entrusted to the Kashkuli khans, and their chief, Mohammed Ali Khan, was made Governor of Kazerun. these khans continued the system of sharing rahdari profits with the local ^ headnaen. The road question was considerably complicated by the bitter local animosities resulting from iSizam-es- Sultaneh’s disastrous regime and by the disintegration of the Kashgais, who; 5 e^ petty chiefs, becoming increasingly independent of the ilkhani tended to exercise an irresponsible, extortionate, and multiple control of the road. Khurshid Khan had, until the spring of 1911, been in possession of the Tang-i-Turkan Bahdar, and the adjacent Shapur district, besides the valley of Kamarij. He had kept his section m admirable order, though he had of course levied rahdari like the other headmen a ong the road. Incited by Soulet-ed-Dowleh, Nizam-es-Sultaneh^made a futile wanton aggression against Kamarij. Khurshid was driven out, Kamarij plundered, and Shapur [1340] TJappropriated by Mohammed Ali Khan, who played a prominent part in these offensive operations. Khurshid succeeded in reinstating himself in the Kamarij valley, hut was unable to recover Shapur, which remained in the possession of Mohammed Ali Khan, together with the control of Rahdar and the northern end of the Tang-i-Turkan. ^ A number of Kamarij is, who had betrayed and fought against Khurshid, took lefuge with Mohammed Ali Khan. These exiles, whom Mohammed Ali Khan was compelled to con ciliate, have proved a fruitful source of trouble on the road by their extortionate exactions from caravans and their violent insolence towards muleteers and travellers. One of them, Ali Mohammed Kamarij, who is still in charge of the liahdar caravanserai, took part in the attack on our troops at that spot. On the other hand, Khurshid, who had suffered heavy pecuniary loss through Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s aggression, has been endeavouring to recuperate by increasing his exactions of rah dan and even by pilfering from caravans. Needless to say, the hostility existing between the guardians of two adjoining sections of the road greatly added to the uncertainty of that pait of the route. To make matters worse, the increasing bitterness of the Kazerunis against the Kashgais culminated in an open breach and the enforced retirement of Mohammed Ali Khan from the governorship of that town. The Kashkulis retaliated by deflecting the traffic from the Tang-i-Turkan to Shapur and thence via Naudan to Mian Kotal, thus depriving Kazerun of the profits to be reaped from passing caravans. This road is in the summer very trying for mules owing to the prevalence of fly-disease. Khurshid and the Kazerunis combined against the Kashgais and succeeded in passing a. number of caravans bv a very precipitous route from Kamarij to Kazerun via Bardoun, thus avoiding Rahdar altogether. These caravans, when, after Kazerun, they again passed through Kashgai jurisdiction, were made to pay very heavily for having avoided the Naudan route. This hostility between the settled population and the Kashgais has caused periodical blocks on the road and a general state of uncertainty, which, together with the heavy exactions of the roadguards and headmen, has raised the rate of hire to almost prohibitive figures. The Kashgais, since they began to migrate northwards, have been compelled to leave the road almost entirely in the hands ol the local headmen, to whom they have leased the road, section by section, from Shiraz to the Tang-i-Turkan vi&amp; Naudan. The headmen have to levy from caravans enough rahdari to pay for these leases and to make their own profit at the same time. It is not easy to ascertain the exact amount of the rahdari levied, for the muleteers exaggerate the figures in order to increase their rates of hire. Moreover, the exactions vary, Kazeruni muleteers being more heavily mulcted by the Kashgais than muleteers from other parts. On an average, however, it is probable that for a single journey the muleteers have to pay about 3 tomans a mule in rahdari. The road guards also help themselves freely to sugar and tea from the loads and even pilfer fitfully from other merchandise that takes their fancy. Fodder along the road is, of course, sold to the muleteers at extravagant prices. I have not failed to make continual and earnest representations to the local authorities regarding this deplorable state of affairs on the most important route for British trade in Persia. Without money or troops the local authorities are unable to take any heroic measures, and we can at present only hope for some slight palliatives to this disastrous situation. Any permanent improvement on the main road from Shiraz to Abadeh can only be effected by some sort of repressive action against the Arabs. If the Central Government grant permission, Kawam-ul-Mulk proposes to go out in person to deal with these turbulent tribes. He hopes to overawe the recalcitrant sections with the help of the relatively loyal chiefs and a force of Kashgais supplied by the ilkhani. It is very doubtful whether any efforts he can make will result in the opening of the northern postal route during this summer. Any permanent improvement on the Ahadeh-Aminabad section would only result from punitive measures against the Boir Ahmedi, and I see no possibility of such action in the near future, unless the Bakhtiaris could chastise this turbulent tribe. With regard to the Bushire road, it appears that the natural causes mentioned above, combined with Kawam-ul-Mulk’s incessant pressure and the Bardoun route development, have forced the Kashkulis’ hands. Mohammed Ali Khan has notified Kawam-ul-Mulk that the road guards have been withdrawn from the Naudan route, and Ali Mohammed Kamaraji at Rahdar has informed the muleteers that they can go by whatever route they wish. This will seem to indicate that the Kashkulis have at length acquiesced in a reversion to the main road. However, no permanent improve ment in the Kamarij-Shiraz section can, it would seem, be effected except by a compromise between the Kazernnis and the Kashgais or by restoring Kazerun to the Kashgais. For the first purpose it would be necessary that an impartial governorproceed to Kazerun as soon as possible. Nasir-ed-Diwan, the Kalentar of Kazerun, at present m eharge oi that town, is on the worst possible terms with the Kashkuli khans. With a neutral Governor at Kazerun the bitterness of the Kashkuhs might be moderated, and they might be more amenable. Howevei, the attitude of Mohammed Ali Khan, who, since the unpunished attacks on our troops, seems to ^ entertain exaggerated notions of his own power, is not encouraging. Piessure might be brought to bear on him through his fear of his cousin Mohammed Khan,^ who is hostile to him. Pressure of a different kind might be exercised against him and the other Kashkuli khans, as well as against their adversaries among the settled population on the telegraph route, by the temporary opening of the Jirreh route with^ the help of the Farsimadan Kashgais, who have been detained this summer in the neighbourhood of Shiraz as a protective measure. Both parties would suffer considerable pecuniary loss by the adoption of the Jirreh route, which might facilitate negotiations for a compromise. Failing such a compromise, the only solution would seem to be the forcible re-establishment of a Kashgai nominee in the governorship of Kazerun and the sacrifice of the special interests of the settled population in favour of the general interests of the road. This arrangement would not be easy to effect; it might cause serious complications and the temporary closing of the road ; it would, moreover, be very inequitable and objectionable for the undesirable increase it would cause in the already excessive power of the Kashgais. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that for several years the Kashgais have had control of Kazerun, and their resentment at their ejectment from that town is easily comprehensible. I have, in the course of informal conversations with Major Siefvert, endeavoured to explain to him the conditions prevailing on the road and the general political aspects of the province. It is, of course, impossible to expect European officers without any knowledge of the language or the peculiar conditions of the East to realise immediately the complicated situation in Fars. Major Siefvert appears to be a reasonable, energetic, and able officer, and I have no doubt that in time he will gain the experience necessary for the comprehension of the local situation. I venture to hope that the commencement of the gendarmerie operations will not be unduly precipitated. It would be much wiser to keep the gendarmerie in Shiraz, increasing its efficiency and numbers, than to risk a disastrous fiasco by premature action. Thus retained at Shiraz, the gendarmerie might gradually develop into a useful regular force, somewhat similar to the Cossack Brigade, v 7 hich would strengthen the Government’s authority, and could, as occasion arose, be used in co-operation with the Government’s irregular troops, for punitive expeditions, and in time be put out on the road. I have, &amp;c. W. A. SMART. No. 292. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 29, 1912. PERSIAN finances. Your telegram to St. Petersburgh of the 26th August. , , The Minister for Foreign Affairs urged to me yesterday that _ His Majesty s Government should at once advance the whole 100,0001. which the Persian Government understand they are holding in readiness for them. His Highness impressed upon me very earnestly Persia’s pressing want of immediate financial assistance on a larger sea e than the 50,0001. about to be advanced by the two Governments. He pointed out t at 10,000k of the British share had been allocated to Shiraz and that 15,000k o± the Russian share was retained on account of f he Kermanshah customs seized by I arman Parma, and that therefore half of the joint advance had to all intents and purposes disappeared as far as the Central Government was concerned. I replied that unless the Russian Government were prepared to act m a similar way I could hold out small hope of His Majesty’s Government agreeing to advance t le w o e 100,000k I hinted, however, that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps take into consideration the question of assisting Persia by relieving her, temporarily, at any rate, of some of her financial liabilities in the south. . i r i a I urged that no time should be lost in coming forward with proposals for a loan, and [1340] 1 2I told him that in my opinion these repeated small doles of money seemed to me an unsatisfactory way of helping Persia out of her financial difficulties. His Highness declared that the treasurer-general could produce sufficient available security for a large loan. No. 293. Sir W. Toivnley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 29, 1912. MY telegram of 25th August. Kermanshah situation appears to he very confused. Persian Government do not seem to know in whose name rebellious mujaheds have seized town, which they count on recovering with the help of Bakhtiari levies, of which 500 are with Farman Farina, 150 on the way from Sultanabad, and 350 to be dispatched from here. It is note- worthy that no reliance is to be placed on Governor-General and regular army. From information which has reached me it would seem money is as usual at the root of the movement. Farman Farma says all will he well if he gets 35,000 tomans (7,000Z.). Rebel leader promises the same result for 40,000 tomans (8,0001.). Both parties evidently mean to squeeze Government if possible. No. 294. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 30.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 30, 1912. MY telegram of 26th August.

I have been carefully considering the question of financing the Governor-General direct (see 3 7 our telegram of the 19th August). Excellent results might be obtained from such a policy. Of the sum of 10,000k which His Majesty’s Government recently advanced to the Persian Government, we paid 10,000 tomans (2,000k) to the new Governor-General in order that he might be enabled to start for his province. I here remains a sum of about 20,000 tomans (4,000k) in hand for his use on arrival at Shiraz. If we gave him a sum of from 2,000k to 3,000k a month for a year he would be able to raise a really useful military force by means of which he could maintain order in the province. He ought to have established himself firmly by the end of a year; he would then be able to collect all the revenue wdiich the needs of his administration require. _ Persian susceptibilities might be in some degree safeguarded by the money being paid through the treasurer-general to his agent in Shiraz and handed by the latter to the Governor-General in concert with His Majesty’s consul.147 No. 296.

Cox to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 2.) Sir, Bushire, August 11, 1912. I HAVE the honour to submit for your information a memorandum drawn up by Mr. H. G. Chick, my commercial adviser, on the recent history and present aspect of the all-important question of “ rahdari,” i.e., the forcible levy of blackmail on passing caravans by the headmen on the Bushire-Shiraz road, in the form of transit dues and exorbitant charges for forage, calculated to amount collectively to not less than 20,0001. per annum. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty’s Consul- General for Ears, &amp;c. Enclosure in No. 297. Memorandum on the Rahdari Question by Mr. H. G. Chick. THIS question is of fundamental importance at the present juncture, for there can be little doubt that “rahdari” and its prevention must be taken in hand before the restoration of order, either by the Persian gendarmerie or by our own troops. “Rahdari ” is, m fact, the governing factor in the existing situation along the load, and our hands are bound to be forced to action in regard to it, sooner or later. It may be convenient to record the recent history of the levy. “ Rahdari ” existed previous to 1900 in the form of small tolls of a few shams on caravans, levied almost entirely on the lower part of the road only, and at a few centres such as Borazjun: the toll was taken spasmodically, and by no means regularly, Ry the local khans at the stages, and payment of it entitled caravans to night watchmen, and to an escort of a few riflemen as far as the next stage. It is important to note that the sedentary tribesmen along the route were scantily armed up till 1900, after whic date arras from Muscat began to filter in. . 11 j i “ Alafi,” another toll, originally a grazing fee, is, I think, an older fee than “ rahdaribut it was formerly levied at certain seasons, and never made a permanent charge. The toll is now become another form of blackmail levied at the haltmg-stages by the khans from the muleteers through suppliers of fodder; it is usually recovered by the grant of a monopoly of supply to a single individual, who charges 1 or ‘2 krans, as it may be, over and above the price of fodder for each anima , or e benefit of the khans. It may also take the form of the supply of short weight of fodder to each animal, which is charged for at the full price of t e u wei j? ; i i i • Even in 1903, however, these exactions “rahdari” and “alafi irregularly levied as they were, were a sufficiently heavy tax to cause their abolishment to be made on the pact of the Persian Government one of the chief quid pro quos for the imposition of a higher customs tariff, and from the point of view of British interests this was the most valuable stipulation of any attached to the convention. ^ • In point of fact, however, the Persian Government were powerless to make good their engagements. The only authorities capable of stopping the exactions were the chiefs of the district through which the route passed, seven or eight m number, and, as they r , U 3 [1340]were in no wa.y benefited by the new tariff, they were in no way inclined to give up what constituted a valuable addition to their revenue. The Persian Government, when pressed to have the routes properly guarded, made the additional blunder of calling on their chiefs to provide riflemen, and omitting to arrange for their payment. This omission provided the khans with a convenient excuse for recovering the pay of their men, and making a large income for themselves from inordinate blackmail. Many protests have been made to the Persian provincial and central Governments by the residency here and by His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran since 1906. The Central Government, however, always replies that orders have been sent; but if sent, such orders are always disregarded ; and even the provincial Governments both at Bushire and Shiraz, continue to levy “ rahdari ” in one form or another on all mules arriving at Bushire and Shiraz, and to all protests at Bushire the reply is that they have no option as the Ministry of Finance continue to include such charges in the schedule of revenue of the town, and require the payment of it from local governors (a flagrant breach by the Central Government of its own undertaking of 1903). Since the end of 1906 the gradual and serious development of the system has continually exercised me, and I have collected all available information and statistics regarding it. The growth of oppression was gradual up to 1907, and rapid from the end of 1910. The following instances show the rise up to the present recorded in our monthly bulletins, obtained from local merchants :— June 1907 Per mule. Krans c. 3 70 June 1909 (approximately) 15 00 January 1910 .. 11 15 February 1910 .. 9 75 March 1910 9 35 April 1910 7 10 June 1910 • • 10 80 July 1910 10 50 August 1910 10 70 October 1910 13 62 January 1911 .. • .. 9 25 February 1911 .. 11 90 March 1911 11 00 April 1911 15 30 May 1911 12 95 June 1911 14 20 July 1911 16 35 September 1911.. 17 95 January 1912 .. 28 '12 March 1912 21 35 May 1912 « . 27 50 These sums represent only “rahdari” and “ tufangchigiri,” as it is called, and do not include “ alafi ”; they represent the enormous sum of 10s. for every 300 lbs. approximately, in addition to a rate of hire, which had risen by June 1912 to 34 tomans (over 61.) per 770 lbs. for a distance of some 180 miles, and this takes no account.of loss by pilferage. About the summer of 1910 the manner in which these exactions were levied changed considerably for the worse, and can best be accounted for by saying that for a period of nineteen months from March 1909 to December 1910 the caravan route was diverted by Soulet-ed-Dowleh to the Firuzabad and Jirreh routes (where caravans were treated more kindly) at the end of which time khans and tufangchis on the Kazerun road were missing their regular incomes and spoiling to get at caravans. By this time tufangchis from villages on the Kazerun route, nominally under the control of their khans, were primarily out to plunder a living for themselves; the khans relying on their men finding their own pay, while they themselves confined their incomes to larger extortions at the chief village passed in each district, he., Ahmedi, Borazjun, &amp;c. Auction of Stretches of Caravan Boute. But with Kashgai Ilkhani controlling the route to be followed, a system of “ auction ” of the right to secure passage of caravans came rapidly into'vogue with the smaller khans, more especially where alternative routes are possible. There are many examples of this system of auction—“ kharid ”—though most transactions remain secret to us. It started from the Bushire end of the road.149 In March 1907 the Khan of Angali bribed the Governor of Bushire with 500 tomans and a horse to divert the road from Borazjun to Shief, vice the land route via Ahmedi. In May 1907 the Governor of Bushire was being offered 4,000 tomans (800Z.) for the Shief route by the Angali Khan (who wanted to charge 1 kran for every three animals), while the price from the Khan of Ahmedi was 1,500 tomans (3001.). In consideration of the road passing by the land route, the governor also demanded an extra 2,200 tomans (440L) from the kalantar (who was to take it from caravans). Ultimately 1,700 tomans (340L) were paid by the Khan of Ahmedi, and a cheque for 4,000 tomans (actually seen by the writer in May 1907) returned to the Khan of Angali. In 1907 also the Khan of Borazjun took 5,000 tomans (1,0001.)from his tufangchis on account of “ rahdari ” from caravans ; but as long as Haidar Khan of Kumarij was master of the road from the first Kotal to Kazerun, and had it under one control (viz., till his death in September 1909), “ rahdari” was low, not more than 1^ krans per mule from Konar Takhteh to Kazerun. In March 1909 Soulet-ed-Dowleh undertook from certain Persian merchants in Shiraz and the Government of Pars to guarantee the safety of merchandise sent vH Firuzabad and his own tribal country on a monthly payment of 1,000 tomans (200Z.). Certain Persian merchants at Shiraz working for Soulet-ed-Dowleh arranged to take from all muleteers arriving at Shiraz'2|- krans (about Is.) on every mule. This sum was raised to 4 krans for the Jirreh route and again reduced by March 1910. It was reported then that the merchants engaged in collecting the impost in Shiraz “ have now found that a great deal more than 1,000 tomans per month was realised by the tax of 4 krans, and have reduced the payment to 2^ krans, which suffices to bring in a revenue of 1,000 tomans a-month to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. One Shiraz merchant had, in fact, offered to Soulet-ed-Dowleh to farm the road out for 2,500 tomabs (500Z.) per mensem, but the Ilkhani had replied ‘ no,’ that 1,000 tomans was quite sufficient, and he did not want unnecessary payments to be extorted from muleteers and traders. “ Under Soulet’s management, the khans of Daliki and Borazjun had been forced to reduce their charges ; formerly Daliki taxed mules to the tune of 3 krans per head, and the tufangchis another 2 krans out of the muleteers. Now, Daliki charged only 2 krans per mule, and had forbidden his tufangchis to take anything from the muleteers. Similarly Soulet-ed Dowleh had instructed the Kalantar of the ^ Farsimedan that he might charge only 5 shahis per mule at the three stages between Jirreh and Daliki. There had been friction between Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the Khan of Dashti over the section of the Firuzabad route through Dashti, the latter wishing to take more than half of the sum levied in Shiraz. Meanwhile, the khans from Daliki to Bushire were now willing to pay any sum to secure the reversion of the road to Jirreh by way of their districts. T e ans o Boraziun and Daliki paid Soulet-ed-Dowleh 3,000 tomans (600Z.) 1 T; 1 F ^ bru ^ r .y 19:1 j? for this privilege. The two khans (it should be remembered that the S le an 1 routes to Bushire branch off in Borazjun territory and are under t e contro o ^ t e former khan) then applied pressure on the Khan of Ahmedi to pay 700 tomans ( .) and a rifle as his share in the price, and on his refusal sent for the Khan of Angah and offered to divert the road via Shief for 1,000 tomans (200?.). , min At the time of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s visit to Bushire at the end of December 1910 the Darya Begi, then governor, stated “ Soulet-ed-Dowleh has taken 3,000 tomans (6001) and a horse from Sheikh Hussein Khan and given him permission to c arge £ rahdari.’ He also wishes to take 2,000 tomans (400?.) from Mustapha Tul-i-Siahi an give him permission to exact £ rahdari, • a x u i m i Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s official “ protection” of the road ceased^ m Sepember 1911 and the guardianship of the upper part of the road fell m o re 0 e n i chiefs, whose tribal sphere of migration touched most pom « on e between Shiraz and Kumarij. The object of the N.zam-es-Sultaneh s expedition agamst Kumarij in March 1911 was to obtain possession o us veiy s long pos caravan road for the Kashgai tribe, Soulet-ed-Dowleh having applied for Kumar j 1910, and the Kashkuli clan having long coveted it. Souiets selling o road to the sedentary khans applied to the road from Daliki downwards tl e . possibilities for the' Kashkulis of raising money lay over the road from Shira Kumarij^or to^Konar Takhteh^ ^ ^ ^ th wntel . at Shahpur that he was contempkting diverting the | h ^Th^^fb^ct theToad toKaTkuU exactionsUitheTva’yto Konar Takhteh. InNivember 1911 the Kashkuli encampment [1340] U 4had penetrated to the Khisht plain, with the object of further encroachments on the caravan road. In November also, while a guest with Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli, I met the khan of the Dushmanziari, to whom the Kashkuli khan then sold the “ protection” of the road from Chenar Kahdar to near Dashtarjin. From April 1911 the Kashkuli khans, despite their hostilities against Khurshid Khan on the Kumarij plain, insisted on all caravans passing by the Tang-i-Turkan, so as to pay “ rahdari ” at the ill-famed caravanserai at the Kazerun end of the pass. From that time till now the caravanserai has been held in force either by the Kashkulis themselves or leased out to their subordinates, such as Ali Mohammed, the Kumariji outlaw : and its commanding situation at the entrance to the ravine makes caravans an inevitable prey to its garrison. The details given above of the growth of “ rahdari ” and of the “ auction ” of stretches of the caravan route by dominant chiefs for the time being will, I hope, make it clear that the question of the security of the Bushire-Shiraz road goes deeper than the measures hitherto proposed for the remedy of its present condition can be said to penetrate. The following are instances of the insecurity of this road :— 1. The first European to traverse the road after the attack, was a young German merchant of Shiraz, Herr Roever, who came to Bushire to many his fiancee in early April. According'to his statements, he was held up at Diris, and was told by Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli that after the blood which had been shed it was lucky for him that he was not an Englishman; he was roughly treated at the Khwajeh Ibrahim caravan serai by tufangchis, and from the caravanserai to the mouth of the Tang-i-Turkan pass had to pay 25 tomans (51.), being menaced with a rifle at the last point. He stated that altogether he had had to pay 100 tomans (201.). 2. Mr. Lowen, an accountant of the Imperial Bank of Persia, proceeding to Shiraz, was able to start, early in April, as some thirty Persian sowars had been sent to Bushire by Kawam-ul-Mulk, for the purpose of escorting Lord Lamington to Shiraz, and he was able to return with them without being pestered by tufangchis. Yet his muleteers with him, he states, had to pay some 7 tomans (11. 5s.) per mule in blackmail. 3. Comte A. de Moustier and M. Viollet, proceeding from Tehran to the Gulf, had shots fired at them on the Kazerun plain and again at Jafferjin. They were much pestered by the tufangchis, and had to pay about 40 tomans (81.) in blackmail. In a written report, which was later forwarded to the French Legation, they complained of the dangers of the road. 4. Herr Heinicke and his wife, mother of Herr Boever, arrived from Shiraz in May. They were unable to pass from Kazerun by the usual route to Kumarij, but were taken up the Bah-i-Bardun route over the mountains and so down to the Kumarij plain, in order to avoid the caravanserai at the mouth of the Tang-i- Turkan, relations between Kazerun, Kumarij, and that post being strained. Thev had to pay about 15 tomans (3L) in exactions, mostly from Kumarij onwards, and Mme. Heinicke was insulted by tufangchis at Jafferjin. &gt; 5. At the end of May, some Indian servants and camp followers of the Central India Horse in Shiraz, accompanied by Beluchis, who belonged to a camel caravan robbed near Yezd in 1909, and who were returning to India after some years’ fruitless endeavour to get redress, were robbed at the Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai and at Jafferjin by tufangchis.

PERSIAN Government have handed to the two legations memorandum showing that advance of 50,000Z. would be of no use to them in their present financial difficulty, and asking that it may be increased to 200,000Z., half from each Government. It is shown that 40,000L is wanted for gendarmerie for five months, 25,000Z. for police of Tehran, 15,000Z. for maintenance of garrison at Tehran, 12,000L for Kermanshah army for two months, 3,500Z. for Cossack brigade at Tabriz for two months, 30,000L for arrears of pay due Government departments, 30,000L for purchase of arms and ammunition, and 40,000Z. for reorganisation of army. It is pointed out that nearly a half of the 200,000Z. lent last March has been spent on the gendarmerie, and that 40,0(J0Z. of it was repaid to Russia last July, and it is argued that Persia cannot continue reforms so satisfactorily started without money, and that to deprive her of financial assistance now would seriously jeopardise success of the reforms initiated. Memorandum states in conclusion that the advances would be repayable from loan which it is hoped to make shortly, for which application will be made this month. Scheme of army reorganisation has not yet been submitted to us. Falling off in southern customs receipts would, I think, justify request for some satisfactory assurance respecting railways as means of improvement of trade should His Majesty’s Government be disposed to entertain Persia’s request. .

Their number will then be reduced to what is sufficient to garrison guard towers. “ The above arrangements should be sufficient to restore order, and I trust I may be able to recommend that traffic along the road be resumed before the end of the present month.” I am congratulating Captain Grey on the share he has played in conciliating all parties.

We would remind your Highness that such a proceeding, should it be shown that our information is correct, does not appear to be in keeping with the arrangement made, with the details of which your Highness is familiar, under which the Persian Govern ment agreed as regards the engagement of foreign employes and officers to effect an exchange of views beforehand with the Russian and British Legations in order that an agreement should be arrived at.

THE statement recently made in the House of Commons, to the effect that it would appear improbable that any group of financiers could be found to make a loan to Persia m her present state of political and financial chaos without a British or Russian guarantee has aroused considerable resentment here. On the strength of a telegram from the Persian Minister in London, I am held responsible for having misinformed His Majesty’s Government as to the available resources that Persia could offer as security for a loan. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken to me reproachfully on the subject, and has represented that Persia could easily borrow money elsewhere than in England and Russia, if allowed to do so. I explained to Ala-es-Sultaneh that your reference was presumably to the insufficiency of the security produced by the treasurer-general for a loan of 6,000,000Z., a sum which it was thought represented the minimum of Persia’s wants to enable her to pay her debts and re-establish her financial house on such a footing of stability as would give promise that the money raised might have productive results. I have discussed the situation with M. Mornard, who is of opinion that the available resources of Persia should suffice to provide adequate security for a 6,000,000/. loan, but he owns that such an arrangement would absorb all Persia’s working capital and would leave her little or nothing to meet daily expenses. He added that he had not put forward any proposals since we discussed the possibilities of a loan last May, because he felt that if such a loan was to be devoted to the payment of claims, the creation of an army, and such like non-productive purposes, the state of Persia would be financially worse after the money had been obtained than at present. M. Mornard thought that there is good reason to hope that there will be a steady financial improvement as the working of his administration gets more firmly established, but he quite agreed that prospective increase of revenue is not an asset to set beforeEuropean financiers who may wish to examine the nature of the genuine resources that Persia may have to offer as a guarantee for a loan He considered that what would be most for Persia’s interests would be a smaller loan the objects of which should b e clearly defined, and that it should be more especially devoted to the furthering o proiects likely to he productive of increased revenue. He did not, apparently, a ac much importance to the real value that a small army would have m re-estab is ing order, and he expressed a hope that it might be found possible to postpone the settle ment of the claims bill until the country had had time to recuperate and reap some benefit from the capital that could be invested, if a loan were made on a reproductive scheme. I am of opinion that it will be extremely hard to arrive at a true and useful appreciation of the resources available for a loan, unless some person or persons more expert in such matters, and less busily occupied with other affairs than M. Poklews y and myself, were to come out and study the conditions on the spot. It is extremely difficult in a country where neither budget nor statistics exist to form an opinion of any value on the financial situation. The treasurer-general appears to be consistently hopeful about the success of the administrative schemes he has organised in and around Tehran, and augurs from this that similar methods of improving the mode of the collection of taxes should gradually give better. results m other parts of the country when they can be applied. j Since I commenced to write this despatch the Persian Government have had anew financial statement drawn up by the treasurer-general. It is their intention to distribute copies of this document—-which I have the honour to enclose tor your information—to the Persian representatives abroad, m order that they may be m a position to correct any wrong impression as to the financial status 0 * thls country which may have gained ground in Europe and the United States from the statement you made, Sir, in the House of Commons, to which a reference has previously been made in this despatch. A perusal of this paper wdl show _ that there are various discrepancies between it and the previous statement published in March last, a copy ot which accompanied Sir G. Barclay’s despatch of the 9th March. It will be seen that the estimated revenue from the customs, telegraphs, mint, excise, and other sources for the current year is put at 100,0001 higher minimum than it was calculated at last March, and that various new items figure m the hst, whereas the “ khalesseh,” or grain tax, collected in kind, figures with the “mahat ” as revenue reserved for administrative purposes. It will be noticed that, owing to the high P nc ® of silver and consequently small opportunity for minting, revenue under this head is reduced from 3,000,000 krans (60,000L) to 1,000,000 krans (20,000Z.). On the other hand, it is estimated that the excise on opium and alcohol will produce 5,000,000 kians (100,0001), instead of 1,400,000 krans (28,0001.). M. Mornard explains that this increased appreciation is justified by the fact that he has now been able to obtain a fuller control over the opium production, which, he says, may well develop very largely. . the situation of the northern customs continues satisfactory, but there is a consistent falling off, I understand, in the southern customs receipts. In a recent conversation the treasurer-general stated that he was meditating a small increase of the impoit duties all round. He argued that they average at the present about 7 per cent. ad valorem, whilst some articles almost escape duty altogether. He observed that his proposal would be so framed as neither to check imports nor increase the price of commodities for consumers. &lt; . . M. Mornard owns that it is extremely hard even for him to judge the situation accurately, but he professes to place faith in his calculations of revenue under the first heading, though I am somewhat sceptical as to some of the items. There must be a great deal of guesswork about the “ maliat ” returns, because M. Mornard has often confessed to me that many of the provinces produce nothing, and are a burden upon the Central Government, although in the case of some of them, such as Ears, they should produce considerable revenue available for national purposes beyond their own requirements, if only law and order could be re-established. Some provinces, such as Azerbaijan and Khorassan, have been productive until recently, but have now fallen off and have ceased to contribute to the public purse. Mr. Mornard told me that it was the intention of the Government to approach the two legations at an early date with proposals for a loan of 5,000,000/., but in the meantime he sincerely hoped that the two Governments would consent to make an advance of 200,000/. in order that he might be able to tide over the months that must elapse before a loan can be negotiated. He added that he would, all the same, sooner have no advance than one such as the last, which put him in the position of being unable toSir W.

Provincial Governors. —Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, who was reported in last month’s summary as having moved out of Tehran, did not actually leave the precincts of the capital till the 22nd August, when he left for Shiraz, with an escort of two Swedish officers and 100 men of the Treasury gendarmerie and some 200 sowars. Elections for the Medjliss.—Under the orders of the Central Government a committee of former deputies and notables was formed to consider the question of new elections, especially whether they were to be held in accordance with the Electoral Law passed by the last Medjliss, or whether they were to be carried out through electoral colleges, as was the case before. The committee decided that it would be unconstitu tional to alter the electoral system adopted by the last Medjliss; and as the Central Government consider it impossible to conduct elections on this system at present, the question of forming a new Medjliss has been dropped for the time being. Diplomatic Corps. —The new German Minister, Prince Henry XXXI of Reuss, arrived at Tehran on the 10th August, and presented his credentials to the Shah on the following day. Shall s Birthday. —The Shah’s birthday was celebrated on the 11th August. In the morning the corps diplomatique was received in audience, and in the evening the Prime Minister gave an official dinner. Government Gendarmerie. —The six Swedish officers, who left Stockholm in July for service with the gendarmerie, arrived in Tehran last month. Tabriz. The operations against the Shahsevans have been in progress throughout the last month, and, according to the latest report received from His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz, the tribesmen suffered a severe defeat in the latter half of August. The Russian casualties, however, have also been heavy, as some seventy killed and wounded were brought into Tabriz from Ardebil on the 23rd. On the 29th August, Sipahdar-i-Azam arrived at Baring, a suburb of the town, where he held a reception. Resht and Kazvin On the 10th August, 600 Cossacks and infantry arrived at Enzeli from Baku, of these, 200 left for Talish on the 31st. The Russian detachment of 100 men at Hamadan rejoined the force at Kazvin on the 7th August. Meshed. * There has been no change in the condition of the town and province during the last month. The Russian garrisons at Meshed and Kuchan have been reduced to 850 and 250 men respectively. Ispahan. The Sultanabad and Kum districts have been the chief centres of unrest of late. The governors of these places are without troops, and so unable to take any steps against the parties of banditti who infest the country.165 In spite of repeated representations made to the Central Government, the refugees, who took bast in the telegraph office last July, have not yet left. Sardar Jang arrived at Ispahan on the 1st August, and left on the 23rd to take up his duties as supreme ilkhani of the Bakhtiari tribe. Yezd. Entezam-ul-Mulk, who has been a disturbing element in Yezd territory for the past three months, and who, apparently, did not see his way to making his peace with the Government last July (vide last summary), entered Nain district at the beginning of last month and commenced raiding. 1 he deputy-governor of Ardistan, with a force of Bakhtiaris, took the field against Entezam and came up with him at Sarhangahad. In the action that took place, Entezam and five of his followers were killed and the rest fled. Ustad Mohammed, a leader of the revolutionary movement last year, was reported on the 11th August to be advancing towards Yezd, with a following of some 400 sowars. Shiraz. There has been no further fighting since the 5th of August, but Soulet’s levies still hold the hills in the vicinity of Shiraz, and traffic on the Bushire road is suspended. The Arab and Kashgai force collecting at Shiraz lias not yet moved out against Soulet. A consignment of cases for the Central India Horse, coming up from Bushire by the Firuzabad route, was plundered by some of Soulet’s followers, and Government, regimental, and private property, to the value of 165b, was carried off. Kerman. Amir Mufakham, the new Governor of Kerman, reached Yezd on the 26th August, but has not yet arrived at Kerman. Kermanshah. Owing to the depredations committed by Salar-ed-Dowleh’s followers and other parties of robbers at Kurdistan, Farman Farma commenced making preparations to move into the district with a view to restoring order. On the 15th August, on receipt of the news that Salar-ed-Dowleh was 40 miles from Kermanshah, Farman Farma left with his army for Sahna. On the 19th August, Yar Mohammed (vide summary for March) and 300 mujtaheds returned to Kermanshah, having deserted the Governor General. According to a telegram received from His Majesty’s consul, the mujtaheds have declared for Salar-ed-Dowleh ; but information received by the Central Government is to the effect that Yar Mohammed has published a manifesto, saying his return is in no way due to emnity towards Farman Farma, but that he and his followers desire the opening of the Medjliss and a change of Government. According to the latest reports, the town is quiet and in the hands of the mujtaheds. Bunder Abbas. A party of 100 Baharlu sowars arrived in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas on the 24th August, and robbed a British subject at Naiband, 2 miles from the town. On the following day they attacked the custom-house, and carried off six rifles and 800 tomans, and seized a large herd of cattle. The deputy governor sent his tofangchis out against them, but they apparently shirked meeting the tribesmen. On the 1st September the raiders left the district. No. 329. Sir W. Towniey to Sir Edward Grey.— (Received September 23.) g- r Tehran, September 4, 1912, ’ THE difficulties with which the Central Government have to contend in the province of Ears were further increased in the middle of August by the outbreak of [1340] X 4hostilities among the Arab tribes around Dehbid, in which an Arab chief was killed, The Arab chiefs in command of the contingents in Shiraz threatened to leave with their men to avenge the death of their relative. The Kawam-ul-Mulk endeavoured to persuade them to stay in the town, but sent for Basen and other Arab riflemen m case his persuasive efforts should prove unavailing. About the same date the followers of the rebel Soulet-ed-Dowleh made another descent on the Bushire road between Chenar Bahdar and Zeniyan, and plundered a Farsimadan donkey caravan. They raided Karabagh once more, thus compelling the Kawam to send thither a small force of Kashkulis. The Kashgais also showed activity by sacking on the night of the 13th August a large tea-house in Shiraz just behind His Majesty’s consulate. On the same day the Arabs plundered a large supply of wheat at the entrance to the town. In con sequence of this act the Kawam moved his Arab force 2 miles away from the town. In addition to these disorders a Kashkuli band was reported to be plundering just north of Shiraz as far as Zirghan. Mr. Smart reported that the chiefs, whether Khamseh or Kashgai, could no longer control their men in or outside the town, even when they evinced any desire to do so ; that the principal Baharlu chief had written to the Kawam that he had ceased to try to control his tribesmen, who were quite out of hand, and that the telegraph wire to the north and south were being cut daily. 130 ‘ : sarbaz” made their appearance at His Majesty’s consulate on the 14th August without warning with the intention of taking bast. Mr. Smart persuaded them to leave by taking ten of their number in bast pending an arrangement of their claim. In reporting these events Mr. Smart stated that the anarchy in the province was now beyond remedy with the means at the disposal of the local authorities ; not only Government authority, but also tribal authority, was in complete dissolution. The only hope of opening the Bushire road was to drive Soulet’s men out of Siakh ; the only chance of preserving order in the Shiraz Valley was to clear the tribal forces out of the valley on their expedition against Firuzabad. The Kawam was arranging for the passage of caravans by a detour through the Farsimadan pastures, thus avoiding the stage from Chenar Bahdar to Zeniyan. Ten days later Mr. Smart reported that two bands of Soulet’s adherents had made a fresh descent into Karabagh, one attempting to pillage a large village, from which they were repulsed by a Kashkuli post, the other proceeding along the valley and attacking 2 miles from Chenar Bahdar a snow caravan guarded by over a dozen village riflemen, one of whom was killed. This latter band carried off thirty mules, on which they loaded some plundered grain and returned to Siakh. This incident had two inconvenient aspects : firstly, that Shiraz was deprived of its snow supply ; and, secondly, it was clear that the enemy could reach the detour by which caravans had been avoiding the first dangerous stage of the Bushire road. British caravans were being warned not to pass Dastarjin without adequate special escort under chiefs which the Kawam periodically arranges. Soulet’s followers also plundered a consignment of cases for the Central India Horse coming up from Bushire by the Firuzabad route and Government, regimental, and private property to the value of about 165Z. was carried off. A consignment of 70,000 cartridges for the Fars Government coming from Bushire was also reported to have been seized by the villagers of Jarferjin and Konartakteh. The Kawam made strong representations to the Khan of JDaliki, in whose jurisdiction these villages are situated, for the recovery of the cartridges, but it was expected that these representations would be ineffectual, as the khan in question had just arbitrarily seized Cherun village, belonging to Kamarij. On account of the seizure of this village it was thought probable that the Khan of Shabancara, who is friendly with Kamarij, might attack the Khan of Daliki. The loss of the cartridges was very serious, as the Government would be compelled to buy cartridges locally at an exorbitant rate for the campaign. The Kamarij is and Kazerunis were also reported to be indulging in some fighting^ on their own account from Tanji Turkhan to near Kazerun against All Mohammed Kameriji. The latter was defeated and retired to Shapur ; in consequence of this disturbance caravans were again using the Bardoon route. I he Jabbara and Shaybani Arabs were also preparing for a fight, and were encamped in hostile formation opposite each other round Murghab. The Kawam had sent a messenger out to patch up a peace. The Shaybanis accused the deputy governor of the Arabs of having stirred up the discord, and demanded his recall to Shiraz. In view of this friction Mr. Smart thought that it was impossible for the Kawam to count on the Arabs in his campaign. The departure from Shiraz of over half of the Arab contingent had left the Kawam with a mixed Khamseh-Kashgai force of less than 1,000 men. Mohammed Khan Kashkuli was at Khani Zeniyan, where he, with a Farsimadanichief, was collecting Kashkuli and Farsimadani levies. Mr. Smart expressed the opinion that the loyalty of Mohammed All Khan, who had been much frightened by the pressure of the Kawam and of the ilkhani for the surrender of the culprits of the attacks on our troops, could not be counted on. He thought that, in view of the present confused situation and the Arab difficulty, the expedition against Firuzabad was for the moment inadvisable; the chiefs of the different contingents being all equals, there was no leader available whom they would all obey. Were the force to quail el over the spoil on the way, as would probably be the case, the expedition would result in a^ disaster. In addition, tribal levies sent at a distance from their tribes, must be paid regularly, and the expenses in that case would far exceed the funds available. Mr. Smart thought that, with the means now at the Kawam’s disposal, it would be wiser to aim only at the capture of Siakh, leaving there a small garrison until the ilkhani, within a month, could descend with the tribes. His authority would be accepted by the petty chiefs, and then the tribal riflemen, being close to their tribes, could be put in motion much less expensively. The ilkhani could then march on Firuzabad with much better chance of success, and even failure would not be so disastrous to the Shiraz Valley, as the tribes must then remain in the lowlands. Mr. Smart thought that a fiasco now would lay the Shiraz Valley open to the enemy. Mr. Smart spent the whole of the 22nd August in negotiations with the Kawam respecting the advance of 20,000 tomans (4,000L) for the campaign. The latter was besieged by tribal levies clamouring for pay. He finally induced the Kawam to agree to the following arrangement: of the sum of 20,000 tomans, 12,000 tomans (2,400L) to be paid to him on the 24th August, 3,000 tomans (600Z.) after the capture of Siakh, and 5,000 tomans (1,000Z.) after the arrival of the ilkhani on the scene, except in the case of grave emergency, when the last instalment would be paid sooner. The Kawam promised to dispatch 1,000 men to Siakh three days after payment of the 12,000 tomans. This was considered an adequate force, the enemy numbering, it was thought, 500 men. Mr. Smart expressed the opinion that this plan of campaign, though disappointing, compared with an immediate march on Firuzabad, was more prudent and would, if successful, at least open the Bushire road, and rid the Shiraz Valley of marauders. News has just been received of an attack on Lieutenant Fraser and a sowar on the night of Sunday the 1st September as the former was returning home from dining out. The incident occurred about half a-mile from the consulate. Fortunately Lieutenant Fraser succeeded in cutting his way through his half a dozen assailants with the help of his sowar’s sword, and neither he nor his attendant was wounded, though the latter’s waistband and coat sleeve were pierced by a bullet. The necessary representations have been made, Mr. Smart reports, to the local authorities, but so far the culprits have not been arrested. It was to be hoped that this outrage may prove an isolated event, but I have impressed the seriousness of such an incident upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs. T nflVP ArP ’ WALTER TOAVNLEY. No. 330. Sir IE. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received September 23.) Sir, Tehran, September 12, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram of to-day’s date, I have the honour to transmit copy of a memorandum that has been communicated to the two legations by the Persian Government showing the reasons why a loan of 50,000Z. would not suffice to meet Persia’s immediate necessities, and begging that the advance of that sum recently proposed by the British and Russian Governments may fie increased to 200,0001, half from each Government. It will be seen that the hope is expressed that the Persian Government - may shortly be able to make a loan from which this new advance would be refunded, and it is stated that a proposal in connection therewith will be* presented before the end of the current month. I have not had an occasion of consulting my Russian colleague since receiving the memorandum, but I may add that it is quite clear that the wants of the Persian Govern ment are very genuine, and that there is special reason to fear that the development of169 Quant aux conditions de rembonrsement, le Gouvernement s’engagerait a restituer ]a totalite de^ la somme de 200,0001. sur le prochain emprunt qu’il compte pouvoir conclure a breve echeance et dont le projet sera soumis a la Legation de Sa Majeste britannique dans le conrant dn present mois de septembre. (Translation.) IT is desirable to insist, with reference to the advance which His Britannic Majesty’s Government are prepared to make to the Persian Government, that the amount of this advance should not be less than 100,000L It is evident from the information given below that an advance of 25,000b, or even of 50,000b, would not be sufficient to secure the Government against the financial difficulties in which they at present find themselves in spite of the efforts which they are making and the success already achieved in the matter of the reorganisation of their finances in general. His Britannic Majesty’s Legation is aware that for some ten years Persia has constantly had recourse to loans for the purpose of balancing her annual budget and of meeting certain extraordinary expenses, such as the purchase of arms and ammunition. These loans are as follows :—• 1900, 5 per cent, gold loan of 20,000,000 roubles ; 1902, 5 per cent, gold loan of 12,500,000 roubles ; 1904, Indian 5 per cent, loan of 300,000b ; 1910, unification of various debts, 60,000,000 krans ; 1911, 5 per cent, loan of 1,250,000b ; or, altogether, 32,000,000 tomans borrowed and entirely spent in the period of twelve years. It is to be observed that at the end of the year 191L the whole of the last loan of 1,250,000b had been spent. At that date the treasurer had no funds in his hands, and he had no means of meeting current expenses except the daily receipts from the taxes and from the sale of Government corn, to which must be added a sum of about 250,000 tomans, being the available surplus of the customs on the 1st (14th) January, 1912 - . . i j It is true that in March the British and Russian Governments consented to advance to the Persian Government a sum of 200,000b, of which nearly half has been utilised for the maintenance of the gendarmerie up to the present date and about one-fifth had to be repaid two months ago out of the customs receipts. In reality, the Persian Government have only borrowed this year 1,000,000 tomans, while they have met the expense of the Kermanshah campaign and provided without intermission for the maintenance of the new gendarmerie corps. It may there ore e asserted that the present financial year, compared with the preceding one, srows distinct progress. , n n ^ „ This does not, of course, imply that Persia could proceed with the system of reforms recently devised without recourse to fresh loans. An attempt to do so would meet with certain failure, and would very shortly compromise the excellent results already attained both as regards the administration of taxes and the organisation o the gendarmerie. _ . ~ , -j au ^ In view of these important considerations, the Persian Government consider that it is absolutely necessary to borrow, in the form of an advance, a further sum o 200,000b, of which one-half only is requested of the British Government, and the ot er half of the Russian Government. , -r, • n , -i • , As regards the disposal of this sum of 200,0001., the Persian Government des.re to apply it in the following manner :— 1. Maintenance of the gendarmerie brigade for five months 2. ,, Tehran police for five months.. 3 # ” army at Kermanshah for two months 4 _ ’’ ?? garrison of Tehran for five months 5. Two months’ pay for the Cossack brigade at Tabriz 6. Arrears due to various Government administrations 7. Purchase of arms and ammunition 8. Reorganisation of the army 9. Various unforeseen expenses .. Total 200,000 120,000 70.000 75.000 18.000 150,000 150.000 200.000 117,000 .. 1 , 000,000 or, £200,000As regards the conditions of repayment, the Government would undertake to refund the whole sum of *200,000L out of the forthcoming loan which they expect to be able to raise shortly, a proposal in connection with which will be presented to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation in the course of this month of September.

Sazonof communicated to me to-day respecting British railway concessions in Persia. I have replied that the only railway concession of those mentioned for which we are pressing is the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line. I recognised that with regard to further railway concessions in the neutral zone we must discuss them with Russia This would not apply to a railway from Bunder-Abbas to Kerman or any other in the British sphere. To this M. Sazonof agreed. He recognised that the Mohammerah- Khoremabad railway was essential for our trade, and he would not oppose it. I have told M. Sazonof that the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line stands apart from the others in the neutral zone. As regards the others, we might ask Russia at any time later on to consent to them, but we could not claim her consent to them as a matter of right until the trans-Persian railway proceeded beyond Russian sphere, and then apparently the actual condition was some international basis. . I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 333. Memorandum. UN syndicat anglais (Messrs. Greenway, Seligman, Lynch) a presents au Gouvernement persan un projet de construction d’un reseau de chemins de fer dans le sud de la Perse, projet se rdsumant en traits generaux aux points suivants :— 1. Emission par la Perse d’obligations garanties par les lignes de chemin de fer elles-m6mes et leurs revenus, ainsi que par les revenus douaniers et autres revenus du Gouvernement persan, au choix du syndicat.m 2. Construction des lignes de chemin de fer - (a.) De Mohammerah ou de Khor-Mousa a Khorremabad on Bouroudjird (ce dernier point situe dans la zone russe). (6.) De Bender-Abbas a Kerman. (c.) „ ,, Cbiraz. {d.) „ ,, Mobammerah. 3. Droit de construire des ports dans chacune des villes maritimes susmentionnees. 4. Option pour la construction de prolongations de ces lignes ou de toutes autres lignes dans le sud de la Perse. Ce projet entramerait une augmentation considerable de la dette publique en Perse, ce qui ne manquerait pas d’avoir de graves inconvenients, eu egard aux engagements financiers deja contractes par ce pays envers la Bussie et I’Angleterre. En tout cas, la garantie des obligations par “ les revenus douaniers et autres,” deja afifectes au service des emprunts anterieurs ou constituant la seule source de revenus susceptibles de garantir le grand emprunt dont il est question en ce moment, souleve de serieuses objections. Sans entrer dans les details du projet mentionne, qui demandent une etude plus approfondie, on ne saurait passer sous silence que Texploitation de la zone neutre etant egalement ouverte aux capitaux des deux pays, toute absorption plus ou moins exclusive des chemins de fer dans cette zone serait peu conforme a fesprit de la convention de 1907. Quant au projet de faire eventuellement aboutir une des lignes a Bouroudjird, ville rentrant dans la zone russe, ce projet serait en contradiction avec les principes memes de cette convention. II semblerait, par consequent, fort opportun de soumettre le projet elabore par le syndicat a un examen prealable de la part des Gouvernements de Grande-Bretagne et de Russie. (Translation.) AN English syndicate (Messrs, Greenway, Seligman, and Lynch) have submitted to the Persian Government a proposal for the construction of a system of railways in South Persia, which may be summarised generally as follows:— 1. Issue by Persia of bonds secured on the railways themselves and their revenues, as well as on the customs and other revenues of the Persian Government, at the option of the syndicate. 2. Construction of railways— {a.) From Mohammerah or Khor Musa to Khoremabad or Burujird (this latter point being in the Russian zone). {Id.) From Bunder Abbas to Kerman. (c.) From Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. (d.) From Bunder Abbas to Mohammerah. 3. The right to construct ports in each of the above-mentioned coast towns. 4. The option for the construction of extensions of these lines or of any other lines in South Persia. This scheme would entail a considerable increase of the public indebtedness in Persia, which could not fail to involve serious inconveniences, having legal cl to the financial engagements already contracted by that country with Russia and England. In any case, the securing of the bonds on the customs and othei revenues already assigned as security for previous loans, or forming the only source of xevenues capable of serving as security for the large loan now under discussion, is open to grave objection. . . Without entering into the details of the scheme, which lequne closci study, it must be observed that, the exploitation of the neutral zone being open to the capital of both countries equally, the more or less exclusive monopoly of the light to constiuct railways in that zone would hardly be in conformity with the spirit of the convention of 1907. As for the proposal to make one of the lines end at Burujird, which is situated within the Russian zone, this would be contrary to the very principles of that ^ if would therefore seem to be very desirable that the syndicate’s scheme should be submitted to a preliminary examination by the British and Russian Governments.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

LA Societe d’Etudes, constituee en vue de tenter la construction d’un chemin de fer transiranien, a songe dernierement a Pexecution partielle de ce projet sans attendre qu’une decision definitive soit prise quant a la .realisation du projet. Dans cet ordre d’idees il s’agirait d’entreprendre des maintenant la construction d’une ligne, qui, partant d’Alat sur le Transcaucasien, irait jusqu’a Teheran et constituerait ainsi une partie du trongon russe de la grande ligne projetee. En principe, ie Gouvernement . Imperial serait pret a admettre une semhlable solution. La Societe d’Etudes a, parait-il, Tintention d’entamer a cet effet des pourparlers avec le Gouvernement persan tant au sujet des recherches prealables a executer sur les liens: que de Toption a obtenir pour les lignes qui 1’interessent. Considerant que, par elle-meme, Toption obtenue n’implique pas encore la construction effective des voies visees, le Gouvernement Imperial aime a croire que le Gquvernement britannique ne verra, de son cote, aucune objection a ce que la Societe d’Etudes obtienne 1’option en question, car, le cas echeant, ladite societe restera libre de ne point user du droit acquis pour ce qui concerne le trongon anglais du chemin de fer. Le Gouvernement Imperial espere, par consequent, que rien n’empechera les representants britannique et russe a Teheran d’appuyer, tons les deux, les demarches de la societe dans le sens precite. Ahn de faciliter Theureuse issue de ces demarches, il serait desirable d’encourager la Societe d Etudes a faire simultanement des offres serieuses au Gouvernement persan en vue de realiser le grand emprunt dont il a besoin. (Translation.) THE Sociffte d’Etudes, formed with a view to the construction of a trans-Persian railway, has lately considered the question of partially carrying out this scheme without awaiting a final decision in regard to its complete realisation. The idea would be to undertake at once the construction of a line which, starting from Alat, on the Trans- Caucasus Railway, wuuld run as far as Tehran, and would thus form a part of the Russian section of the great railway proposed. The Imperial Government would be ready, in principle, to allow a solution of this kind. I he bocidte d Etudes intends, it appears, to enter into negotiations with the Persian Government with this object, both as regards the preliminary investigations to be rnade on the spot and as regards the option to be obtained for the lines in which it is interested. As the option, when obtained, would not by itself imply the actual construction of the lines in question, the Imperial Government hope that the British Government will also see no objection to the Society d’Etudes obtaining the option referred to, since, if necessary, the socihtb will be free to abstain from exercising its lights as regards the English section of the railway. The Imperial Government hope, therefore, that nothing will prevent the British and Russian representatives at Tehran from supporting together the action taken by the soci^td in the sense above described. In ordei that this action may have a better prospect of success, it is desirable to induce the Societe d Etudes to make to the Persian Government at the same time a serious offei with a view to their obtaining the large loan of which they are in need.173 No. 335. Sir E. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. Sir, Balmoral, September 25, 1912. I HAD some conversation with M. Sazonof to-day on the subject of Persia, and pointed out on the map how large the Russian sphere was as compared with the British. I said that what people here felt was that the changes since the Anglo-Russian Convention had been to our disadvantage, Russia was now in military occupation of some portions of northern Persia ; her shadow was thereby thrown right across the north, that inevitably made her influence predominant at Tehran, and ours corre spondingly less; and all this made it more than ever essential that we should be quite sure as regards the rest of Persia, and especially with regard to our commercial interests in the neutral zone ; that Persian governors should be supported by the Central Government in protecting these interests ; and that the Russian Minister at Tehran should never work against them. As long as M. Poklewsky was there we were sure this would be safe. M. Sazonof said that whatever Russian Minister was there, his instructions would always be the same, to act as M. Poklewsky had done in this respect. No. 336. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received September 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 25, 1912. MY telegram of 19th September. _ i i r • Difficulties of Persian Government have been increased by the defection of Bakhtiaris and Armenian mujaheds, in all about 800 men, who have left Kermanshah on the way to Tehran. They have refused to fight any more, and have reached Kangavar, where they have consented to await the arrival of reliefs. Unfortunately Government is not in a position to send more than 150 Bakhtiaris from capital, and it is said that none are available from their own country. . If the matter cannot be arranged situation _ will be a serious _ one, because Government forces are not of much fighting value without these auxiliaries. It ^ said that Salar-ed -Dowleh was able to escape to Senneh because these troops refused to fight. Reason given for their action is that rhey have been fighting for a constitution and a Medjlissfbut refuse to continue to do so when the former is ignored and there is no hope of latter being summoned.

Salar-ed-Dowleh is reported to have left Senneh with a force of about 7,000 men, chiefly tribesmen who have rallied to his standard. It is not clear whether he intends to march on Kermanshah or Hamadan. Whereabouts of Farman Farma and Govern ment forces is also doubtful. One report says that he is preparing to take bast with all his men in consulates at Kermanshah. Another has it that he is with Bakhtiaris and Mujaheds at Kahgavar. there is a panic at Hamadan, whence Mujaheds under Kerri are reported to have telegraphed to Tehran that they refuse to fight because there is no Medjliss and are returning to Tehran. Bakhtiaris also refuse to fight for same reason. My Russian colleague and I have made urgent representations that Bakhtiari reinforcements should be sent at once under a capable leader. No. 339.

Sazonof began with a reference to the Trans-Persian Railway, and the question of an option for the Societe d’Etudes, on which I had asked him to obtain Lord Crewe’s view. His Lordship said that the proposal appeared to be for a limited option, and when M. Sazonof asked what that meant, answered that he could not call it a full option if it remained in our power to defer indefinitely the construction of the line in our sphere of influence. M. Sazonof agreed that this was so, that the option was simply foi the Societe d Etudes, not for the construction of the line, meaning that if and when construction took place it should not be through any other agency. Lord Crewe said that in that case he saw no difficulty in agreeing. As regards the Mohammerah- Khoremabad line, M. Sazonof said that it ought to be made a joint arrangement between the two countries.

Concerning the possible extension of the line to Burujird, situated in the Russian sphere, a means of obviating any difficulty in the matter might be found if the Russian Government invoked the aid of British capital for the construction of the part in the Russian sphere, or for a line from Khoremabad to Ispahan, thereby rendering less important the branch from Khanikin to Tehran. With regard to further railway concessions in the neutral zone, His Majesty’s Government are quite prepared to discuss the matter with the Russian Government, and to request the syndicate to send out a representative to St. Petersburgh. His Majesty’s Government may ask Russia to consent to them in due course, it being understood that such consent would not be claimed as a matter of right until the Trans-Persian Railway shall have proceeded beyond the Russian sphere. As to railways in the British sphere such as Bunder Abbas to Kerman, His Majesty’s Government have no doubt that the Imperial Russian Government will admit that these are matters solely affecting British interests, but His Majesty’s Government would always be happy to keep the Imperial Russian Government informed of any project of railway enterprise in the British sphere. Any increase of the Persian public debt due to the construction of railways in the neutral zone may fittingly be dealt with in discussion between the two Governments. No. 345. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. Sir, Foreign Office, October 4, 1912. WITH reference to my despatch of the 24th ultimo, I transmit to your Excellency herewith a copy of a memorandum setting forth the views of His Majesty’s Govern ment in regard to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, with which I have to-day furnished the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 345. Memorandum. HIS Majesty’s Government share the view of the Russian Government that it is desirable to occupy the ground by securing an option for the Societe d’Etudes, whereby the two Governments will be in a position to say when and where a trans- Persian line would be built. His Majesty’s Government have therefore no objection to the Russian Govern ment constructing a line to Tehran, and, subject to all the reserves and conditions already stipulated as to the route of the railway outside the Russian sphere, and that it shall not, without agreement with His Majesty’s Government, proceed beyond the Russian sphere, have authorised his Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, to co-operate with his Russian colleague to secure the said option for the Societe d’Etudes. 4he British group of the Societe d’Etudes have also been informed that they would be justified in sending to Tehran a representative to co-operate with representa tives of the other groups of the societe to the same end. As regards^ the • suggestion that the societe should be encouraged to make a big loan to the Persian Government, such action appears somewhat difficult, as there is to be no Anglo-Russian guarantee. No. 346. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) ^ Foreign Office, October 5, 1912. IT is essential that a strong Government should be established in Persia. I agreed with M, Sazonof when he w T as in England that Saad-ed-Dowleh is the only177 Persian who is likely to be able to restore order in the country, although I am aware that his past record is not perfect. Your Excellency should now ask M. Sazonof whether he will instruct M. Poklewsky to join Sir AY. Townley in supporting Saad’s appointment as Prime Minister. The conditions of the appointment should, I think, be (1) an undertaking by Saad not to place obstacles in the way of the effective and honest administration of the finances of Persia; and (2) an assurance that, in this event, both he and the governors appointed by him will receive the moral support of both Governments and of their agents in all parts of Persia.

The latter had begun by asking that the Russian and British Governments should give a guarantee, but he had replied that this was out of the question. He had suggested to them, however, that the financial question should be investigated by the experts who are going out to Persia on behalf of the Trans-Persian Railway (“ Comite d’Etudes ”); they might then try to ascertain whether there were not some source of revenue available for a guarantee. To this suggestion the English and French representatives had replied that it would, in their view, be preferable that financial agents of the groups themselves should proceed to Persia. M. Sazonof said that in that case it would be very desirable for the financial experts to be sent out with the representatives of the Comite d’Etudes immediately.

Information has reached my Russian colleague, who has not yet returned to town from the summer legation at Zerguendeh, that Salar is approaching Tehran, and that he is actually within 40 miles of the town. M. Poklewsky fears that grave disorders may ensue as he thinks that Salar would never have ventured on this daring move unless he had supporters within the walls upon whom he can rely. He suspects the democrats and mujaheds here of being in league with Salar. He has, therefore, warned the Russian general at Kazvin to be prepared to march on Tehran at a moment’s notice, and has told him that in the event of telegraphic and telephonic communications being interrupted he should move at once without instructions. He wrote all the above to me late last night. I told, him that personally I did not anticipate serious trouble, but that I quite concurred in his communication to the Russian general as a precautionary measure. The Persian Government do not themselves know Salar’s exact whereabouts nor the number of his followers, but as he seems to have travelled at great speed this is piobably small. My own information is to the effect that he is somewhere in the triangle formed by Hamadan, Kazvin, and Tehran. There is naturally considerable excitement^ in the town at the rumoured near approach of the Prince, aiid there is also no little dissatisfaction with the present administration, but, though the occasion might easily be utilised for the organisation of a demonstration against the Bakhtiaris and the Government, I cannot ascertain that there is any serious danger of a popular movement in the I rince s favour.

Tehran, September 29, 1912. IN my despatch of the 4th September I had the honour to describe the state of anarchy prevailing in the neighbourhood of Shiraz during the period immedi- ately preceding that date. I regret to have to state that since the above-mentioned report was wwitten there has been no improvement to chronicle in the condition of the province and that the warring factions of the Ivashgai tribes continue to be the principal factor in making the situation in Pars extremely disquieting. On the /th September Mr. Smart reported that Soulet-es-Sultaneh had endeavoured to bring his own tribe to the assistance of his rebel brother, Soulet-ed-Dowleh. This attempt was frustrated by the ilkhani’s full brother, Salar Hishmet, who attacked and defeated him near Asepas and detained the tribe. Soulet-es-Sultaneh fled with a few men to Baiza where he found support from several smaller tribes who were in revolt against the ilkhani s attempt to exact maliat. From Baiza he commenced intrigues with Soulet-ed-Dowleh s lieutenant at Siakh. Mr. Smart expressed the opinion that the whole revolt^ appeared to be a question of taxes, the revolting tribes seeming to want Soulet-es-Sultaneh as ilkhani in preference to Sardar Ehteshem, knowing the former to be too weak to press for taxes. Negotiations between Soulet-es-Sultaneh and the ilkhani, Sardar Ehteshem, then appear to have been conducted at Baiza whither the notorious Mohammed Ali also proceeded with a force. Though it did not appear that the latter had decided to throw in his lot with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, he had been much alarmed by the defeat of Soulet-es- Sultaneh and the consequent advance of the ilkhani. During the negotiations at Baiza he appeals to have thrown his whole weight on the side of Soulet-es-Sultaneh and to ha\e imposed unacceptable conditions on Sardar Ehteshem in consequence of which the new and entirely unexpected development has arisen of the resignation of the latter from the ilkhaniship. . ^ -^ ew days pieyious to this event Mudabber-es-Sultaneh, the Deputy Governor of Shiraz, and Musteshir-ul-Mulk, a large landowner in Ears and a man who has taken a183 considerable part in local politics, went ont to Guyum to endeavour to reconcile Soiilet-es-Sultaneh and the ilkhani: they failed to do so. On the 25th September on returning to Shiraz they were attacked by Kashkulis apparently partisans of Soulet-es- Suitaneh. Mudabber escaped but Musteshir was made prisoner. Now that the ilkhani has resigned Mohammed Ali and Soulet-es-Sultanehhave sent emphatic assurances of loyalty to the Kawam-ul-Mulk requesting the latter’s instructions and promising reparation for the unauthorised attack on Mudabber-es-Sultaneh. Soulet-es-Sultaneh has also informed Kawam that he has rejected Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s advances for an alliance. With regard to the ilkhaniship, Haji Mohammed Kerim Khan, who is with Soulet- es-Sultaneh and Mohammed Ali, has written to Kawam that the Kashgai tribes will no longer obey any ilkhani of the ruling family, and suggesting the appointment of Nasr- ed-Dowleh, a son of Kawam by a Kashgai mother, as ilkhani. Kawam has rejected the proposal, and has telegraphed to the Central Government suggesting that Soulet-es- Sultaneh, without being nominated ilkhani, should be entrusted to the care of the Kashgai tribes until the new Governor-General arrives at his post, and can come to some suitable decision. Mr. Smart’s opinion is that the disintegration of the Kashgais is now complete; that the attempt of Sardar Ehteshem to re-establish the authority of the ilkhaniship, and to collect maliat, has signally failed ; that there seems, at present, no man strong enough to renew the attempt, and that the Government will probably be compelled to divide up the tribes under several chiefs. _ The most unsatisfactory feature of the situation appears to be that Mohammed An seems, for the moment, to have recovered lost ground. He has now overthrown two ilkhanis, and is posing as a king-maker. _ a i + i As regards the position of the Government army which wms to oppose boulet-ecL- Dowleh, the force, mainly composed of Kashgais, was encamped on the 7th September round Chenar Rahdar, where it had been halted with a view to blocking the way of the revolted tribes. Kawam-ul-Mulk maintained that it could not advance on Siakh un i the ilkhani reached Baiza, from which point the southward movement of the tribes could be controlled. „ , On the 27th September, however, Mr. Smart reported that the Government armj had returned to Shiraz refusing to remain in the field without pay, and that Soulet-ea- Dowleh had moved his force to a spot half way between Chenar Rahdar and Khaneh Zinian. The approaches to Shiraz are now unprotected : there are, however, hopes that, owing to the advanced season, the Kashgais will hasten southwards wnhout creating serious disorders in the Shiraz valley ; this hope is encouraged by the fact that the tribes seem determined not to fight pour les beaux yeux of any member of the ruhnf femdy.^ ^ show that Kashgai riflemen are plundering in and around the city, though the presence in Shiraz of some half-dozen Kas1 ^ T TG to are very friendlv to the British, renders, in Mr. Smart s opinion, any serious dange ,h * meidenta h -JJ«J in my telegram of tbe 29th September, the mana^ei 0 Seutember and Persia, his wife and child, were returning home at sunset on the 2Sth bep ^ ^ ^ were attacked just outside the gate of their house y a ou &gt; , . i ’ i KasWs armed with rifles and sticks.

Telegraphic interruptions in the province of Fars are reported to have been more frequent than ever of late. There have been interruptions between Dashtarjin and Mian Xotal caused by Farsimadan Kashgais. Repeated orders to the Khans to prevent damage have proved unavailing, the tribesmen being wholly out of hand. Arabs and Basens are smashing the lines between Sivend and Shiraz ; Kashgais are doing the same between Shiraz and Khaneh Zinian. Gholams sent out to north or south to repair the lines are maltreated and stripped. Insulators, stalks, brackets and stays are being carried off wholesale and miles of wire are being removed. On the 25th September Mr. Smart reported that the Bushire and Ispahan roads were ^ closed for the moment and that no posts had come through from Bushire for a fortnight. A large caravan of pilgrims which has started for Bushire had been obliged to return to Shiraz. It w iB thus be seen that the situation in the province of Fars is a most unsatisfactory one. It should, however, be borne in mind that the present is a moment when disturbances may be expected as the tribes are on the move from their summer to their wmter quarters. The advent of a new Governor-General is, moreover, frequently the signal m Persia for disorders to break out or be renewed. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWKLEY. No. 368. Su IF.

Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived October 21.) Tehran, October 2, 1912. THE situation at Kermanshah and in the neighbourhood of that place affords a further proof of the incapability of the Persian Government and of its military executive to restore and maintain order, even in a part of the country where the Government forces appeared to have obtained a complete mastery some three or four months ago. y[ 0 ver y serious attempt would appear to have been made at the time of the reoccupa tion of Kermanshah to capture Salar-ed-Dowleh, and during the past few months the appearance of the ubiquitous Pretender has been reported from various places in Luristan and Kurdistan. Owing to the lack of telegraphic communication and to the absence of reliable agents in the districts frequented, it has been extremely difficult to locate the exact whereabouts of the elusive Prince. It will be remembered that as soon as Kermanshah had been recaptured and balar- ed-Dowleh had been driven out to wander a fugitive among the wild tribes of Luristan and Kurdistan, the Bakhtiari and mujahed forces withFarman Farma began to clamour loudly for permission to return to Tehran, since there was no more fighting to be anti cipated. In July it was reported that they had actually marched out of Kermanshah on their homeward journey. They then halted at Bisitun, and consented to return to Kermanshah on receipt of money from the Central Government, which enabled the arrears of pay due to them to be paid up to date. Complaints were also made at the time that all the spoils of war went to enrich Farman Farma, and that neither the Government nor the men who had won the victories for him received any share. Early in August, Farman Farma with the whole of his army marched, leaving a quite inadequate force at Kermanshah, to Senneh, the capital of Kurdistan of which yovince le is also Governor-General. Whilst the Government forces were on the march to bemieh, a certain Yar Mohammed Khan deserted Farman Farma, and returned to Kermanshah at the head of about 300 Mussulman mujaheds. He would appear to have got possession of Kermanshah by a ruse, and to have occupied the city, from whence he telegrap Tehran that he and his men had forsaken Farman Farma because they wished the Bep-ent to be dismissed, the Cabinet to be changed, the constitution to be maintained, ^nd 8 : Medjts to be summoned. It was earty rumoured that Yar Mo^ = d^ntended t declare for Salar-ed-Dolweh, as was proved when the Prince on the 3rd September at the head of 500 men, and was warmly welcomed by the ex-democrat, Yar Mohammed, now turned rebel and trai or. , Govern- Before it was quite clear which side Yar Mohammed Tjprik ment dispatched a young Armenian named irza anz, j }}, t0 pa t c h Khan’s “chef de cabinet ” to the army in the hope that he might be ameto parcn un the differences between the Mussulman mujahed deserters and the Aimenmns up the ditterences netweei Mirza Yanz arrived too late to effect who had remained faithful ^ 1 ,^ 11 ^ and it wou ld appear that his mission the purpose for which he had been dispatched an^ ^ ^ ^ ^ -iiS'lf ItoTrii Wt h, h» Ao U„„lf »itb th, with that of a sort of covering manifesto issued by t Mohammed Ali Mirza, Ik, Persian people will not again ““rf.g ,1.. p»pl.'e desire for tk.

No sooner was Farman Farma re-established in Kermanshah than the Bakhtiaris and mujaheds declared that they would not fight any more, and actually deserted the town with the avowed intention of returning to Tehran. They had already reached Kangavar when they were persuaded by the remonstrances of the khans at Tehran to await there the arrival of Bakhtiari reliefs, which it was promised should be dispatched at once. Unfortunately, these reinforcements are not forthcoming, as it has not been found possible to muster more than about 150 men at Tehran, whilst no recruits are available from Bakhtiaristan at this period of the year. There is said to be a small Bakhtiari force between Sultanabad and Hamadan. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that these men have been ordered to the front, but some people seem to doubt their existence. Under these conditions, my Russian colleague and I deemed it advisable to make a strong representation to the Bakhtiari Prime Minister and Minister of War to the effect that, if they cannot persuade their tribesmen at the front to do their duty and refrain from meddling in politics, we shall feel constrained to withdraw our support from the Bakhtiaris, both at the capital and in the provinces. Our representations would appear to have borne fruit, because we are now assured that a portion of the force at Kangavar will return to Kermanshah, whilst the remainder will proceed to Hamadan to strengthen the garrison there. Reports from the front are extremely conflicting, but it would appear established that Salar-ed-Dowleh has succeeded in collecting again a considerable force of tribesmen round him, and that he has left Senneh either for Kermanshah or Hamadan. His army is estimated at 7,000 men, which is probably an exaggeration, and he has one mountain gun. balar-ed-Dowleh would now appear to have somewhat changed his tune. He is said to have disavowed all pretensions to the throne, to which he owns that he has no claim, and poses as a champion of the independence of Persia under a constitutional Government. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 370. Copy of Letter from Persian United Associates. (To the Cabinet. Copy to Sardar Assad, and copy through the Dashnaksutiun to the Diplomatic Body.) IT is of course well known to the Ministry that each member of the army has, from the beginning of the constitutional era, everywhere and at all times supported the independence of the State and protected the constitution. In pursuance of this sacred purpose we have sacrificed ourselves. We have made war and gained great victories such as the victories of Tehran, Ghilan, Zenjan, Karachedagh, Ardebil, Mazanderan,’ Astrabad, Arshad-ed-Dowleh, Salar-ed-Dowleh, &amp;c., up to the end. Each individual is still of the same persuasion and will sacrifice himself, and we are convinced that the Cabinet holds the same sacred views as the army. Seven months ago the Government were forced, on account of external difficulties, to close the Medjhss, and this army corps approved this course and assisted in the execution on_ account of expediency. The Medjliss was closed; the Cabinet gave explicit promises that the Medjliss would be reopened after the lapse of three months Seven months have now passed since that promise was made and there is no sign of the reopening of the Medjliss. This has caused us disappointment, and therefore the individual members of the army in general, and the superior and minor officers in particular, ask the Government to open Parliament, to give exceptionally stringent orders for the hoiding of elections, and to institute Parliament in a very short time I his will bring about contentment m the country and render the army grateful.

As the circular, and only a small nu ■ jthis source of supply has now ceased entirely, Colonel Hjalmarson has decided to select his officers from among the under-officers of the gendarmerie, and, in order to ensure a continuous course of instruction, has amalgamated the officers’ and under-officers’ colleges. Organisation into Regiments. According to the new system, each regiment will consist of one or more battalions of trained men for duty on the roads and a dep6t battalion for training recruits. Northern Section. The 1st regiment is organised in three battalions. The 1st and 2nd battalions, with head-quarters at Tehran and Kazvin respectively, are allotted to the roads in the vicinity of the capital and to the Tehran-Kazvin-Enzeli and Kazvin-Hamadan roads. The 3rd, or depot battalion, has its head-quarters at Tehran. The 2nd regiment consists of only two battalions, both with their head-quarters at Tehran. The 1st battalion is distributed along the Tehran-Kum-Passangan and Tehran-Veramin roads. The 2nd is the depot battalion. Southern Section. The organisation of the 3rd regiment, which at present numbers about 250 men, and has an under-officers school attached to it, will not be completed till next spring. Colonel Hjalmarson intended to train the whole of the first levde for the Pars gendarmene at Tehran. Last spring, however, before an adequate number of men had been trained, and in spite of his remonstrances, the Central Government directed him to commence work at Shiraz without any further delay. Accordingly, 130 men, mider three Swedish officers, were transferred from Tehran last March to form a nucleus for the Ears gendarmerie. But owing to opposition on the part of the local authorities, recruits were not forthcoming in sufficient numbers. The reverse the hands of Soulet-ed-i)owleh s followers last August has rendered recruiting even more difficult than hitherto; and as there is no likelihood of any improvement in this respect until the gendarmerie is strong enough to command respect locally, the commandant has decided to tram a draft of 925 men at the head-quarters of the 1st and 2nd regiments, and to transfer it to Shiraz next spring. an* r ^^ ie or gT nisation of t]ie r 6gi m ent into battalions, its distribution along the Bushire- Smiaz-Yezdikhast road, and if possible the formation of an officers’ and under-officers’ college, similar to that at Tehran, will then be taken in hand. Ispahan Regiment. Next year, provided funds are forthcoming, the commandant hopes to be able to form a regiment with head-quarters at Ispahan, for the protection of the road from Passangan^to Yezdikhast, thereby linking up the northern and southern sections of the gendarmerie. Estimated Cost. The estimated cost of the maintenance of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd regiments for the twelve months commencing from the 1st October is 6,163,071 krans (112,056k), and for the raising' and upkeep of the Ispahan regiment for a similar period, 4,072 425 krans (74,044k). Recruiting. Colonel Hjalmarson, in his observations on the work of the gendarmerie, draws attention to the difficulties he has had to contend with since his arrival in Tehran, especially as regards recruiting. In the north as well as in the south those in authority have hindered the develop ment of the corps. r The governor of Kazvin, for instance, demanded a bribe of 2,000 tomans from a recruiting party under a Swedish officer sent into his district last spring. As his request was not acceded to, he forbade the tribal chiefs under his jurisdiction to191 * have any dealings with the recruiting officer, and the party failed to obtain any recruits. Later on in the year the officer in charge of the Kazvin command managed to recruit locally some twenty men, hut as soon as the Minister of War heard of this, he issued an order prohibiting recruiting in the district. In the Kum district the local regiment and its recruiting area was placed at the disposal of the gendarmerie by the orders of the Central Government. The com mandant entrusted the work of obtaining men for the gendarmerie to the officers of the regiment; hut these, instead of spending their energies in recruiting, levied black mail on all concerned under threats of enforced service in the gendarmerie. In view of the extra recruiting necessary this autumn, owing to the preparation of the draft for Shiraz, representations have been made to the Minister of the Interior to take steps to suppress these abuses. Courts of Justice. Colonel Hjahnarson also complains that the methods of the Persian courts of justice, to whom the gendarmerie have to hand over offenders for punishment, leave much to be desired. He suggested to the Minister of Justice that Persian officers of the gendarmerie should be empowered to give minor punishments, and that, wherever Swedish officers were stationed, courts should be formed under their presidency for dealing with the more serious offences. The Minister of Justice said he could not sanction the proposed reform, as it would be contrary to the laws of the country. He assured Colonel Hjalmarson, however, that he would appoint suitable men as justices of the peace, especially for dealing with offenders handed over by the gendarmerie. Prospects of ultimate Success. In spite of the opposition of certain Cabinet Ministers and provincial governors, and of the exaggerated stories regarding the harshness of the discipline that have been spread abroad, Colonel Hjalmarson is confident of success. , The clergy, whom he has conciliated in various ways, are so far well disposed towards the gendarmerie, and he is of opinion that so long as the men are paid regular y service in the corps will be popular. ....... , n , He says that his officers have found the men intelligent and willing to learn at first, but that as soon as they enter on the higher forms of training they are liable to become lethargic. He hopes that with patience his officers will be able to overcome this weakness in the Persian character. , . r vi • He does not think that the men are wanting m the necessary military qualities He says that the men under the immediate command of the Swedish officers fought we in the engagement which took place near Shiraz last August, and that those v ho e t the field were under a Persian officer who was wanting in courage, and so unab e his men a good example.

I added that I was quite aware that the receipts of the southern customs ought to be amply sufficient to satisfy the fixed charges on them, but that unfortunately the treasurer-general would persist in diverting this source of revenue to purposes for which it could not properly be used until the calls upon it under the loan contract of 1911 had been satisfied. Such proceedings, I said, did not inspire confidence, and I thought that expert opinion would have to be taken upon the figures supplied in the statement referred to above before the possibility of making such a loan as the one proposed could be established. I then asked Ali Kuli Khan what the proposal for a railway from the north to the south meant, and told him that I had received your instructions to co-operate with my Russian colleague in asking for an option on behalf of the Societe d’Etudes, an Anglo- Franco-Russian syndicate, for the construction of a railway on much the same lines as those indicated. Ali Kuli Khan replied that he believed that the line I mentioned was the scheme alluded to, and that he thought there would be no difficulty in securing the option sought. He added that considerable progress had been made lately with the British and Russian railway schemes that are before the Persian Government, and seemed to anticipate that the questions would be settled satisfactorily very soon. It was clear, I said, that Nos. 6 and 7 did not concern me, but I expressed a hope that he would pardon me for saying that I considered their inclusion in such a paper very bad diplomacy. The Russian Government, if they chose to reply to No. 6, could easily answer in such a manner as would leave the Persian Government without a reply, and no good could be expected from an allusion that could not fail to be irritating. Whatever one might think about the influences that had been connected with the appointment of Shuja-ed-Dowleh, that official had been actually appointed by the Governor-General, who might well be held to blame by the Russian Government if he allowed his subordinate to usurp his functions. As to the question of the Shahsevans, it was folly to talk of the Governor-General settling it, when all the world knows that he has no force at his disposal capable of making any impression upon that turbulent tribe, even if it were likely that the pious wish expressed would turn the Russian Government from their purpose or have any but an irritating effect. The Russian Government considered the predatory habits of the tribe a constant source of danger to the lives and property of the neighbouring inhabitants, and had there fore decided, possibly most reluctantly, to inflict a punishment that the Persian Government were unable to impose under existing circumstances. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 372. Statement by Persian Government. DEPUIS plusieurs annees tons les efforts du Gouvernement Imperial ont tendu vers la realisation des reformes urgentes; neanmoins, le temps et les moyens dont il disposait ayant ete consacres a reprimer des troubles inattendus, il n’a pu completement atteindre le but qu’il se proposait. L’achevement des reformes projetees ne pouvant etre, d’autre part, differe plus longtemps, le Gouvernement Imperial est fermement determine a mettre en execution, dans le plus bref delai possible, le programme qu’il s’est trace. A cet effet, il attire Pattention des deux Puissances voisines sur les points suivants, desireux qu’il est de s’assurer leur concours amical en ce qui les concerne:— 1- Le retablissement de 1’ordre et la securite des routes commerciales font, en premiere ligne, 1’objet de la plus vive sollicitude du Gouvernement, et cela par les moyens suivants :— (a.) Developpement de la gendarmerie avec 1’aide des officiers suedois. (6.) Organisation de la police avec 1’aide des officiers suedois. (c.) Organisation d’une armee de 28,000 hommes, bien armes, dont un premier[131 i94 which will gradually pass all the other army corps quartered in the provinces with the duty of maintaining order there. 2. In order to procure the necessary means for the re-establishment of order, the purchase of sufficient arms, administrative reforms, development of the natural wealth of the country, and, above all, financial reform, the Imperial Government are obliged to have recourse to a large loan on conditions of a purely economic character. They are quite prepared to enter into immediate negotiations with this object. The present revenues of the country, not including the maliat (land tax) and after deducting the sums assigned to the amortisation of the previous loans and those required for obligatory expenditure, are sufficient for the guarantee of a loan of at least 30,000,000 tomans. Pending the issue of this large loan, in order to making a beginning with their programme, the Persian Government apply to the two Powers for a sum of 200,000/. in the form of an advance. 3. The presence of foreign troops in Persian territory being obviously injurious to the prestige of the Central Government, the latter would request the favourable attention of the two Powers to the solution of this difficulty, in order that the govern ment of the country may be carried on with the necessary authority. 4. Seeing that the development of trade and the prosperity of the country are impossible without the construction of railways, the Imperial Government have decided to connect the Caspian Sea, or a point on the frontier of Azerbaijan, with the Persian Gulf by an international railway. 5. The reassembly of Parliament is also one of the objects of the Government. 6. The re-establishment of ord^r in the province of Azerbaijan being especially desired, the Imperial Government request the favourable attention of the Russian Government to the following points, with a view to the realisation of this object and the consequent strengthening of the authority of the Governor-General of that province:—• (a.) That Shuja-ed-Dowleh should refrain from interfering with the Central Government of Azerbaijan; (6.) That the settlement of the trouble with the Shahsevans should be left entirely to the Governor-General. 7. In view of the fact that rumours of the return of the ex-Shah continue from time to time to unsettle men’s minds and encourage the disorderly elements, the Imperial Government repeat their previous request that the two Powers which signed the protocol of 1909 will give them formal assurances with a view to removing all danger of a fresh attempt by the ex-Shah to return to Persia.

I communicated substance to Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs in a private letter yesterday. His Excellency told me to-day that Russian Minister had been authorised to summon troops to Tehran in case of urgent danger, as he alone was in a position to judge whether their presence was necessary or not. I remarked that Russian Minister seemed to take too serious a view of the situation, and expressed earnest hope that such a step would only be taken in very last resort.

I had not been able to ascertain the views of his Highness on the present situation before owing to indisposition and various causes. In his Highness’s opinion, Ain-ed-Dowleh would be the most suitable person to form a new Cabinet. His Highness observed that, so long as the present uncertainty lasted, the Cabinet now in office would refuse to sign concessions. _ . Ain-ed-Dowleh’s appointment would meet with opposition from the Bakhtians, which could doubtless be overcome if it were seen that the two legations were acting m concert. The Russian Minister is a strong supporter of Ain-ed-Dowleh, but the relations between him and His Majesty’s Legation have not been friendly for some years, as you already know. Provided, however, that he is considered the best man to establish some sort of order in Persia, the fact that he has been on bad terms with us should not in my opinion militate against him. No. 376.

Sir IF. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 5.) (Telegraphic.) _ Tehran. November 5, 1912. I HAVE received from the acting British consul at Shiraz a financial programme submitted to him by the Governor-General. The most important point in it is that the Government at Tehran should guarantee the Governor-General a sum of 6,000L a-month to be devoted to the payment of the expenses of his administration. Mukhber proposes that a credit account should be opened by the Imperial Bank on which he can199 freely draw up to 6,000/., and that all the revenues of Ears shall be paid into his account, the Central Government to make good any deficiency. The treasurer-general is, however, unable to give the necessary guarantee, as he has no funds available for the purpose. The manager of the bank, having consulted the branch at Shiraz, is also unable to agree to the proposal. The Governor-General’s mission is doomed to failure unless he can be assured of the necessary money to enable his administration to be properly carried on. If once he succeeded in restoring order in Ears, the sum required could be raised in a few months out of the revenues, which have been estimated to yield, in normal times, some 150,000/. per annum. The treasurer-general is sending a European representative to Shiraz, where he will arrive in about three weeks, to control the revenue and expenditure. This official will, when he has had time to study the question, be able to report what the revenues should amount to now under proper management. Money is urgently required. The future situation depends to a great extent on whether or no it can be procured. I think that if you were able to arrange in some manner to give Mukhber financial assistance through the Imperial Bank for a few months the effect would probably be excellent. No. 392.

It was arranged that we should march slowly to Saman where Sardar-i-Fatheh would bring the replies from Amir Mujahid, and where Sardar-i-Jang had ordered some 200 Bakhtiari sowars to concentrate. On the 24th August Najafabad was reached, and a halt made the following day. On the 26th we reached Azizabad, and there received news that Amir Mujahid with several of the younger khans and a following of some 1,500 Bakhtiaris had moved from his home (Shamsabad) to Deh Kurd north of which village he proposed to forcibly resist our advance. On the 27th we marched to Saman where the 200 sowars, mentioned above, joined our camp, bringing the number of the Sardar’s following to some 500 horse and foot. The same day Sardar-i-Fatheh returned to camp with messages from Amir Mujahid to the effect that he and the junior khans had do intention of resisting the Sardar by force, and that, provided the latter was willing to support them in their just demands with the other senior khans, they were prepared to aid him by every means in their power. On the 28th we moved to Deh Kurd where several interviews took place with the Amir Mujahid and the younger khans. The Sarda.r-i-Jang promised to support the Amir in his desire to obtain a governorship, but we decided that we would try and induce him to accept the Behbehan governorship for which he was peculiarly fitted owing to his relationship with the Bahmai Kuhgelus, and his intimate knowledge of Kuhgelu politics. The Sardar promised also to use his influence in favour of the junior khans and in return obtained their undertaking to support him. On the 30th August the camp was broken up, all the khans proceeding to their homes, while tents, provisions, &amp;c., were collected at Chighakhur. On the 4th September we all concentrated again at Chighakhur, and here we were successful in persuading Amir Mujahid to accept the Behbehan governorship. It was arranged that he should go to his home to make the necessary preparations for his journey, return to Chighakhur about the end of September, and then leave direct for his new capital. On the 15th September the khans in Tehran notified both the Sardar-i-Jang and Amir Mujahid that the latter had been appointed to the governorship of Yezd. They had arranged this appointment on the recommendation of Sardar-i-Jang at the time when we had considered it advisable to get the Amir out of Bakhtiari territory as soon as possible, and before we had succeeded in inducing him to accept the Behbehan governorship. On the receipt of the news the Amir was immediately summoned to Chighakhur where it was explained to him that his appointment to Yezd was made under a misapprehension, and that he must proceed, as arranged, to Behbehan. It was agreed that he should send Muntazzim-ed-Dowleh to represent him in Yezd, and meanwhile go to Behbehan, take the necessary hostages from the Kuhgelu tribes to guarantee their good behaviour, and then, if all promised well, be relieved by one of the junior khans, and proceed to Yezd. The Amir agreed to these arrangements. The arrangements made to ensure the safety of the Lynch road were as follows : 200 men have been selected from the Zarraswand and Usiwand sections as road guards. These sections are the best armed of all the Bakhtiaris, 80 per cent, of them possessing magazine rifles. These guards have been paid a cash advance of 120 krans each, the money being paid to them before me, and they have been promised regular pay at the rate of 120 krans per month as long as their services may be required. The command of these guards has been given to Bahadur-es-Sultaneh, the son of Hujabr-es-Sultan, the senior khan of the Haji Ilkhani family. Ample funds have been placed at the disposal of this young chief. In addition to the command of the road guards he has been given certain powers over the Dinaruni (Aurak) section, which occupies the territory adjoining the road, and 300 men from this section have been ordered to remain in the vicinity of the road itself, and made responsible for the safety of traffic. Bahadur-es-Sultaneh with his guards left Chighakhur for the road on the 16th September. On the 18th September the ilkhani announced to me officially the opening of the road, and I notified Ispahan and Ahwaz, It is hoped that it will be possible to considerably reduce the number of the road guards once the Amir Mujahid has assumed control at Behbehan, and has got the Kuhgelu well in hand. ^ Sufficient men to garrison the six newly constructed towers201 with a few men at each of the six or seven more remote halting places would probably then be sufficient to prevent any Bakhtiari interference with traffic. The Sardar-i-Jang has promised that the question of providing and improving accommodation at the various stages, making arrangements for fodder and effecting necessary repairs to the track itself will receive his attention as money becomes available from bridge tolls, tribal revenue, &amp;c. The arrangements made, in my opinion, promise well, and Sardar-i-Jang is to be congratulated on the great deal he has accomplished in so short a time. Murteza Kulli Khan, once having decided to accept the ilbegiship, has rendered the Sardar his loyal support and assistance, which was particularly valuable when the resistance of the young khans had to be overcome. The tribal administration of the Sardar is capable and disinterested, and he is rapidly gaining the confidence and affection of the tribesmen. In view of the excellent work so far done by the Sardar, and his undoubtedly sincere desire to see order restored and kept in Bakhtiari territory, I venture to point out to your Excellency the importance of rendering him our utmost support, and of ensuring that the ample powers he now enjoys under his “ sanad ” are not modified during the full term of his appointment.

I have acknowledged receipt of the telegiam, an informed the signatories that I am communicating its contents to you. My Russian colleague, who has received a similar telegram, has, I understand, returned a like That the telegram and the closing of the bazaars, which occurred simultaneously with its dispatch, were inspired by Shuja-ed-Dowleh I have not the slightest dou . If proof were neided, it would be furnished by the fact that he knew of the telegram some time before it arrived at Tabriz. Moreover, the Governor of Zenjan Muayid-ed- Dowleh is a brother and confederate of Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and apparent y almost as forceful a personality.

In this connection it must be borne in mind that Mohammed Ali, while he was Crown Prince in Azerbaijan, had the reputation of being a strong, if somewhat oppressive, governor, and that he kept good order. On the other hand, among the official, professional, and leisured classes, there are undoubtedly many ardent speculative Nationalists, but it is questionable if any of these would run the risk of airing their opinions if the ex-Shah were to put in an appearance. Their politics are confined to theory, and I do not believe that there is a man among them capable of leading a constitutional movement at the present time. Moreover, they are cowed by the presence in the town of Shuja-ed-Dowleh and his men. I have, &amp;c. N. PATRICK COWAN. Enclosure 2 in No. 394.

YOUR Excellency is aware that in the past few years, although a number of intriguers apparently asked for a constitution their sole object was to cause sedition, the consequences of which have upset the country and brought about great bloodshed. Nothing is left for the inhabitants, and their patience can endure no longer. It is evident that a country without a King is like a body without life, and so the only comfort for the general population of Persia is to bring back the Shah. We, the clerics, merchants, officials, and inhabitants (of Zenjan) from the first understood the case and never wished to depose our Sovereign, and we expressed our opinion to this effect, and waited till it should become clear to everybody. At present there is no remedy for the benefit of the country except to bring back the Shah, “ a kind father for all Persians,” to his ancestral Throne. We are but human beings, and do not expect that the great Powers should tolerate more suffering and humiliation on our account, and we hope that His Imperial Majesty will in a neighbourly way help our Sovereign Mohammed Ali Shah in person and direct his kind attention to relieve our distress.

Farman Farma with the small force at his disposal may take “bast,” but if the town is attacked and he resists, it will again be pillaged. He has repeatedly spoken to me and to my Russian colleague of the necessity of Government supplying him with funds to raise a local force, saying that local levieswill fight for him if paid regularly. It is certain that unless well paid the tribes would not fight for him, and it is doubtful if they would in any case as long as he has no outside forces, such as Bakhtiari. The 150 Cossacks he has are not reliable ; his defeat near Hamadan, it appears, was due to their cowardice or worse. Salar-ed-Dowleh always asserted that the Cossacks would not fight against him. On the 2Cth, as reported by telegraph, the townspeople crowded to the British and Russian consulates and presented a petition, which is enclosed, with translation. Ulemas, princes, traders, and mechanics are all represented. There is no doubt that this action was originally instigated by Farman Farina, but was only taken after many meetings and all swearing to act together. The people undoubtedly have cause to complain. There are a certain number who are partisans of Salar-ed-Dowleh and the Government respectively, but the majority only ask for security to carry on their occupa tions. The town was looted by Salar-ed-Dowleh’s savages in February, and the villages have been looted by both parties. Heavy sums were exacted by Salar and smaller sums by Farman Farma. The people say that their property has gone, and that there is no security to try and recover what is left, or cultivate their lands. Only honour remains, and their wives and families are in danger if either side storm the town. They are prepared to submit to whoever has Tehran, but meantime ask to be allowed to be neutral. Farman Farma has orders to hold the town. I believe, till the army arrives, that he has only enough men to hold the citadel. I conveyed to Samsam-el-Mamalek Sanjabi that now was the time to show his loyalty, as the Government has the support of the two Powers. He has come in with his sons and sowars, Sanjabi and Guran. If he is satisfied that the townspeople will not attack him in the rear, I believe he may be able to save the situation, but their faith is doubtful. This morning a deputation waited on me, begging that the consuls would send to the Salar asking him not to fight in the town. They also asked for protection for their families. After consulting my Russian colleague, we replied that we could only protect those in “ bast ” in the consulates, but not their families and property in town. We have written to Farman Farma and to Salar, or commander of his forces, that if they fight in town they will be responsible for all damage to foreign property. September 29.—Farman Farma has replied that the army leaves Assadabad to-day for Kermanshah, and that on his return he will order them to go out to attack the rebels and do what is possible to avoid fighting in town, but that, if unexpectedly attacked, he must defend the citadel.

I HAVE the honour to report that the rebels under Yar Mohammed Khan Mujahed attacked the town at 2*30 a.m. on the 5th October. Farraan Farma held the Govern ment buildings and the Bakhtiari and Sinjabi held Chia Surkh, a hill suburb inhabited by Kurds, with two guns. About 9 a.m. Yar Mohammed, who had advanced to near the square in front of the Government buildings, fell dead, shot through the head. The Kalhurs, of whom there were about fifty with him, at once fled and rode into the consulate asking for asylum. I told them that I could give them no promise of safety, and they left, with the exception of three wounded and five mujahed. The latter only asked to be given to their own officers. Among them was the democrat agent, Kerim Aga; he said he had nothing to do with the fighting, but was with them to try and make peace. I allowed him to remain on the understanding that if he were proved to have taken part in the fighting I could do nothing for him. The rebels gradually fled, but there was firing at intervals until late in the afternoon. About noon, about 200 Kurds, chiefly of Juanrud, came into the consulate grounds, and the Government troops fired at them with rifle and Maxim, many shots striking the escort quarters, which are 200 yards from the house. I knew nothing of this, it not being safe to go to the escort quarters, till my munshi arrived with a message from the Farman Farma that a number of rebels were in my grounds, and that he would guarantee the safety of their lives if I disarmed them. I went down and admitted them to the stables, where they surrendered their arms. Some had only clubs. They are to be sent with an escort by Farman Farma in the direction of their own country. They ask to be seen safe past the Sanjabi country. This is now being arranged by the karguzar, and I expect them to leave this evening. The wounded, of whom there are a dozen, will be taken to the Farman Farina’s hospital. I am also in communication with the mujaheds and Bakhtiari ; as to the mujaheds, it seems to be accepted that most of them would have deserted Yar Mohammed had they had a chance. Hussein Kuli Khan, Yar Mohammed’s second in command, appears to have got away with his men. It is said that about 200 out of 700 Kurdistanis were killed. After the dead are buried, a proper estimate may be available. After the defeat of the rebels a party of Kalhurs were advancing from Mahidasht to join them, and were met and driven back by the Bakhtiari. It is generally believed that the death of Yar Mohammed is the final blow to Salar- ed-Dowleh’s rebellion. I have, &amp;c. w. McDouall.I 205 No. 396. Sir, Sit W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 7.) Tehran, October 20, 1912. WITH reference to my despatch of the 24th ultimo, I have the honour to forward to you herewith translation of the reply which I have received from the Persian Government to my note of the 20th September, enumerating the measures taken by them to obtain reparation for the attacks on the consular escort in December last, and giving assurances respecting the arrangements for the comfort of His Majesty’s troops at Shiraz. (Translation.) Your Excellency, October 17, 1912. I HAVE communicated to the Imperial Persian Government the contents of your Excellency’s note of the 20th September last, and I have the honour to inform your Excellency of the pleasure with which it was received, and of the confidence the Persian Government have always had in the friendship and good-will of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. I have, at the same time, to point out to your Excellency that the Persian Government have considered worthy of deep consideration the contents of Sir George Barclay’s note of the 4th April last, and that the adequate measures taken by them have met with success, to wit, the dispatch of a conciliatory telegram by the great Ulema, the prevention of agitation by certain people, the sending of the Governor- General to Ears, and the affording him the necessary support. The only question that now remains unsettled is that of the perpetrators of the regrettable incident of the attack on Mr. Smart. In spite of the verbal assurances given by Sir George Barclay that after the acceptance by the Persian Government of the demand for the payment of 4,744L the question would not be pursued* the Persian Government have decided that the offenders should be punished, and they have given special instructions to the Governor-General of Ears in the matter, and they hope that aftei the arrival of ns Excellency at Shiraz, and after the preliminary measures which are essential, he will succeed in his task. _ ,. With regard to the consular guards at Shiraz, and the detachment proceeding thither from Ispahan, the Governor-General has been requested to assist m the matter, and to make arrangements for their comfort.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.-— (Received November 7.) Tehran, October 23, 1912. AS vou have been made aware in previous telegrams and despatches, * See Sir W. Townley’s observations on this point in his despatch of July 10, 1912 (No. 229).206 Tehran the chance of capturing Salar had been missed, and the Prince was already beyond their reach. The fugitive apparently first fled towards Kurdistan as far as Guerous, where all trace of him was lost. Suddenly it was rumoured that he was at Sirab on the road between Hamadan and Kazvin, and conjecture was rife as to his intentions. Many people believed that he was seeking “ bast ” at the Russian consulate at Kazvin ; others had it that he was about to attack that town at the head of a considerable force. An unconfirmed rumour then reported him on the Zenjan road, but his movements were shrouded in mystery until it was suddenly announced that he had been seen at Hessarek, about 35 miles from Tehran, on the night of the 16th instant. Preparations were at once hastily made to defend the town against a hostile attack, as no one had any definite information as to the strength of his following. Permission was given to the Russian officers attached to the Cossack brigade to assist in the defence of the town, for which object they co-operated with the gendarmes under Swedish officers and with the Bakhtiari horsemen. No definite information could be obtained either of the Prince’s whereabouts or of the number of his men for three days, until the news was sent in by a party of Bakhtiari on their way to Kazvin that he was in full retreat towards the mountains in the direction of Mazanderan, and that his force did not number more than 280 men in all. At once hasty preparations were made to send a mixed force of cavalry in pursuit, but so far nothing has been done, and the latest news is to the effect that he has passed into the mountains to the north-east of the town, and that he has a following of a thousand, a figure that is clearly an exaggeration. Nobody appears to know what his object was in coming so near to Tehran, nor are his plans for the future understood. It would appear to be generally believed that he will make for Asterabad and the Turkoman country. Salar-ed-T)owleh’s near approach to the capital and the inexplicable apathy of the Government provoked much comment, and there was a certain amount of public anxiety, as people argued that he would never have approached so near, had he not felt confident that there would be a movement in the town in his favour. The democrats and mujabeds were the parties suspected of being in sympathy with him. The Government were a little anxious for a day or two, as they are well aware of their own unpopularity, and feared lest the malcontents might seize the opportunity to make mischief. I have caused careful enquiry to be made, and have come to the conclusion that there is no party in the town in favour of Safaris pretensions. My Russian colleague judged the situation sufficiently serious when the news of Salar’s near approach was first known to justify him in instructing the general at Kazvin to hold himself in readiness to march on Tehran, should disorders break out. In answering M. Poklewsky’s letter in which he informed me that he had taken this step, I expressed my concurrence in his action as a precautionary measure, but I added that I did not personally anticipate any disorders, since I had been unable to discover that the Prince had any serious number of sympathisers in the town. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. * I No. 398. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 7, 1912. SIR W. TOWNLEY’S telegram of 5th November.

Please ask M. Sazonof whether the Russian Government would be prepared to guarantee one-half of this sum. If so, His Majesty’s Government will consider guaranteeing the other half, subject to such conditions as may appear expedient. Perhaps the best course would be for financiers to lend money on the security of the Persian Crown jewels, as it is required. In this event the guarantee of the two Governments would, in practice, only entail the liability to secure that these jewels were available in case of default. » No. 408. Sir G.

M. rUJlLiiiWbKY and 1 had an interview yesterday with Saad-ed-Dowleh, who gave us the names of certain men who, if they could be persuaded to accept office, would, in his opinion, form a strong and representative Ministry under him. baad-ed-Dowleh is apparently in favour of summoning a Medjliss in due course. He pioposes to institute a Conseil d Etat, which would consist of about thirty members, and would represent the Government half of the Senate which he proposes to create when the Medjliss is convoked. The present Prime Minister, accompanied by the Minister of War, came to see me, as representing the whole Bakhtiari tribe, to discuss the situation. They gave me to understand that, provided assurances were given that hostility would not be shown to their tribe nor the Bakhtiari governors dismissed, the Prime Minister would be prepared to resign on receipt of a friendly intimation from M. Poklewsky and myself that a At my interview with Saad-ed-Dowleh, reported in my preceding telegram of to-day, he called my attention to the necessity of Persia being supplied with funds. As regards the 150,000L which he understood was to be advanced as soon as the concession of raising a loan, but if the British and Russian Governments could not make a substantial advance on such a loan without delay his own task would be hopeless. We suggested to Saad-ed-Dowleh that he should obtain from M. Mornard, and communicate to us, a statement indicating what amount was immediately required by the administration ; we would then refer the question to our respective Governments. I took the opportunity to impress on Saad-ed-Dowleh, with the loyal support of the Russian Minister, that His Majesty’s Government expected the Persian Government to grant the concession for the railway between Mohammerah and Khoremabad at the same time as that for the Julfa Railway, pointing out that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs had given me repeated assurances that this would be done.

Summary of Events for the Month of October. Tehran. THE Otthmet.—Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s Cabinet continues to carry on the Govern ment, but it is well known that a change is imminent, as Saad-ed-Dowleh has been211 invited by the Pieiniei to come to Tehran. The Premier telegraphed to Saad-ed- Dowleh on the ^Oth October and received his reply on the 22nd. Salar-ed-Dowleh.-~As reported fnlly in a separate despatch, Salar-ed-Dowleh came to within 30 miles of Tehran with a small force on the 18th October. For a day or two it w r as thought he intended to attack the city, and preparations for defence were hastily made. Salar-ed-Dowdeh, however, made his w r ay to Shahristanek, in the mountains north of Tehran, and remained there on the 22nd and 23rd October. He then proceeded in a northerly direction towards Mazandaran. No serious attempt was made by the Government to pursue him till the 27th and 28th October, when a small force composed of about 300 Bakhtiaris, 100 Ossanlou horsemen, and 50 Cossacks, with two mountain guns, were dispatched against him. A certain Hayder Kuli Khan took refuge at the legation on the 25th October, and it is thought that he was one of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s followers, though he himself denies it. Political Prisoners. —The political prisoners mentioned in the May summary wmre brought back to Tehran from Kum on the 19th October, and are now in custody at Bagh-i-Shah. They include Sardar Mohy, his brothers, and Suleiman Mirza, the leader of the Democratic party. Elections for the Medjliss. —-The committee referred to in the September summary subsequent^ declared that, in their opinion, the question of considering whether it would be desirable to modify the electoral law should be referred to a more repre sentative body. A larger committee was thereupon formed, consisting of about fifty- four members of all classes elected by the people themselves. Sardar Assad w r as elected to the chair, and several meetings were held in October. By a vote of the majority it was decided that the electoral law passed by the last Medjliss could not, under present circumstances, be carried out. A sub-committee was then formed to elaborate a new electoral law, and is now occupied in drawing it up. Tabriz. As the operations against the Shahsevans are, for the time being, in abeyance, the Russians have withdrawn a large portion of their field force from the Ardebil district. Some of the troops have returned to Russia, and some have been transferred to the Urmia district. Meshed. With the exception of the road from Meshed to Askabad, which is guarded by Russian posts, practically all the roads in Khorassan have been closed to traffic throughout the past month. The Turkomans, reported in last month’s summary as raiding in the neighbourhood of Shahrud, have lately been joined by other parties of the tribe, and their number is now estimated at about 1,000. The road to Tehran is closed, and posts are being forwarded via Russia. . Ispahan. There has been some slight improvement of late in the condition of the main roads in the province, but several parties of robbers are reported in the outlying districts The town has, as a rule, remained quiet, but there has been occasional filing at night time. On the night of the 6th—7th October, sharp firing broke out in various quarters of the town owing to the presence of an armed paity of buiglais, and, as some shots passed close to the British hospital, His Majesty s consul-general w as compelled to address a warning to the local authorities. u A ” squadron of the Central India Horse left for Shiraz on the oth October. Yezd. Assadullah Mirza, the late governor, left Yezd for Tehran on the 9th October after handing over charge to the deputy governor. Naib Hussein and his son Mashallah, however, who, with a following of 1)00 sowars, had arrived at^lez on tie 4th October, took over the governorship of the town on Assadiillah Mirza s departure, and directed their followers at Kum and at Kashan to join them at Yezd, with the avowed intention of resisting the new governor by force. . On the 25th on the receipt of a telegram from lehran announcing the appoint ment of Sardar-i-Fatteh, Bakhtiari, as governor, Mashallah refused to recognise the . [1340] 2 A 3212 authority of the Central Government, and commenced making preparations to oppose Sardar-i-Fatteh on his arrival. He liberated and armed the prisoners in the jails, summoned into the town several bad characters from the^ neighbouring villages, and gave out his intention of looting the Imperial Bank, the British vice-consulate, and the Russian consular agency. The town was completely at his mercy, and several merchants and others took refuge in the vice-consnlate. However, on pressure being brought to bear by various authorities, he became more reasonable, and left Yezd on the 29th October. ^ Sardar-i-Fatteh left Ispahan for Yezd on the 25th October with a force of 200 sowars and two guns. Mr. Lemon, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was robbed by a party of Boir Ahmedis, on the road near Nain, on the 27th October. The tofangchis, acting as his escort, made no attempt at resistance when attacked. Shiraz. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor-General of Fars, arrived at Shiraz on the 16th October. There have been dissensions among the Kashgais for some time past, and Soulet-es-Sultaneh, with the assistance of Soulet-ed-Dowleh and of some of the smaller tribes, has brought about the resignation of Sardar Ehtesham, the former ilkhani of the tribe. A party, consisting of a few Europeans and some invalided followers of the Central India Horse, left Shiraz for Bushire on the 24th October under a guarantee for its safe conduct given by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. Kerman. Amir-i-Mufakham, the new Governor-General of the province, arrived at Kerman on the 30th September. Since his arrival the town and environs have remained quiet, and the road to Yezd, along which Bakhtiari guards have been posted, has been opened to traffic. Kermanshah. Salar-ed-Dowleh and Yar Mohammed, with a force of about 1,000 men, reached Mian Darband, 35 miles from Kermanshah, on the 3rd October, and, in response to a joint communication from the British and Russian consuls requesting that fighting should not take place in the town, agreed to halt for two days so as to enable Farman Farma to move out of Kermanshah and advance against them. Farman Farma gave orders for his troops to leave on the morning of the 6th ; but at 2 o’clock in the morning of the 5th October Yar Mohammed with 400 followers commenced an attack on the town. By 10 a.m. he had penetrated some way into the bazaars, when a sortie was made by a party of Government troops from the Ark. In the fighting which ensued Y'ar Mohammed was killed, and his followers, apparently losing heart, broke and fled, pursued by the Bakhtiari and mujahedin. In the engagement the rebels lost some twenty-five men killed and wounded and eighty prisoners. Salar-ed-Dowleh, who took no active part in the fighting, managed to evade the Government troops, and left the Kermanshah district with some 250 followers. His further movements are reported in this summary under the heading “ Tehran.” No. 415. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 18.) Sir, Tehran, October 29, 1912.

They eventually decided to appoint a Bakhtiari, Sardar-i- Fatteh, temporarily, pending the arrival of another Bakhtiari, Amir Mujahed, who is now acting as Governor of Behbehan, where his presence is required. In the meantime, however, the notorious ex-outlaw, Naib Hussein, proceeded to Yezd with his son, Mashallah, and some 500 sowars. All the power apparently fell into their hands, and they prepared to resist any governor who might be appointed ; they levied revenue and proceeded to repair the forts.213 Matters came to a head about the 24th instant, on the receipt of the news of the appointment of feardar-i-4 atteh. Mashallah released the contents of the prisons, who marched about the town fully armed, terrorising the Parsees and the townspeople. He was also reported to have threatened to murder the British vice-consul, the Russian agent, and the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and to loot all the European establishments, his object partly being, it was alleged, to embroil the Persian Govern ment with foreign Governments. The whole town seems to have been in a complete turmoil, and a large crowd of merchants and others, under the leadership of the principal priests, moved about seeking sanctuary at the British vice-consulate and the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s station. Suggestions were put forward from all sides that the Persian Government should be approached with a view to recognising Mashallah as governor, thereby saving the town from the horrors anticipated from a refusal to do so. It appeared to me, however, after careful deliberation, that Mashallah was playing a bold game, and that he had been scattering his wild threats broadcast with a view to obtaining official support for his demand to be appointed governor. While fully realising the gravity of the situation, of which I kept the Persian Government informed, I could not see my way to advancing the candidature of a rebel outlaw to the governor ship of a province without bringing discredit on His Majesty’s Government. After consulting with my Russian colleague, I therefore instructed the British vice-consul to see Mashallah, in the absence of any constituted authorit}', and to inform him that, as he had taken forcible possession of Yezcf, the Russian Minister and myself would hold him personally responsible for the lives and property of foreigners in Yezd, pending the arrival of the new governor. I added that Mr. Blackman should invite the Russian agent to accompany him. These representations appear to have achieved their object, for, as I had the honour to inform you in my telegram of the 28th October, Mashallah became reasonable and decided to quit Yezd, telegraphing at the same time some excuses to the Minister of the Interior for his behaviour. Sardar-i-Fatteh, the Bakhtiari governor, left his camp at Ispahan on the 26th October for his post, accompanied by 200 sowars, two guns, and ten gunners. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 416. Sir, Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.— (Received November 18.) Tehran, October 29, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a telegram which I have received from the acting British consul at Shiraz, reporting upon a piogiamme concerning the financial arrangements which the Governor-General considers necessary in order that he may be able to carry out the administration o tie province m a wTscussed the contents of Mr. Smart’s telegram with the treasurer-general, who professed his readiness to meet Mukhber-es-Sultaneh s wishes as far as it may be possible for him to do so. M. Mornard stated that he is quite ready to fall m with the views contained in the first clause, provided that he is advised of the steps that have been taken. He took the occasion to inform me that he had recently strengthened the staff of his representative at Shiraz by the dispatch of a competent Persian from here, and that he intends to send M. Stas from Kerman to Shiraz as his European agent at an eariy dafe ^ ^ Momard said that he would do his best to meet Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s wants, but he called attention to the and pointed out that 30,000 tomans (6,0001.) seems to be a sort f Ifb tLYwith monthly requirements of provincial governors. e leasurer g , the best will in the world the Central Government could not ^ ® s tn Oi P P ltnnerial administrations, that ought in normal times to remit considerable ‘“A® '1 Treasury instead of being a charge on the national resources. He prom sed all he same to endeavour to make an arrangement with the Imperial Bank P 8 8.^ revenues of Shiraz as security, and arranging la a :1, should be paid into the bank at Shiraz.^ &lt; . A r i i- t pnr-nnrno-p M. Mornard pointed out that, in his opinion, it was doubtful policy to e , g r n * 1 2 A 4 [1340]provincial governors in a belief that they could count upon the Central Government to make good any shortage on their monthly budgets. Such a knowledge, he thought, encouraged the governors to show leniency to recalcitrant tribes in the matter of collecting revenue from them rather than risk a conflict, thus securing for themselves at the expense of the Government the reputation of having maintained order in the province under their jurisdiction. He thought that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh probably knew at present very little about the possibilities of the province for revenue purposes, and said that he himself would not be in possession of any reliable information upon this point until his European agent, named above, had arrived and had had time to examine the situation closely. I called M. Mornard’s special attention to the third clause of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s desiderata, and reminded him that His Majesty^s Government, as he is well aware, attach great importance to the successful development of the gendarmerie scheme, more especially in so far as the southern trade routes are concerned. Whilst on this subject I would beg, Sir, to recall to your recollection my telegram of the 22nd instant, in which I reported that 1 had learned from Mr. Smart that Mukhber-es- Sultaneh had dispatched a force of gendarmes and local tofangchis to take possession of the road from Zergan to Kazerun, that is to say, from two stages north of Shiraz to the latter place. I have ascertained from Colonel Hjaim arson that he only sanctioned this expedition after he had ascertained from the officer in command of the detachment at Shiraz that the Governor-General had received such assurances from the tribal chiefs located on this portion of the road as justified him in entertaining the belief that a start could be made without undue risk. The colonel added that he had ordered one Swedish officer to accompany the Zergan force and two to proceed to Kazerun, leaving only Major Siefvert in charge at Shiraz, that officer being detained there because he has not yet recovered from the wound received during the unfortunate encounter with Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s men on the 5th August last. It is almost impossible to be sanguine about the result of what appears at first sight to be a daring move on the part of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, but his Excellency impressed me as such a cautious man that I cannot help entertaining some hope that he has good ground for placing confidence in the assurances given him by men who would appear from recent correspondence to have been in no small measure responsible for the disturbances that have caused so much trouble in the immediate past. You will notice, Sir, from Mr. Smart’s accompanying telegram that he also has some misgivings, as is not unnatural, as to the ultimate success of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s plans. It is, I think, of good augury that his Excellency has, after his arrival at Shiraz, expressed a desire that Kawam-ul-Mulk will remain there, as he is hopeful that his presence and advice may be helpful to him. He has also invited Soulet-ed- Dowleh to Shiraz, and proposes to postpone the appointment of a new ilkhani to succeed Sardar Ehtesham, who has resigned, until after the winter, when he will have had more time to consider the claims of the rival candidates, in the hope of making a selection that will please all parties. It will be seen, Sir, that Mr. Smart considers that Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has a difficult task, and that our strong support would appear to be his only chance of success. Financial assistance seems to be clearly indicated as expected, if not anticipated. On this point I failed to get any definite pronouncement from Mukhber- es-Sultaneh himself before he left Tehran, but I discussed the question with the treasurer-general yesterday in order, if possible, to ascertain how this could best be done without wounding the very sensitive susceptibilities of the Persian Government. M. Mornard was of opinion that some such scheme as that suggested earlier in this despatch with the Imperial Bank would be the best course to adopt, and, if the idea commended itself to His Majesty’s Government, some arrangement could, perhaps, be come to with the directors in London by which Mukhber could be financed and the revenues of Shiraz given as a security. It should, I think, nominally at all events be done through the auspices of the treasurer-general, whose agent, who wall be a Belgian, should have a controlling voice in the expenditure. If the Governor-General is successful, the revenues that it will be found possible to collect should more than suffice to meet the requirements of the administration, and in a year, or possibly a few months, his Excellency should be able to find without difficulty sufficient revenue for the wants of the province. Mr. Smart does not mention that there is immediate want of money, but it is more than probable that the Governor-General will be asking for funds eery soon and there will be no money available in the Treasury unless the recent advance of 25,000L is increased to one of 100,000L The Persian Government anticipate that this215 I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 416. Acting Consul Smavt to Siv W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, October 27, 1912. THE Governoi-General s plan for holding the road from Zergan to Kazerun with^ gendarmes and local riflemen under the gendarmerie has been explained to the Persian Government by his Excellency by telegraph. He has also telegraphed explaining his plan for preparing a regular army for the radical treatment in the spring of the tribal and road situations; the army is to consist of about 1,800 men.' He considers the following conditions essential for the successful execution of his plans :— 1. Treasurer-general’s agent at Shiraz to be authorised to settle, with the approval of the Governor-General and without reference to Tehran, the questions of the maliat of the past years and present year as regards remissions for tribal appropriations and on other grounds of equity and expediency. The Governor-General makes a point of there being no reference to Tehran, as such reference causes delays and even evokes vetos from the Tehran authorities, who do not properly understand the local situation, the result being that it is often impossible to collect even the little maliat available. 2. Credit to be opened at the Imperial Bank of Persia of 30,000 tomans (6,0000, about) a-month. The Governor-General to be allowed to draw freely on this credit, presenting detailed account of expenditure drafts to treasurer-general’s agent at Shiraz. All the maliat collected to be paid into the Imperial Bank of Persia for repayment of such drafts, the Persian Government making up shortages. The The acceptance of the first demand might, it is true, lead to irregularity, but I venture to support it and also the third demand as such irregularity would be of little importance to the Treasury, which has long received no money from the Government of Ears. As regards the second demand, I am afraid that much of the money would be wasted unless there were some European control. It is not unlikely that the Governor- General will fail in his mission even if supplied with money. His Excellency evidently expects us to lend the money required. As regards the monthly shortage, I cannot say how large it is likely to be or when it might disappear. The Governor-General’s only chance seems to lie in our strong support, and it must be owned his task seems almost hopeless in any case. His Excellency urges the importance of prompt arrangement in order that there may be no delay in beginning to carry out his plans. I venture to recommend the second demand to your favourable consideration, with its implication that we should lend the money required, but I think it necessary at the same time to draw attention to the attendant disadvantages indicated above. WITH, reference to my despatch of the 25th September, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch from the acting British consul at Shiraz, transmitting copy of correspondence exchanged between himself and the rebel, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, the result of which was that about one-half of the effects plundered from a caravan for the Central India Horse was recovered.

No force was sent against him until lie himself took the initiative in hostilities. It is not clear whether Ins remarks regarding the evils of bringing tribesmen into town refer to his friend Nizam-es-bultaneh or to AFTER Kawam-ul-Mulk had incited to seizure of all my property m the highlands, X, in order not to give him an opening for his evil intentions, refrained fiom taking back my lands and passed my time in retirement. Kawam-ul-Mulk, seeing me quiet, did not content himself with plundering _ my possessions. Some time ago he sent a large force to plunder and kill those tribesmen who had not left me and had not gone to the highlands. Since God protects the innocent, this force was defeated and fled. And as has been seen, he sent rascals among his dependents, Arabs, robbers, band by band, to plunder the unfortunate people everywhere. Therefore, by means of this letter, I inform the consulate that, with this state of affairs, in order to put a stop to the prejudicial measures of Kawam-ul-Mulk, and in order to maintain security and protect merchants and caravans, I am ready to take steps that, in every way, merchants and the unfortunate people may gain tranquillity. Of course, you will send a C0 Py this statement to the centre in order that, if you wish it, action may be taken according to the conditions and method exposed in this statement. Please give me always good news of your health, &amp;c. IT is the duty of every Persian generally, and of this servant of the Government and people especially, to bring this point to the notice of the officials of the British Government, who profess friendship and concord for Persia, and especially to you, who have been presented to the Persian Government as representative for bars and the South [sic]. If the intention of His Majesty the Emperor and his officials is to make this free tract of Southern Persia part of the British possessions, there is no better method than the present one, namely, that they should decide to help a traitor and drive away and weaken a servant of the two Governments (British and Persian). If their object is other than this, and if they wish their merchandise to be conveyed in safety, this method is not a good one. PTe chief object of the civilised world is the increase of commerce. Therefore, it would seem contrary to the dictates of experience, nature, and intelligence to destroy at the instigation of ignorant traitors and false friends, a person who has given proof of complete friendship and service, a person from whom they ought to demand every kind of service, whom they ought to support strongly, and to support a man who cannot protect foreign and native merchandise, nay, cannot even protect himself.

Did not the muleteers arrive at the appointed time ? In spite of all this my services were not recognised, and they treated me haishly. As far as possible 1 restrained the Kashgais and other tribes. What then has happened that they should endeavour to weaken this power (he., myself) ? It is natural that when wild tribes see no restraining power before them, and see that the Governor for the time being helps them and brings them into town and instigates disorders in^ Shiraz, the plundering of merchandise in the bazaars and the pillaging in the environs, the country-side becomes disturbed, and the hire of 17 tomans per 100 mans reaches 50 tomans per 100 mans, and the roads are closed. Useless support of traitors to the two Governments will have the above results. Besides giving up my tribe, who are like my children, and like the shirt next to my body, I passed my time in the lowlands. My lands and dependents in the highlands were plundered. Still they did not leave me quiet here, but sent a force against my tribesmen in Siakh. My men dispersed this force, and then were watching Siakh. The gendarmerie were sent against them. My men were compelled to defend them selves, and they repulsed the gendarmerie. They did not understand who were their opponents, but when they recognised who they were they welcomed them with kindness. W 7 hy should forces be continually sent against neutral tribes in the lowlands ? Apparently the traitors, on account of this, want the Government to incur heavy expenditure. After getting money this time they will ask for it again. They have made this an excuse for getting money. Their object is not service. Their object is that which has been said. Now it is quite easy to rectify all the political errors made on the condition of support (with me). I am ready to do all that is humanly possible for service and maintenance of order, and to repair the past and to bring about your tranquillity, and this without need of giving money to traitors to the two Governments. 1 await an answer. Enclosure 4 in No. 417. Acting Consul Smart to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. (After compliments.) September 3, 1912. I RECEIVED your two letters, and took note of their contents. You yourself write that I “ have been presented to the Persian Government as representative ’ of these parts, and these words alone will suffice to supply my answer.

I am sure you know enough of international relations for this answer to suffice you. But with regard to wdiat you write about the protection of merchandise, of course, you have heard that the Surkhis, who form part of Hassan Ivhan’s force in Siakh, have plundered a caravan of thirty-six loads for the consulate. If you are capable to the degree you claim of protecting foreign and native merchandise, you will recover and restore these goods. I have sent a detailed list of the stolen articles to Hassan Khan in order that you may t a he whatever measures you may think suitable for their recovery.

Should he refuse, he thinks that present Prime Minister might perhaps appoint Saad-ed-Dowleh to be his successor. Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that he had sent a high official to Odessa as ex-Shah had announced his intention of going abroad for two months. His Excellency is anxious that ex-Shah should remain where he is, as there is less risk of his repeating what he did last year. His Majesty will be informed that it is useless for him to think of re-establishing himself on the throne unless he is assured beforehand of the support of His Majesty’s Government and of Russian Government.

No. 421. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 20, 1912. LOAN proposals contained in your telegram of 13th November to St. Petersburgh have been communicated to Russian Minister from St. Petersburgh. He is strongly of opinion that if two Governments are disposed to guarantee a loan they should do so for one of a larger amount, since he considers security available is such as would not entail much risk on guaranteeing Governments, whilst such guarantee would secure financial advantages to Persia such as could not be hoped for under other conditions. I agree if proper supervision of collection and expenditure is insisted on. The cost of a small army is estimated at 3,500,000 tomans a-year, and of gendarmerie at nearly 1,000,000 tomans, so that almost all the loan would be exhausted in one year. It would hardly be advisable to obtain foreign officers on such a financial basis. The situation of gendarmerie is becoming precarious. It has existed so far almost entirely on sums earmarked for service out of advances, and now that treasurer- general is solely dependent on the national resources he is over 5,000/. in arrears on the last Persian month, and nothing has been paid in towards expenses of current month, although money is due in advance.219 No. 422.

Foreign Office, November 20, 1912. THE only justification for the action which we have taken with a view to the appointment of Saad-ed-Dowleh as Prime Minister is the fact that money is absolutely necessary to the Persian Government, and that no other appointment appears to be possible which would enable the two Governments to make an advance to be followed by a larger loan by financiers. The concession for the Julfa Railway is, we gather, required by the Russian Government as a condition prior to the grant of any advance. His Majesty’s Govern ment expect that the concession for the Mohammerah Railway will at the same time be given to this country. If, therefore, these two concessions are granted by Saad, I understand that the Russian and British Governments will either guarantee or themselves make an advance up to 1,000,000L, subject to proper conditions, for certain specified purposes. The two Governments should also, I think, support Saad’s views as to the convo cation of a Medjliss and the formation of a Senate (see Tehran telegram of the 17th November). I wish to know whether the above views are fully shared by the Russian Government.

These are absolutely necessary preliminaries to a larger loan— we could not press for the appointment of anyone as Prime Minister unless we could assure him that the immediate wants of the Treasury would be met, under, of course, proper safeguards, and I much fear that the general chaotic situation in Persia will be aggravated if the present deplorable condition of affair's is allowed to continue.

The problem is how to raise a sufficient sum of money to enable the Persian Government to carry on an effective administration, and eventually repay the sums already advanced by the British and Russian Governments. Whatever steps be taken to this end, an interval must elapse between the establishment of machinery and the time when the revenues will be flowing into the Persian Treasury. In the meantime money will be required for the re-establishment of law and order, and until that time it will not be possible to float a loan. It is proposed that the British and Russian Governments should advance 1,000,000/:., secured on Crown jewels, in order to tide over this interval. You should discuss this with M.

They consider first object to be attained is to give Persia a Government capable of conducting the affairs of the country and on which England and Russia can count without fear of disappointment. It is clear that no Government in Persia can do anything without money ; but first a Government must be formed, and then only must money be furnished for it. Question of advance must only be discussed after a new Cabinet has been formed at Tehran, and Russian Government will communicate to me their views on that question later on. Meanwhile they propose that British and Russian Ambassadors at Paris should be instructed without delay to request the Regent to charge Saad-ed-Dowleh with the task of forming a Ministry. If you agree so to instruct Sir F. Bertie, M. Isvolsky will immediately receive similar instructions. Russian Government, in conclusion, expressed the hope that no further delay should occur in the matter, and that pourparlers with the Regent should be begun at once. I reminded his Excellency that you had only promised to approach the Regent with regard to appointment of Prime Minister on condition that the Russian Government adhered to views expressed in your above-mentioned telegram. His Excellency replied that as soon as the Persian Government accorded concession for the Julfa Railway he would arrange question of advance with the Minister of Finance. On my asking whether there was any hope of the Russian Government joining us in guaranteeing a loan for 1,000,000£., his Excellency said that this, he feared, was too large a sum. The Persian Government had, moreover, declined to pledge the Crown jewels as security for such a loan. All that the Russian Government could do would be to consent to an advance that would enable the Persian Government to carry on for some time.

I am not surprised that it has been found necessary to withdraw these posts, as the forward movement seemed to me premature at the time, but the position of the gendarmerie and of the Governor-General will suffer in consequence.

In favouring Saad-ed-Dowleh’s candidature, His Majesty’s Government have been influenced solely by the fact that the establishment of a stable Government appeared to them more probable under him than under anyone else. Under such a Government a pecuniary advance of a substantial amount could have been made pending the issue of a loan by financiers. We felt that, unless we could promise financial assistance, we should not be justified in asking the Regent to appoint Saad. Sir G. Buchanan’s telegrams, repeated to you, will have shown you that this course did not meet with the approval of the Russian Government. This alone would have made it impossible for us to take further steps in this direction. In addition to this, we are now convinced by what you say that it would require the exercise of force to make the Persians accept Saad, and to this His Majesty’s Government could in no circumstances consent. There is thus nothing left but to endeavour to secure the establishment, on some other lines, of as efficient a Government as possible, and you should take steps with this object in concert with M.

Memorandum received from the Russian Government states that they entirely agree with His Majesty’s Government that it would not be sufficient to place, at the head of Persian Government an energetic and active man like Saad without providing Government with funds to undertake the necessary reforms. Russian Government consider that it will be necessary to help Persia to conclude a loan for about 5,000,000L or 6,000,0001. An advance such as that proposed by His Majesty’s Government would only delay the conclusion of the large loan, and, moreover, Russian Government are unable to advance to Persian Government the considerable sum suggested. Russian Government consider that the only way to meet the requirements of the Persian Government is to hasten as much as possible conclusion of an arrangement between that Government and Societe cl’Etudes of the trans-Persian railway. Russian Government understand that societe have already chosen representatives to proceed shortly to Tehran in order to negotiate with Persian Government, with support of the two legations, for securing the option to construct trans-Persian railway and per mission to begin preliminary works in return for arranging a large loan for Persia. It is to be hoped that those representatives would be satisfied with the guarantees offered by Persia, and would not find it necessary to insist on any guarantees from Russia or Great Britain. Financiers would then probably undertake to float a loan and to advance at once a certain sum to the Persian Government. Russian Government therefore consider that Sir F. Bertie and. Russian Ambassador at Paris should be instructed to use their influence with the directors of the societe with a view to hastening as much as possible departure of their representatives foi Tehran. Meanwhile Russian Government are ready, as soon as Julfa Railway con cession is granted, to make an advance to Persia which will enable hex to cany on until conclusion of the arrangement with the societe. Finally they express hope that Sir F. Bertie may be instructed as set forth above. No. 446. Sir W. Toivnley to Sir Edward Grey.- (Received December 2.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 2, 1912.

His Highness assured me that he is not animated by any personal feelings of animosity towards Saad-ed-i)owleh, but merely had voiced public opinion in saying that he is unacceptable as Prime Minister. He declared that he could count upon co-operation of all best men in Persia at a day’s notice if required. He added that Cabinet had determined to resist to their utmost any attempt to impose Saad-ed- Dowleh upon country until the assembling of Medjliss, to whom they could present their resignation.

Memorandum by Mr. Shipley on the Events at Tabriz during the 7nonths of December 1911 and Ja7iuary 1912, with reference to the Pamphlet compiled by Professor E. G. Browne a7id published in October 1912. ON p. 5 of the pamphlet it is stated with reference to the attempt which, from August 1911 onwards, Shuja-ed-Dowleh had been making to gain command of Tabriz that the Russian force outside this latter professed to maintain a sort of neutral attitude. This statement does not convey an accurate account of the action of the Russians. The facts are as follows :— On Shuja-ed-Dowleh appearing before Tabriz in the month above mentioned it was declared by the Russians that while they would remain neutral no fighting would be allowed to take place in Tabriz itself, being as they were responsible for the general security of the town. It was this declaration, to which, whatever their ultimate intentions with regard to Shuja-ed-Dowleh may have been, they scrupulously adhered, which, in my opinion, was one of the main causes that no attempt was made by him to enter Tabriz by force during the four months or so he was investing it. It is, indeed, to this neutrality of the Russians that I attribute, as did others, the fact that the town was so long able to hold its own. If, notwithstanding the delay of some four months thus gained for the nationalist cause as against the ex-Shah, no relieving force from Tehran appeared before Tabriz, or any attempt was made by the Central Government to drive Shuja-ed-Dowleh away, this could not be ascribed to any local impediment by the Russians. On the same page of the pamphlet the further statement is made to the effect that the Russians had determined to disarm the fedais, and had eventually succeeded in their task, but only after provoking a certain measure of resistance by their gross mismanagement of the affair. As regards this statement it may be remarked that, whether such a step was being contemplated or not, there was previously to the actual fighting no general disarmament of the fedais by the Russians, though the former may have well believed that some such measure^ would sooner or later have to be taken in231 hand.^ Moreover, though the subsequent events rendered an official enquiry impossible, such independent information as I could obtain left me no room for doubt but that the first shot on the morning following the affray between the police and the patrol on the night of the 20th December was fired by the fedais, the Kussians being everywhere on the defensive. The affray above referred to certainly formed the starting point of the fighting which ensued. But it cannot be too strongly emphasised that this, affray was an isolated incident the responsibility for which was admittedly doubtful, while the suddenness of the outbreak next morning, taking, as it did, the town completely by surprise, and leaving no possibility of enquiry or intervention of any kind, affords very strong grounds for the presumption that the fedais had determined to force matters to a crisis. It is further to be noted that from the beginning the affair was one solely between the fedais and certain of the police on the one hand, and the Bussian troops on the other, and that it was one from which the general Persian population, so far from assisting the former or looking upon it as a struggle for their liberties against foreign oppression, not only held completely aloof from first to last, but on the suppression of the rising, denounced the whereabouts of the fugitive fedais, and gave every assistance in the subsequent search for arms. The causes of the outbreak are in my opinion more remote, and are, as I believe, to be sought for in the undue influence which these fedais together with the police had been gradually allowed to usurp owing to the weakness of the Persian administration, and it was this undue influence which constituted a source not only of intrigue and perpetual unrest in the town, but of constant friction with the Russians. It will be recollected that as far back as February 1910, the. continued presence in Tabriz of the leaders of these fedais, Sattar and Baghar Khans, was felt to be incompatible with good government in the town, and though the two latter were eventually and with no small difficulty got rid of, the great majority of their followers remained. The obvious policy of the Persian Government should then have been to profit by the opportunity afforded by the disappearance of Sattar and Baghar to effect a disarmament of these men, and to form a small independent military force on whose implicit obedience reliance could be placed, and which could be trusted to suppress disturbance impartially and without reference to outside considerations. No such force, however, was ever created by the Persian authorities nor were any steps taken to disarm the fedais, the expedient resorted to instead being the enrolment of some few of the latter in the police. But the police force itself, the members of which w r ere never free from accusations of levying blackmail, and of perpetrating some of the worst abuses of the old regime, especially against those suspected of entertaining royalist leanings, was from the first an object of mistrust to the population, and served to increase rather than otherwise the prevailing feeling of insecurity and possibility of disturbance from the fear of which the inhabitants were irever wholly free. It was,; m fact, the inability of the Persian Government to guarantee order in the town which prevented the withdrawal of the Russian troops, the opinion being expressed to me on more than one occasion by my French colleague, M. Mcolas, that it was the presence of these troops alone which kept the town from becoming the scene of the gravest disorder, nor was it ever suggested to me by any of the European iesic en s a ■ the time had come when they could be withdrawn with safety. If I have dwelt somewhat on this aspect of the matter it is because there can be^ no doubt that the position of these troops was anomalous, and that their withdrawal, had this been possible, would have been desirable. Their presence was unavoidably not without embarrassment to the local authorities m the relations of the latter wit le population, and was further a source of suspicion to the Persians ^ intentions of Russia which the return of the ex-Shah m the summer of 1911 did g to allay. But, whatever may have been the grounds on which the I ersians based these suspicions, no act, locally at least, of the Russians was pomte ou o me m J l ^ s . l ^ of them. As far as my own observation went, nothing was one n f hinder the Persian authorities from dispensing with the necessity of F^^ce these troops viz., by the process of forming a military force of their own such as above referred to! oJ fromktherwise ereat.ng an efficient public service had any senoue attempt been made by them to do so. Unfortunately, the effect of a ^ ° f such as I have described inevitably tended to create a teelmg of “p and antagonism towards the Russians on the part of these police and fedais-^ latter it must be remembered were a number of desperate anti-Russian re from the Caucasus;-if for no other reason than that the presence f th ^ a f c ‘ as a check upon their own proceedings. That some such check was ve ^ded ^» b denied by no one acquainted with the methods of Persian police if left to tBut, though the Russians may not always have been in the right or their methods invariably conciliatory, it should be pointed out that the exercise by them of this check, as also the measures taken by them for the general security of the town, such as the very necessary precaution of placing patrols when disturbances were apprehended, were in the main imposed upon them by the necessities of the position, and above all by the weakness of the Persian administration. During the period of the Governor-General ship of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh matters, owing to the personal influence of the latter, were prevented from reaching an acute stage, and it is possible that, had he remained, an outbreak might have been avoided, for apart from the police and fedais I could see no signs of hostility to the Russians on the part of the general population, towards whom the conduct of the soldiers composing the Russian force had been uniformly good. With the departure, however, of Mukhber- es-Sultaneh in the spring of 1911, and the subsequent arrival of Shuja-ed-Dowleh before Tabriz in the following August, such little respect as had existed for the authority of the Government representatives vanished entirely, the successors of Mukhber-es- Sultaneh, viz., the Imam Kuli Mirza and Zia-ed-Dowleh, being merely puppets in the hands of the police and fedais and their leaders, certain of whom were individuals of the obscurest origin. The town, in fact, numbering it must be remembered some 250,000 souls, was completely left to itself, and rapidly degenerated into a state of such administrative confusion, especially during the month of November and the early part of December, that it was impossible to say that the gravest disorder might not break out at any moment. It was a time of great trouble and anxiety, during which the only stable element was that represented by the Russian troops, and it was admitted, even by those whom I had no reason to suspect of pro-Russian sympathies, that the presence of the latter was a fortunate circumstance for the town. I need only briefly allude to the loss entailed upon the merchants and the sufferings undergone by -the population consequent upon the stoppage of trade and the rise in the price of food-stuffs occasioned by the prolonged investment of the town by Shuja-ed-Dowleh. The effect of these, however, was to render the inhabitants thoroughly weary of the whole situation, and ready to accept any solution or almost any form of government capable of putting an end to the prevailing anarchy. It is further very significant as showing the attitude of the population towards the outbreak that, although these fedais had been the defenders of the town against Shuja-ed-Dowleh, great resentment was subsequently manifested against them and their leaders by the populace, who even subjected the dead bodies of the Sikat-el-Islam and others executed with him to grossly contumelious treatment. It was under the conditions I have described above • that the fedais, who, save for the presence of the Russians, were the uncontrolled masters of the town, took matters into their own hands on the morning of the 21st December, and, be their motives what they may, the savage ferocity which characterised their methods of fighting admits of no justification or excuse. 1 his aspect of the question has been too lightly passed over in the pamphlet, and though it is true, and is to the credit of the fedais, that the lives and property of non-Russian Europeans were at no time endangered by them, the fact none the less remains that from the outset no mercy was shown by them to defenceless Russians wherever found, that no quarter was given, and that such Russian soldiers as were taken were killed and their bodies subjected to shocking mutilation, while strong suspicions were entertained by the Russians that in certain cases torture was inflicted befoie death. I be fact of this mutilation, information respecting which had already reached me from Persian sources, was subsequently amply proved by the photographs shown to me of certain of the bodies recovered after the fighting. The counter-charge at first put forward against the Russian troops, viz., of massacring 500 old men, women, and children, has not been persisted in, and I only refer to it here to add that my denial of it at the time was confirmed by my United States colleague, Mr. G. Paddock. With regard to the further allegations against the Russians of indiscriminately killing women and children during the progress of the fighting, no evidence in support of it was bi ought before me, either at the time or subsequently, and I believe it to be equally unfounded, though it is possible that some women and children may have lost their lives during the bombardment of the houses from which the Russians were being fired upon by the fedais. L wo cases occurred in which inoffensive non-combatants were shot at and killed by the Russians during the progress of the fighting, but these were the only authenticated instances bi ought to my notice, and the enquiries which I subsequently made convinced me that the stories of this having been generally and indiscriminately done by the Russians were not borne out by the facts. It should not be forgotten, as bearing on the credibility of these charges generally, that a certain number of Persian women and ^childien took lefuge in the camp of the Russians, by whom they were kindly treated,and no clearer proof can be afforded of the spirit in which the combat was waged by the revolutionaries than the fact that a Hussian officer, while peacefully superintending the removal of these families, was shot dead by the former in cold blood. It may be noted here that among these fedais there were, as far as I know, no Armenian revolutionaries, the latter having left the town some little time previous to the outbreak. As regards the photographs attached to the pamphlet of the persons executed by order of the Russian court-martial at Tabriz and of those of the houses destroyed by order of the same court, I am unable to say by whom these photographs may have been taken, but it is the fact that certain houses, belonging principally to leading men considered by the Russians to have been the instigators of the rising, were demolished by explosives, and that the executions to the number of about forty, which took place at intervals during the month of January of this year, were carried out by hanging, the bodies being left exposed to the public as in the case of the Sikat-el-Islam and his fellow prisoners, the circumstances attending the execution of whom were reported by me at the time. I should state that, as I did not assist at the proceedings before the court-martial, it is impossible to offer any criticisms as to the justice of the sentences passed by it on the persons executed by its orders, and this applies especially to those who were accused of being the instigators as distinguished from those who took part in the fighting. Some, however, were believed to have suffered unjustly, and the later executions created a reaction of feeling against the Russians among the European residents who considered that excessive and in certain cases undue severity was being shown, while the method of execution and the exposure of the dead bodies in public places, as in the case of the Sikat-el-Islam, were resented by them and caused them to overlook somewhat the extreme and unjustifiable provocation given to the Russians by the revolutionaries. My own efforts I need scarcely say were uniformly exerted with my Russian colleague on behalf of mercy being shown where possible, and in the case of the Armenian Bedros I succeeded in obtaining a delay of three days to allow of an appeal being made by his friends on his behalf to St. Petersburgh. As regards Bedros I can only repeat the statement made to me by my Russian colleague, that the evidence against him was too overwdielmingly strong to allow the verdict of the court- martial to be set aside. With regard to the entry into Tabriz of Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and his taking over the de facto governorship, at the beginning of January of this year, this was done rather with my assent than with my approval, as the following facts will, I think, show. I reported towards the end of November or beginning of December 1911, that is, some three or four weeks before the rising took place, that the great majority of merchants were ready to accept the appointment of Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and I added that, provided such appointment could be made with the consent of the Central Government at Tehran, it seemed to offer a solution of the difficulty. The state of the town was indeed desperate at the date mentioned—all trade with the surrounding country having been stopped, bread-stuffs, further, being imported only by sufferance of Shuja-ed- Dowleh The population, in fact, had already taken the matter into its own hands by- entering into negotiations with tire latter for his entry into the town the negotiations, however, always breaking down on the question of the number of followers to be allowed to accompany him. The character borne by Shuja-ed-Dowleh at Tabriz, and as given to me by those who knew him well, was that, though cruel to his enemies, he had never been known to tolerate pillage or disorder. It was further remembered to is credit that, during the troublous times of the first siege of Tabriz by the royalist forces, he had, though he was himself on the side of the latter, permitted no excesses on the part of his troops. A strong man was needed, and it was felt by the Tabrizhs, an frequently pointed out to me by those well acquainted with the situation, that it was Shuia-ed-Dowleh alone who could fulfil the condition not only of maintaining^ order m the town itself, but of ensuring the security of the trade routes m vicinity of Tabriz of which only one, viz., that from Julfa, controlled by the Russians, had remained open. At the suppression of the rising, towards the end of December, even the semblance of Persian authority ceased, Zia-ed-Dowleh, the last nominal represen tative of the Government, having, before the fighting was over t^n -ffige m my consulate statins' that no one would obey his orders, and that he had no toice what ever on which hf could rely. Under these circumstances, if the ordinary business of the^owJwas tobe'vesumei, there was imperative need of someone able both to carry on the government and make his orders respected. If I assented as I d proposition of my Russian colleague, that this task should b f, Dowleh it was because no one else was available, and because the only other alternative viz., that the Russians should themselves administer the town, appeared to me even ifthis were temporary only, to be open to grave objection. With reference to the cruelties perpetrated by Shuja-ed-Dowleh, the exceptional circumstances in which the town then was did not allow of a full enquiry by me, but on my receiving the reports of them I went to my Russian colleague and strongly urged upon him that these barbarous methods must be put a stop to. The representations which the latter made to Shuja- ed-Dowieh were in so far effective as to the best of my recollection there was no repetition of them during the remainder of my own stay in Tabriz lasting until the 8 th February of this year. H. S. SHIPLEY. Constantinople, December 11, 1912. Affray between Russian Patrol and Police ai Tabriz on the night of December 20, 1912. So far as I could gather, both from Russian and Persian sources, it would appear that on the night in question a Russian patrol was sent out between 6 and 7 p.m. to re-establish telephone communication between the Russian camp and other Russian stations. In order to carry out this work, however, it was necessary at one point to ascend the roof of a Persian police-station. On permission being refused by the police in charge information of this fact was sent by the patrol to the Russian consulate- general. Application for the necessary permission was thereupon made by the latter to the karguzar, who dispatched a messenger to the police-station in question with orders to allow the work to be carried out without further hindrance. Unfortunately, in the interval which elapsed between the dispatch of the aforesaid messenger and his arrival at his destination a quarrel had broken out between the patrol and the police, in which two of the latter were killed. The fact that authorisation was sent by the karguzar for the carrying out of the work at the police-station was, I was informed by my dragoman, communicated to him by the messenger himself; but beyond the statement by the patrol that one of their number was attacked from behind, but by whom they could not say, it being dark, and that they then fired in self-defence, there is no evidence to show how the quarrel originated, all possibility of official enquiry into the matter being precluded by the fighting which broke out next day, and by the developments of the situation at Tabriz to which this fighting gave rise.

His Highness expressed his sincere desire that235 the affair might be lepoited in such a manner as to inflame public opinion in England as little as possible. He said that the 1 ersian Government counted much upon the highly-tried forbearance of ^His Majesty s Government, for which they had had such good reason to be grateful in the past. I said that unfortunate incident was such a one that it was impossible for me to foresee the probable action of His Majesty’s Government, but I added that I felt sure that the Persian Government could count on His Majesty’s Government endeavouring to maintain their traditional friendly attitude, even though it might be judged that the situation called for energetic action on our part on the spot. I also addressed a note to the Persian Government expressing the earnest hope that immediate steps would be taken to trace the criminals and bring them to justice. I have no further details from the British consul, but I learn from the colonel commanding the gendarmerie that the major in command at Shiraz reports the inci dent, adding that two gendarmes were killed and one local rifleman wounded. It would appear from this that the gendarmes guarding the road were present, and it is possible that casualties occurred in endeavouring to protect the caravan, but all accounts say that the British party was attacked.

They must request the Persian Government to state without delay what reparation they are in a position to accord, and the reparation must include, among other conditions, the severe punishment of the tribesmen.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived December 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 15, 1912. FOLLOWING from Shiraz, 14th December :— “ Colonel Douglas has handed me detailed report on incident, drawn up by Major Kettlewell, from which I extract following details :— “ Party consisted of Kettlewell, Eckford, 1 native officer, 26 sowars, 17 followers, and 17 baggage mules. They started from Khanehzinian at 7 A.M., 11th December, half an hour after a party of about 150 Persian soldiers, who were marching down road independently. Twelve men were told off as baggage guards, remainder with officers as advance guard. At the bridge over Kara Agach River, Persian officer of the gendarmerie with two mounted gendarmes who had accompanied Kettlewell to the river galloped on ahead to inspect gendarmerie post at Burjitinuri, on the top of the Sinehsafid Pass. Kettlewell also sent on ahead native officer and two sowars to prepare quarters &amp;t Dastarjin. Scouts were also posted on wooded hills on the left flank. After short halt, party proceeded. Road here runs through jungle for about 1^ miles. Two officers, accompanied by six or seven sowars, had passed beyond jungle, and, just as leading mules were appearing from jungle, hot fire was opened by a party from hills on left. Advanced party galloped ahead, got under cover, dismounted, and started to climb hill. It was difficult to discover enemy through thick jungle, but shots were exchanged, and it is now that Eckford was shot through heart. A few minutes after, Kettlewell saw from crest of ridge 150 to 200 men rush out from bottom of ravine below, towards river-bank. His men fired on them, but they quickly disappeared into jungle. Mean while sowars of baggage guard had crossed to north bank of river and taken up position in low hills. They report that smaller body of robbers joined attack also from the north. Kettlewell now collected men with him, descended hills, and crossed river-bed, taking Eckford’s body with him. They joined other party, and native officer and two sowars who had gone ahead also rejoined party here. Meanwhile robbers appear to have madeoff over hills northwards with the booty. -Whole party then returned to Khanehzinian, moving by north bank of river. During this movement some fifteen to twenty horsemen were seen on hills to north and shots exchanged. Kettlewell states he saw no caravan litter at caravanserai at Khanehzinian or on road. Small party of Persians with three or four mules, who left serai after sowars had started, were robbed and their mules taken. They returned to serai on foot, where Kettlewell saw them, but he had not seen them on road. “ Kettlewell also states that, beyond the firing, no attempt was made to attack his small party. Robbers were apparently only out for plunder, and cleared off at once when they had seized mules. As to the gendarmerie, it would appear that Persian officer when he reached the burj brought his men back along crest of hills, and it was there that they were wounded. Kettlewell only saw them in the distance moving along bills to south when he was returning towards Khanehzinian. Copy of Kettle well’s detailed report will be posted to you by Douglas.” No. 472. Sh*W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived December 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 15, 1912. FOLLOWING from Shiraz, 14th December:— “My preceding telegram of to-day contains all details which can be furnished by Colonel Douglas and Major Kettlewell regarding actual circumstances of attack onthe latter s party It will be seen that not only was there no intention of escorting caravan, but that Major Ivettlewell was not even aware that there was any caravan in his vicinity. As legards your other queries, I beg to report as follows :— 1. Responsibility of tribesmen is not yet known for certain. Governor-Generals secretary informed me yesterday that they were Boir Ahmedi, but other information points to t ieir laving been Dushmanziaris, and other Mamaserris, who are under the influence of Mohammed Ah Khan Kashkuli, together with others of the latters followers. More definite information will be telegraphed to you as soon as it is available. 2. Casualties amongst gendarmes. Major Siefvert now informs me that there are four gendarmes wounded and one rifleman. 3. Regai ding caravan. ^ Reports differ, but latest information gives total number of mules at about 140, of which some 30 only with their loads were carried off, but Major Kettlewell saw nothing of them, and does not know exactly where they were attacked. ‘ 4. It is clear from Major Kettle well’s narrative that attack was not aimed against officers and sowars, but was made purely for sake of robbery, differing from ten previous outrages made ^ upon British officers and their men in vicinity of Shiraz during last twelve months.” No. 473. Sir TI 7 . Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 15, 1912. FOLLOWING from consular officer at Shiraz, dated 15th December:— “ Colonel Douglas asks me to send you following :— “ ‘ During last year 1 have had to choose between keeping officers and men closely confined to the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz or allowing them such latitude as, after consultation with His Majesty’s consul and the local Persian authorities, I thought I might reasonably do. Until quite recently I have thought it advisable to adopt the former alternative, and, although moral effect of such action is exceedingly injurious to regiment, I have, in view of political considerations involved, raised no protest. “ £ With the increased security following temporarily on the arrival of Governor- General and the policing by gendarmerie of the roads in neighbourhood, I have allowed somewhat greater latitude, and accordingly sanctioned trips to Dashtarjin and availed myself of the opportunity to send with them small surveying party under the superin tendence of Captain Eckford, who was himself trained surveyor. In view of result I deeply regret having done so, but submit that the risk was not greater than that incurred by shooting expeditions within a few miles of Shiraz, where small parties of officers and men have frequently been fired at, and there was always chance of encountering a large raiding party.’ ” It has been clear for some time that the situation at Shiraz was well-nigh intolerable for both officers and men, but I had not realised that it was quite so bad as is shown from the telegram just repeated to you. I understand from Mr. Smart that the firing on shooting parties generally was due to the action of villagers, who in the present disturbed state of the province are prone to fire on any armed party on the chance of their being robbers. 5Ahen there has been any doubt on this point, punish ment has been inflicted.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received December 16.) gj r Tehran, November 20, 1912. ’ IN continuation of my despatch of the 1st ultimo, reporting an improvement in the relations between Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Bakhtians, I have the honoui to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty sconsul at Mobammerah, reporting the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement between the two parties. Though the Bakhtiari khans resident in Tehran are not in possession of the terms of the agreement made, they have declared themselves ready to abide by any settlement reached by Sardar-i-Jang. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 474. Consul Hawoith to Sir W. Townley. Sir, _ Mohammerah, October 19, 1912. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Agha Rahim arrived here on the 14th instant to discuss Bakhtiari differences with the sheikh. The result of this meeting has been as follows :— The Jarrahi lands recently bought by the Bakhtiaris are to be resold to the sheikh for the price paid for them, i.e., 15,000 tomans. With reference to the Akili lands, should the Bakhtiaris be able to show that any of their property rests with the Arabs, such property will be returned. To this point I will return. Further, all the agreements recently made with the Amir Mujahid and signed by him will be ratified by the khans and will be signed by all. The sheikh agrees to give up all claims with regard to Shuster on the following conditions. The Governor appointed shall always be a neutral one from Tehran, and Agha Rahim is now to be his assistant and represent both sheikh and Bakhtiari, but neither the governor nor Rahim Khan shall at any time have the right to send a “ mamur ” to any Arabs residing within the country from Dizful and Husseinabad in the north to the southernmost point of the Arabistan jurisdiction, nor shall they send “ mamurs ” to Bilaiti (across the river at Shuster), nor to the Gundezlu, nor to the Kharran lands : should any Arabs, or anyone in the places named, offend, the sheikh will be referred to, and he promises to take the necessary steps to punish them. The Bakhtiaris further ask that Bakir Khan be released with the condition that he shall not return to Shuster. They also ask that the family of the kalantar be allowed to return to the town. This the sheikh has agreed to, and in return the Bakhtiaris have agreed that no harm shall be done to those who were supporters of the sheikh, on account of anything done against the Bakhtiaris in the past; but this agreement does not affect anything they may do to offend in the future. After the arrival of Sardar Jang at Abbid, he and Murteza Kuli Khan with Amir Mujahid will meet the sheikh at Wais, one stage from Ahwaz, and all points will be discussed and matters settled and the agreement signed. I have referred to the question of the Akili lands. After the above-mentioned meeting the sheikh has agreed that on account of certain tents and other stored goods which were lost in the Akili affair, he will make “ a present ” of 3,000 tomans to the khans concerned. He refused to listen to any question of indemnity, and the matter was thus compromised. These arrangements are in every way satisfactory, and should provide a means to terminate the friction which has so long existed between the two tribes. With lands and people who dovetail so much it is impossible to attain a solution which has not its weak points, and there is room still for trouble if the parties to the agreement do not fulfil their contracts, but there appears to be a desire on both sides to make peace, and I have every hope of a settlement which will last for some time to come. The sheikh has made it a condition that the agreement when signed shall be registered at the British consulate. Haji Rais left to-day for Ahwaz to communicate with Amir Mujahid, and mav possibly visit Ram Hormuz. I have, &amp;c. L. HAWORTH, Major, I.A.Sit W.

During the past month several changes have been made in the Russian garrisons at Resht and Kazvin. As a nett result the garrison at Resht has been reduced by 300 men, that at Kazvin increased by 200, and the force in Talish increased by 100. Mansur-ul-Mulk, an agent of the ex-Shah, who for some time past has been living in Tabriz, has now taken up his residence in Resht. Meshed. The majority of the roads in Khorassan are still closed to traffic. M. Leleux, the agent to the Treasurer-General, has raised a force of 200 gendarmerie for the purpose of assisting in the collection of revenue. Ispahan. The town and the province appear to be m a more unsatisfactoiy state than usual. In the town firing by day and by night frequently occurs, and burglaries are rife. Lieutenant R. S. Bullock, of the India Army, and party, who weie pioceedmg fiom Ahwaz to Ispahan, were robbed near Dupulun on the night of the 2i th-^oth C ctober, by some Kugeluis and Bakhtiari. Lieutenant Bullock, his Indian orderly, amd two muleteers were wounded. The Indian orderly died of his wounds, but the remainder of the party managed to reach Ispahan on the 7th November without any furthei mcicent. The Central Government has decided to replace the present Governor-General by Sardar Asjha. Yezd. Sardar Fatteh, the new Governor, arrived at Yezd on the 7th November. Naib Hussein and his son Mashallah, who at one time threatened to oppose Sardar Fatteh at Ardekan, evacuated the town on his approach and returned to Kasham. The merchants and others who took refuge in the consulate w en ai ussein was in possession of the town left shortly after his departure, [1340] ^ UShiraz. The main road from Shiraz to Bnshire has, for the past few weeks, been safe for parties travelling with large escorts.

Kerman. A large portion of the inhabitants of Shehr-i-Babek, the chief town in Sirjan, lately rose against Salar Amjad, the Deputy Oovernor. Taking advantage of his temporary absence from the town, they closed the gates to him, and refused to acknowledge him as Governor. The Governor of Kerman, on hearing of this, sent a force under Sardar Nusrat into Sirjan to assist Salar Amjad. According to the latest reports fighting has commenced between the Sirjanis and the Government troops, but no details are available. Kermanshah. Although Salar-ed-Dowleh has left the district and no formed bands of his followers exist, general insecurity prevails in the country about Kermanshah. The town is quiet, but the people do not feel assured as to the future, as in the absence of an adequate force the Governor is unable to restore order in the environs of the town. His Majesty’s consul reports that the charges for road guards are exorbitant, and that trade, a great deal of which is British, is suffering accordingly. No. 476. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 16.) Sir, Tehran, November 27, 1912. I VERY much regret to have to report that the situation in Ears would appear to have taken a turn for the worse, and that there is grave reason to fear a return to the old state of disorder, if not a still worse condition of things, next spring. As I had the honour to inform you, Sir, in my telegram of to-day’s date, the officer in command of the gendarmerie at Shiraz has reported that he has been obliged to withdraw the force stationed at Zergun on the Ispahan-Shiraz road, because the Governor-General has not been able to fulfil his promise to build forts on the road between Zergun and Shiraz. I am not at all surprised that this retrograde step should have been found necessary, because when the forward movement was carried out, almost immediately after Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s arrival at Shiraz, I opined that it was premature, and that the gendarmerie force at Shiraz was not in sufficient strength to take over the road. It would appear that it has also not been found possible to carry out the entire programme between Shiraz and Kazerun to the south, in consequence of tribal opposition, and of the inability of the Governor-General to supply local tufangchis as arranged. There would also appear to have been difficulty in recruiting. It is by no means improbable that the gendarmes on the road south of Shiraz may have to be called in, and it is perhaps unfortunate that the forward movement was taken in hand until the force had been strengthened. Should such a withdrawal have to be made, it must necessarily influence the position of the Governor-General as well as that of the gendarmerie, which would be much to be regretted. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh on his first arrival appeared to be most successful in recon ciling divergent interests, and it seemed at one moment as if he might succeed in establishing a better order of things, though Mr. Smart expressed himself as sceptical from the first of much real improv.ement resulting ultimately. I believe that the Governor-General has been untiring in his efforts to restore peace, but he has unfortunately been handicapped from the first by the usual want of money, which has cramped his efforts, and made it impossible to carry out his promises. The penury of his treasury has been quickly appreciated by the rival chieftains, who have little by little grown colder in their friendship and more apathetic in their offers of assistance, offers[1340] 241 which were probably only made in the hope that there might be money forthcoming for them. It is to be hoped that the pecuniary assistance now given by His Majesty’s Government may not come too late to enable Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to re-establish himself and create a force without which it would be hopeless for him to attempt to collect the revenues or make himself respected. His Excellency has already sent me a message to the effect that he must resign his appointment as no funds were forthcoming. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 477. Sir W.

The Persian to me the report of the incident furnished by Tehran, December 15, 1912. contained all the details received Government have communicated the Governor-General. It tallies in all essential particulars with British reports, but makes it evident that there was a caravan, of the presence of which Major Kettlewell was ignorant. From the Governor-General’s report it would appear clear that robbers allowed the force of about 100 Persian soldiers, 30 gendarmes, and 10 artillerymen, with 1 Swede and several Persian officers, to pass, and attacked the British party in the belief that they were escorting the caravan they had come out to plunder. The Governor-General adds that the robbers were undoubtedly Boir Ahmedis and that twelve of them were killed, and all the mules laden with goods recovered but three. He also states that fighting lasted for five hours, until the failing light and fatigue obliged the gendarmes and horsemen to cease fighting. I am telegraphing to Shiraz for information on these points, and as to the number of gendarmes and the nature of the cavalry engaged. It is now evident that Captain Eckforcl was the only man killed, though four gendarmes and one rifleman are reported wounded The Governor-General is dispatching a force in pursuit of the brigands, but snow in the passes will render all operations difficult, and urgent orders have been sent to the Bakhtiari Governor of Behbehan and to the Sardar -Jang to collect a large force oi Bakhtiaris and severely punish the Boir Ahmedis, who will thus be taken betwee IjYVO ^~1 POS I fear that there is not much satisfaction to be hoped for from these measures.

No. 479. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received December 17.) gi r? Tehran, November 29, 1912. WITH reference to my telegrams of the 1st and 12th instant, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copies of two despatches from His Majesty’s consul- general at Ispahan, reporting details of the attack on Lieutenant Bullock and party on the road between Ahwaz and Ispahan on the 28th October, and on the subsequent death in hospital of Lieutenant Bullock’s orderly. In accordance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram of the loth instant, I have presented a claim for 1,000L as compensation for the death of the orderly. As regards the effects stolen from the travellers, I have brought the matter to the notice of the Prime Minister, who has promised to telegraph to his kinsman, Sardar-i-Jang, who is in charge of the Bakhtiari road, instructing him to do his utmost to recover the effects. Samsam-es-Sultaneh is adding that in the event of failure to do so, Sardar-i-Jang must pay the value claimed. Should this not have the desired result, I shall present a claim to the Persian Government. I should, however, be glad of your instructions as to whether I should present to the Persian Government, in any case, a separate additional claim for compensation, such as was addressed to the Persian Government in the case of Mr. Smart last January, as compensation for the wanton assault on a British officer who was proceeding along the road in question with the consent of his Government and the knowledge of the local authorities. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 479. Consul-General Grahame to Sir W. Townley. Sir, Ispahan, November 9, 1912. IN continuation of previous correspondence on the subject of the attack and robbery of Lieutenant R. S. Bullock (27th Punjabis) and party marching from Ahwaz to Ispahan at Sard Ah on the 28th ultimo, I have now the honour to transmit herewith enclosed copy of a detailed report of the incident handed to me yesterday by Mr. Bullock, together with a certificate now obtained by me from Ur. Marrable regarding the condition of Sepoy Gulab Khan (27th Punjabis), Mr. Bullock’s orderly, now under treatment in the C.M.S. hospital. I further enclose copies of correspondence regarding this incident between Sardar-i-Jang and myself. I understand that for some weeks past caravans of merchandise and native travellers have been passing up and down the road unmolested. The question which naturally suggests itself is why, with richer booty at hand, the robbers should have selected Mr. Bullock’s insignificant party for such a determined attack. Is seems not improbable that this incident may have been engineered by some of the Bakhtiari khans interested in discrediting the Sardar-i-Jang. I am communicating copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty’s vice- consul at Ahwaz. I have &amp;c. T. G, GRAHAME.Enclosure 2 in No. 479. Lieutenant Bullock's Report respecting Robbery of October 28 near Sard Ab. .AT about half-past three o clock on the afternoon of the 28th October, my party, consisting of myself, one Indian sepoy orderly, one Persian servant, and two Arab charvadars, weie on the road between Shelil and Dopulun, about three farsakhs from the latter place. We were crossing a part of country known as Sard Ab, all riding close together. We had six mules and two donkeys. Suddenly from a sangar about 300 yards above us, on our right flank, a shot was fired followed by a volley. I looked up, and saw from twenty to thirty men. All appeared to be armed, and fired incessantly. Ihe two charvadars replied to the fire with their Martinis and tried to drive the mules on. Almost immediately, however, one of them and my Indian orderly were wounded. I ran back to the latter who had fallen by the side of the road, and seeing that it was impossible to do anything, shouted to the Arabs to cease fire. The robbers then rushed down on us, stripped our coats from us, and leaving one charvadar and the Indian orderly by the roadside, surrounded the rest of us and began to hurry us off up the hill from which they had opened fire, taking the mules and donkeys with them. They did not open any boxes on the spot, but appeared to be in a great hurry to get us away out of sight. In order to hurry him on they soon began to beat my Persian servant and took his shoes from him. At first they behaved well to me, but shortly afterwards one of the robbers came up to me and struck me with his rifle. I knocked him down with my fists, and was then surrounded by three or four more with whom I fought for some minutes until felled by a big stone. Before I could get up one of tliem hit me over the head with the butt of his rifle, half dazing me and causing a lot of blood to flow. I tried to run for it, but my foot caught in a scrub and I fell, and while lying was hit three or four times by big stones which they threw. They then pushed and dragged me along for about two more miles, where in darkness they all halted near a stream. Here we found three Persian peasants who had been captured the day previous at Sard Ab and taken up here. The robbers then debated what to do with us, several wishing to kill me, the Feringhi, and constantly covering me with their rifles. Finally they all went away, driving off the mules and donkeys, and left us. It was bitterly cold. During the struggle my shoes and stockings had been taken from me, and I only had a thin khaki shirt and a pair of riding breeches, both soaked in blood. One of the Persians had matches, and we kept a fire going all the night, and when the sun rose started to make our way in what we guessed to be the direction of Dopulun. I myself with my servant and charvadar went together. I don’t know what happened to the three other Persians. Our feet were badly cut by stones and thorns, and we were about exhausted when some villagers from Gandum Kar saw us and brought us to then house, fed us, and washed our wounds. Two days later mules arrived from Dopulun, where we lode to, and found the other charvadar and Indian orderly who had been taken in by a caiavan the morning after the attack. Both were wounded in the leg. Fiom Gandum Kar I had dispatched a messenger to the consul-general at Ispahan, informing him of what had happened, and in consequence of this a party of sowars, with udmg mules for us, arrived at Dopulun two days later, and conveyed us anothei five faisakhs to the residence of Murteza Kuli Khan, where we stayed two days and were well looked after. From here my orderly and both charvadars were taken in by mules to^ Ispahan, and I myself, with my Persian servant, was driven in a victoria to the residence ol the Sardar-i-Jang, where we stayed one day and were treated with great kindness, ana I made an official report to the Sardar-i-Jang. Here a fresh party of sowars with supplies, clothes, and drugs arrived from Ispahan, whence they had been sent by Sardar-i-Zaffar at the request of the consul-general. , , , T i \ i We then drove in to Ispahan, arriving three days later (/th November) and were received at the consulate-general by Mr. Grahame. My orderly and the two charvadars arrived the same day and were at once admitted into the C.M.S. Hospital, where their wounds were attended to With regard to the tufangchis, or road guards I should like to add Hat m only one instance did I meet any of them actually patrolling, and that at their posts they invariably crowd around passing travellers and demand bakhshish, and unless given something, make it difficult for anyone to pass them.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith enclosed translation of a report dated of the 28th October received by me yesterday morning from Lieutenant Bullock, an officer in the Indian army, regarding an attack made on himself and his caravan on the night of the 27th/28th October, near Sard Ab. I further transmit copy of a state ment made in my presence of Ali Akbar of Ghandum Ivar, the Kasid who brought me Mr. Bullock’s letter. % s } On receipt of the report above mentioned, I at once telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister, and at the same time informed his Excellency Sardar-i-Zaflar. Late last night I received his Excellency the Minister’s reply, instructing me to concert with Sardar-i-Zaffar as to the best steps to be taken to send Mr. Bullock all the assistance of which he may stand in need. His Excellency the Sardar-i-Zaffar informs me this morning that he had already last night written to you on this subject, and will do so again to-day. His Excellency, however, considers it advisable that I should myself write to your Excellency. This letter will be conveyed to your Excellency by a party of Bakhtiari sowars which his Excellency is dispatching this morning to Dehkurd. I have handed to their chief a letter and a sealed bag containing clothes, drugs, and necessaries which Mr. Bullock had asked me to send him. I would request your Excellency to cause this bag and letter to be delivered to Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock further asked me to send him money, but on the advice of Sardar-i-Zaffar, instead of doing so I would request your Excellency to supply Mr. Bullock with any money which he may require. Any receipts of Mr. Bullock’s will be honoured by me. , I would add that His Majesty’s Minister in his telegram above referred to express^ the conviction that he can rely upon the Bakhtiari khans to take proper steps to punish the offenders and recover the robbed goods. I trust that your Excellency will soon place me in a position to report to his Excellency the Minister that the robbed effects have been recovered and the robbers severely punished. Ispahan, November 2, 1912. Enclosure 5 in No. 479. Sardar-i-J any to Consul-General Grahame. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd November. I am most deeply distressed about the misfortune which has happened to Mr. Bullock. From the time of my arrival in the Bakhtiari country till now 1 have been attending to the organisation and security of the caravan road, and have posted sufficient guards at all points to keep continually on the move with caravans and travellers. Unfortunately, this incident took place at Sard Ab, near Dopulun, a place which had been safe and protected, and the guards relying on the safety of those parts had not come with them (Mr. Bullock and party). On receipt of this news, I immediately sent sowars and a little money, with numerous pack animals, on which they mounted Mr. Bullock and party, and brought245 them before receipt of yonr letter, and the men whom I had at the bridge at Dopnlnn had received and attended to them, and had subsequently sent them to Shalamzar, where Murtaza Kuli Khan received them with every attention, and brought them himself to Dehkurd. As Mr. Bullock was anxious to get to Ispahan as soon as possible, I gave a Small sum of money for their expenses, sending Mr. Bullock by carriage, and his party by pack animals. 1 hope they will arrive speedily. I have written to Saham-ul-Sultaneh, my nephew, to start with a large number of men for the Kuhgelui country and chastise the robbers who committed this crime. I hope that by God’s help he will shortly deal retribution to the guilty and recover all Mr. Bullock’s effects from them. Rest assured that even if I have to go myself, I will do so, and give them such a lesson that hereafter they will be afraid to come into Bakhtiari territory. Dehkurd, November 4, 1912. Enclosure 6 in No. 479. Consul-General Grahame to Sardar-i-Jang. IN the matter of the robbery at Sard Ab on the 28th October of Mr. Bullock I have the honour to acknowledge receipt this morning of your Excellency’s reply letter dated the 4th November, and to express my thanks for all the steps which your Excellency—as I learn from your letter—is taking for the punishment of the persons concerned' in this attack, and for the recovery of Mr. Bullock’s effects. I understand from Mr. Bullock that a temporary list of his effects was handed to your Excellency at Dehkurd. I now transmit another list drawn up by Mr. Bullock at my request, in which he has indicated the approximate value of the effects robbed, amounting to 126Z. 16s. (6,847-20 krans), and further lists of the effects of lus orderly, Ghulab Khan, totalling 518'90 krans, and of his servant, Mirza Ismail, totalling 193'6 rupees (711‘60 krans). ■ i • t? n T Air.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received December 17.) ^ Tehran, November 29, 1912. 1 HAVE the honour to chronicle the following recent movements of Russian troops in North Persia, as reported by His Majesty’s acting vice-consul at Resht:— On the 2nd November, 200 Cossacks with eight waggons and four carts containing ammunition and military stores left Resht for Kazvin. About the same time, for several successive nights, an unascertained number of men arrived at Resht during the night from Kazvin by automobile, together with twenty-four carts containing stores and ammunition. About the 1st November, sixty Cossacks with three officers returned to Resht from Talish, and encamped at Busar, 2 miles distant from Resht along the Pirebazar road. On the 5th November, 160 Cossacks left for Russia, others taking their place. These seem to have joined forces with those at Busar, and 150 proceeded to Talish on the 11th November. Another 100 Cossacks and two officers left for Talish on the 28th November. On the 19th November, forty-five Russian infantry arrived at Resht from Kazvin, and left for Russia on the 21st November. On the 27th November, 200 infantry and a few Cossacks arrived at Enzeli from Russia. The Russian vice-consul at Resht informed Mr. Worrall on the 3rd November that whatever movements had taken place consisted merely of intergarrison changes, and that one half squadron of Cossacks had been withdrawn from Talish to proceed to Kazvin, an equal number from Kazvin being due to return to head-quarters in the Caucasus. His Majesty’s acting consul at Tabriz reports, under date of the 24th November, that the regiment sent to Khoi had been replaced by ten companies of the 81st Apsheron Regiment (in all about 700 men), which had come from Khoi. One of the first acts of the new colonel who is in command of the Tabriz garrison was to remove the Russian gallows from the ark. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. naanager of the Imperial Bank at Kazvin reported on the 27th November that the Cossack force, which had been entirely withdrawn, has now been increased to 315 men.

WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 482. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 18.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 18, 1912. MY telegram of 15 th December. I received further note from the Persian Government late last night detailing the measures taken by the Government here and by the Governor-General at Shiraz to punish the tribe guilty of the outrage which resulted in the death of Captain Eckford. These measures include a punitive expedition, with its base at Kazerun, as well as encircling movements entrusted to the Governor of Behbehan, Bakhtiari chiefs, and the Governor of Ispahan. Hope is expressed that within one month the persons implicated in the attack on Smart, as also authors of the recent outrage, will be captured and brought to justice. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I shall see later in the day, has especially requested me to inform you at once of the steps that are being taken to punish the robbers, who are actually now being pursued by 900 norsemen. ^ It is clear that a serious attempt is being made to punish the offenders, but tie season of the year is very unpropitious, and it can hardly be expected that one month will suffice for the purpose. I am afraid that there is small hope that the various authorities called upon to take action will combine together sufficient y oya y to The Governor-General evidently intends to do his utmost to make reparation, and the British consul at Shiraz urges that he should be granted time to develop his_ plans.

FOLLOWING from consul at Shiraz, 19th December :— “ I had another long conversation with the Governor-General last night, during which he again assured me that all possible steps were being taken to identify and punish the robbers. He says that he has dispatched a trustworthy agent with a small party of horsemen to Ardaka and other places, who is busily engaged in securing evidence regarding the identity of the robbers and in trying to trace the stolen goods. In addition to this, Daria Begi starts at once for Kazerun, where he will raise a small local force of some 600 men. Men will also be recruited at Kamarij. These two forces will have dual duty—firstly, of guarding the road for passenger caravans, and more especially of the party of gendarmes who will be returning shortly from Bushire with arms and ammunition, and, secondly, of taking active measures against Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli, whenever the Governor-General considers that all preparations are sufficiently far advanced. The Governor-General is also in communication with Soulet-ed-Dowleh, from whom he expects assistance in the matter. It is not likely that these measures will produce any very definite result, but, at any rate, the general idea is sound, and if in the meantime the Governor-General continues his preparations here for the organisation of a regular force, it may be hoped that by the spring he will be strong enough to take decisive measures against Mohammed Ali Khan (whom he regards as by far the most serious offender), and also against the perpetrators of the last outrage. “He tells me that he has prepared budget for expenditure of 15,000/., which he promises to let me see shortly, but I do not suppose that much progress can be made in any question of finance until after the arrival of the new financial agent.” Further telegram from consul at Shiraz of same date :— “ The identity of the robbers. I have been receiving information on this point during the last few days from a number of different sources. All informants agree that the band included a number of men of Alamaseni tribe, and I have lists of the names of the principal persons said to have been involved. It is also possible that, as the Governor-General avers, Boir Ahmedis also took part in the raid, but they were certainly well supported by the Mamaseni, and by some Kashgais.^ 1 conversed on this matter with the Governor-General last night. He agrees that it is quite possible, and, indeed, probable, that, besides the Boir Ahmedis, the band contained members of the Mamaseni and other tribes. In any case, he is anxious to make the punishment of Mohammed Ali Khan and the surrender of persons concerned in guilt of the attack on Smart the first plan in his programme. When that has been accomplished, it will be easy to deal with the other offenders. “ I have received reliable information to the effect that robbers lost two killed and three wmunded.” No. 487. % Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 20.)

As the Treasury is completely empty, it would be very hard to get any money for the pm pose from Central Government. Suggestion to do so would certainly call forth a reply that part of the 15,000k could well be employed for the purpose, and a refusal to agree to such a course would lead to a delay in the carrying out of the operations.

Though it is very difficult to get anyone to take decided action during the present political uncertainty want of money may compel the Persian Government to sign the railway concessions any day.

Unless there is a negotiator here who is competent to discuss details, it appears to me tobe hopeless to expect to conclude negotiations. _ . , Under the circumstances the best course, I think, would be to obtain rom the Persian Government an engagement in writing that the syndicate shall he allowed to construct the railway, the conditions being left for subsequent negotiation.

The Minister was ' YYurred He expressed grave to ask me to convey to you his prof on n re g 1 ’ t - create in London, coming as it did concern about the impression that the news g customs official on the Turco-Persian so soon on the report of the murder of the Y el ?Yd forraranY and proved friendship frontier, but he expressed confidence in the t™d ”rance a p ^ of His Majesty’s Government not to resolve “ case had been ascertained and the “a “ uUy person and expressed, inincident which had resulted in the loss of life of a British officer at a moment when the Government had commenced to entertain genuine hopes that a new era of improvement was about to dawn in the province of Bars. His Highness assured me that no effort would be spared to trace and punish the criminals guilty of this fresh outrage, and again repeated his earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would once more be patient and give the Persian Government time to carry out the punitive measures called for by the occasion. I thanked the Minister for his expression of regret that he had made in the name of the Persian Government, and said that I would not fail to convey to you, Sir, what he had said as to His Majesty’s Government giving the Persian Government time to carry out the necessary punitive measures. I pointed out to His Highness that the incident was such a serious one that it was impossible for me to foretell what action His Majesty’s Government would consider it necessary to take, and I reminded him that this fresh incident was only one more in a long chain of incidents, some of which had not been reported to the Persian Government, which served to show that the authorities in Pars are unable to protect the lives and property of foreigners. I added that I was convinced that, even though His Majesty’s Government might feel themselves constrained to take energetic action on the spot, no effort would be spared to maintain the traditional friendly attitude of the British Government towards that of Persia. I subsequently addressed a note, of which a copy is enclosed, to the Persian Government reporting on the affair. Upon the receipt of your telegram of the 12 th instant I addressed a further note (copy enclosed) to the Persian Government, and the following day I received a reply from Ala-es-Sultaneh (of which I have the honour to enclose translation). The note merely summarises the telegraphic report of the incident received from the Governor-General, which forms a subsequent enclosure in this despatch, and states that a further communication will be sent me giving the nature of the reparation that the Persian Government are prepared to make. An examination of the report made by Mukhber-es-Sultaneh will show that it does not differ in any material respect from the reports furnished by His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz (which I have had the honour to submit telegraphically). It is not yet quite clear from the Governor-General’s report about the presence of a caravan, or whether by the use of the word “ caravane” the baggage train of the shooting party is intended. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh speaks of a small caravan, as if it were at one moment with the advanced party of Persian soldiers and gendarmes that had no connection with the British party, at another mixed up with the latter. Major Kettlewell reports that he had no knowledge of any caravan on the road at the time, and yet it is clear from Major O’Connor’s telegram of the 14th instant* that there was a caravan on the spot, although reports differ as to its size. It would in any case appear clear that the British party was not acting as an escort to a caravan, and that if it was being*escorted at all it was more likely to have been accompanying the considerable Persian force that appears to have been only quite a short distance ahead of the British party.' The robbers would seem to have allowed this force to pass unmolested, and to have attacked the British party as soon as their mules emerged into the open from the scrub. It does not transpire from Major O’Connor’s report of what occurred that Captain Eckford was killed by the first volley fired by the bandits, although it is so stated in the Governor-General’s report, which is also inaccurate as to the casualties among the gendarmes. Latest information shows that none were killed but that four were wounded. Presumably the gendarmes, who were a short distance in front of the British party with the hundred Persian soldiers, returned to their assistance when they heard the firing, since Mukhber-es-Sultaneh asserts that the combat lasted for five hours and was only stopped by nightfall, and that all the mules that had been carried off, but three were recovered and twelve Boir Ahmedis killed. The colonel of the gendarmerie has also received information from the commanding officer at Shiraz which would seem to show that the gendarmes took part in the encounter, since he reports that the Persian foot soldiers ran away immediately they heard the firing. Copies of two letters received from Colonel Hjalmarson, forwarding abstracts of telegrams from Major Siefvert at Shiraz, are also enclosed. It will be seen that the Governor-General states decidedly that the robbers were Boir Ahmedis, and that he has sent an expedition in pursuit. He also suggests that the Governor of Behbehan, a Bakhtiari, should be instructed to operate against the tribe on the western side of the mountains. The - Assistant Foreign Minister who253 handed me Mukhber-es-Sultaneh’s report on the 15th instant, informed me that orders had been sent to the Governor of Behbehan and to the Bakhtiari leaders-, Sardar Jang and Morteza Knli Khan, who are now at Malanir, to co-operate against the guilty tribe, and the Persian Government are confident that the punitive measures that are being taken will result in the practical annihilation of the Boir Ahmedis, who are constant source of trouble on the trade routes between Ispahan, Yezd, and Kazerun. I expressed great satisfaction that such energetic measures were being taken, but pointed out that the season of the year made it extremely difficult for such operations as those described to be taken, and added that, in my opinion, not only the actual culprits must be punished, but also the village headmen on the road, who were almost equally guilty in that they must have been aware of the presence of such a large marauding force in the immediate neighbourhood, and had not given notice to the local authorities. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 496. Sir W. Townley to Ala-es-Sultaneh. Your Highness, Tehran, December 12, 1912. I HAVE the great regret to have to inform the Imperial Government, through the kind intervention of your Highness, that I have received a telegram froin His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, informing me that a party of twenty-six sowars of the Central India Horse accompanying Major Kettlewell and Captain Eckford, who were proceeding to Hashtarjin to shoot, were attacked on the morning of the 11th instant between Khaneh Zinian and Hashtarjin by a large body of tribesmen estimated at from 200 to 300 men. Captain Eckford was most unfortunately killed, and one s c&gt; w ^ slightly wounded, whilst nine mules belonging to regimental baggage were carried oil. The party was proceeding with the approval of the Governor-General, and was within the region which is now guarded by gendarmerie. j t u It is not known at present to what tribe the robbers belonged, and I have no further details in my possession concerning this deplorable incident.

ON the 27th Zihadjeh His Britannic Majesty’s consulate informed me that two English officers were about to make a shooting expedition to Dashtarjin accompanied by twenty mounted men. In making this communication the consulate asked me to take the necessary steps to facilitate their journey. Seeing that the roads had been secure for two months, and that caravans were passing along them every day, this expedition did not surprise me, and I had no reason to object to it. I gave the necessary instructions to the horsemen and to the gendarmes whose duty it was to guard the roads which would be traversed. I further caused the English officers to be accompanied by two Hadavand horsemen and a Persian officer. The Englishmen started on Monday, while on the preceding Saturday 100 men of the Malayer regiment, Montasserol-Mamalek, Mohammed Ali Khan, an artillery officer, and two other officers, with ten artillerymen, and Captain Nystrom with thirty gendarmes had already started for Kazerun. Captain Nystrom and the Governor of Kazerun went on in front of the small caravan, but the soldiers and artillerymen, as it happened, were accompanying it. On Wednesday the soldiers went on ahead. They came across nobody on the road. The caravan followed. Between Khaneh-Zinian and Dashtarjin the advanced guard and the Government horse were about -|-kilom. ahead of the caravan. The caravan, the Indian horse, and an English officer were behind the advanced guard. The gendarmes saw nobody. An English officer, with an Indian sowar, as well as three gendarmes and a mounted man, were between the advanced guard and the caravan. They came upon the robbers, who opened fire. The English officer and three gendarmes were killed and one of the horsemen was wounded. After this the cavalry and gendarmes fell back, and those who were behind advanced. There was an engagement which lasted five hours. It is stated that the lobbeis, who were Boir-Ahmedis, numbered over 200. They were about 300 in number, and consisted of men on foot as well as mounted men. The English officer who was m t e rear is uninjured, and so are the sowars. The caravan was saved. The Boir- me is lost twelve men ; they had captured several animals loaded with merchandise. I e gendarmes and mounted men recaptured them. Altogether the brigands only secured three loads of merchandise. When night came on tlm gendarmes and horsemen found it impossible to go on with the fight. His Britannic Majesty s consu a e an le colonel confirm these details. The officer who was killed wasimpiu ent m eaving is comrades and advancing too far. He must not, however, be r fij me . ft 0 ^ m . c ’ there was no reason to suspect that the road was insecure. ne mcic en is mos regrettable. But these accidents are events which it is impossible to foresee—like a ^Wb^Tould ^ ^ than j d;d ? What means bad I at my disposal in this country of robbers and brigands? I did all that was in my power. But the banditism of the tribes is well-known. One of them rs terrorising t e road from Abadeh to Sarhad. Another is the terror of the Bushire road. I am cope g an army. Please telegraph to the Governor of Behbehan mstructmg him to s against the Boir-Ahmedis the force of 200 men which he had got Keikha. The Boir-Ahmedis really belonged to the district which is of Behbehan. I am working day and night to organise the country and to mst tute an armed force. I rely on your sense of justice to give me my due The mc.dent is certainly regrettable, especially for myself.

Your Excellency, ' December 14, 1912. I HAVE received your Excellency’s two notes, dated the 12th and 13th instant, respecting the regrettable incident of Captain Eckford, which has caused deep grief to the Persian Government. I have the honour to inform you ol the following details of the incident received by me :— In view of the security which has been established in these districts for the last two months, enabling caravans of merchandise to pass in safety, the British officers wished, with full confidence, to go on a shooting expedition, while 100 soldiers, 2 officers, 10 artillerymen with guns, accompanied by Captain Nystrom and 30 gendarmes, were sent to Kazerun. The soldiers and the artillerymen above mentioned were on the way with a caravan of merchandise. Between Khaneh Zinian and Dashtarjin Captain Eckford, accompanied by an Indian sowar, three gendarmes, and one rifleman, leaves the party and goes ahead towards the caravan of merchandise. Suddenly, and most unfortunately, he meets with the attack and fire of the miscreants. Soldiers from behind and the gendarmes from in front come to the scene of the incident and begin to fight with the miscreants, who lost twelve men killed. The caravan, with the exception of a few loads which had been carried off by the robbers, was conducted by the force. The Persian Government attach the greatest importance to this incident, and are prepared to make adequate reparation, the details of which will be communicated to your Excellency as soon as possible.

But this was m y « Captain Lnndberg had been dispatched in pursuit of the band, f See No. 4/2. [1340] 2 D 3unfortunate chance which might just as well have happened in the case of other officers who were attacked from time to time. . . I am therefore of opinion, unless His Majesty’s Government think it desirable now, in view of repeated outrages and of the generally disturbed condition of Southern Persia, to send an expedition into the country to restore order, there is no reason why this last assault should per se necessitate their doing so. As I understand their policy it is to maintain the existing form of Government as long as possible, and with this object in view you have secured appointment to Pars of the best Persian governor obtainable, and His Majesty’s Government are financing and otherwise supporting^ him in his difficult task of trying to restore order in his province. Experiment is in nature of forlorn hope, but if His Majesty’s Government wish to persevere m their policy I know no special reason why they should now depart from it. # But, as the question has been raised, I venture very respectfully to invite your attention to the broad facts of the case as they present themselves to me. It is notorious that the whole of this part of Persia is virtually closed, and has for some time been in a state of anarchy, which tends to increase rather than to diminish as time goes on. In order to restore order and to protect their interests and subjects, His Majesty’s Government are actually financing the Governor of Pars, and are retaining a more or less effective control of the money which they have lent him. In view of these circumstances it seems to me clear that His Majesty s Government have undertaken very definite responsibilities in Southern Persia, and that if they now desire to make their present policy a success, to restore order under a Persian governor, and eventually to withdraw their cavalry regiment, without being obliged to send a large expedition into the country, they must be prepared to face the necessity of adopting an even more definite and decided'line of policy than that winch they are now pursuing. I refer to more effective control of finances and of the military force which, as I have already reported, the Governor-General proposes to raise. No. 498. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey(Ueceived January 13, 1913.) gh*, Tehran^ December 17, 1912. I HATE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a particularly able despatch which I have received from Mr. Smart, lately acting consul at Shiraz, reviewing the general situation in Pars during the six months immediately preceding the .arrival of the new Governor-General of that province. I would beg leave to call your attention to the lucid and thorough manner in which the aims, ambitions, and objects of the several warring factors in Pars have been classified and summarised. The despatch is a document of great value for anyone who is desirous of arriving at some understanding of the rival pretensions which make it almost impossible to foresee a satisfactory solution of the problem, as long as the repre sentative at Shiraz of the Central Government is precluded by the weakness of the same from playing a bold part sustained by the force of arms. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 498. Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley, Sir, Shiraz, October 30, 1912. THE present lull, after the southward migration of the tribes and the arrival of the new Governor-General, would seem an appropriate time for a review of the general situation in Pars during the past six months. The two months following the defeat of Soulet-ed-Dowleh and his retirement to the lowlands around Firuzabad were a period of extraordinary calm as far as the neighbourhood of Shiraz was concerned. Indeed, .1 have never, during my two sojourns at Shiraz, known the vicinity of the town so peaceful. However, the improvement in the situation at and around Shiraz was not reflected on the trade routes or in the outlying districts. This unexpected peace was due partly to the appeasement of the Kashgai-Khamseh261 S’ PSJh wS!, ° f Kawa “-^Mulk ; and partly to the salutary effect pr ^ ^ c ^ wn fall of a chieftam, around whom a legend, highly detrimental o the authority of the Government, had grown up. But it soon tecaL evident that tins peace had no elements of stability m it. The main factors in its break-up were the question of the attacks on our troops and the pretensions of Mohammed Ali Khan Kashku i. Tie ^khani m the north was, with some severity, endeavouring to obtain a real control over the tribes. He had imprisoned Ayyaz Kiha, the kalantar of the Darashun section of the Kashga.s. This chief, responsible for many of the Kashgai robberies of recent years was the last kalantar to abandon Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and his final submission was of doubtful value. He was replaced by Ali Penah Kiha, a strong partisan of t e i khani, and the allegiance of the important Harashuri tribe was thus secured. The majonty of .the Shishbulukis, who effectively guarded the Sarhad route, were loyal, and even paid some maliat. The chiefs of the Farsimadani tribe, which was retained near Shiraz, were also loyal, but their control over their followers, many of whom were far from loyal, was very slight. The Kashkulis, who controlled the upper part of the Bushire road, were perhaps the strongest supporters of the Government. The lesser tribes were easily kept submissive. Gradually the ilkhani was consolidating his position^ endeavouring to collect maliat. He was obviously endeavouring to bring the Kashgai tribes under the control of the Government, which, however, was unable to lend him the necessary support for the attainment of this object. Probably few of the kalantars viewed with favour this growing consolidation of the ilkhani s power, but there was one kalantar whom it gravely menaced. That kalantar was Mohammed Ali Khan. This chieftain had long been the mainstay of Soulet-ed- Dowleh, and the withdrawal of his support from Soulet-ed-Dowleh had been the main factor in the latter’s downfall. He is at present the most powerful of the Kashgai kalantars, though he has many enemies, even among the Kashkulis. He was quick to realise that the consolidation of the ilkhani’s power would not only prejudice his advantageous position, but would even involve him in considerable personal danger. Kawam-ul-Mulk and the ilk Irani were pressing him hard for the surrender of the culprits of the attacks on our troops. If the ilkhani were allowed to grow much stronger, this pressure might take the form of forcible action. Mohammed Ali Khan began to show signs of restlessness. He demanded the release of Ayyaz Kiha, knowing that it would strike a fatal blow at the ilkhani’s power. Sardar Ihtisham and Kawam-ul-Mulk refused to entertain his request in spite of many menacing letters and veiled threats of secession to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. I am inclined to think that the Persian Government missed their chance by postponing all action pending the arrival of the Governor-General. If at.the end of June, when it became apparent that Mohammed Ali Khan would not surrender the culprits, the Persian Government had ordered Kawam-ul-Mulk and the ilkhani to proceed to punitive measures for their apprehension, it is just possible that the under taking might have been successful. Mohammed Khan, cousin and bitter rival of Mohammed Ali Khan, expressed the opinion, in the course of a ^ visit he paid me towards the end of August, that the most urgent need of the situation was not action against Soulet-ed-Dowleh, but action against Mohammed Ali Khan. The sequel was to show that this opinion, though prompted by personal animosity, was correct. At the beginning of July Mohammed Ali Khan’s position had considerably weakened. Mohammed Khan could no doubt have detached a large part of the Kashkuhs, and the other tribes, jealous of the predominance of the Kashkulis, could probably have been put m motion against Mohammed Ah Khan. Failure to seize the favourable moment gave Mohammed Ali Khan time to organise his plot, which resulted in the recoveiy of his power and the downfall of the ilkhani. Meanwhile, Kawam-ul-Mulk was making arrangements to deal with the Khamseh tribes, whose lawlessness had passed all bounds. 1 strongly suspect that he had, through his deputy, Mirza Fazlullah Khan, sown discord between the Jabbara and Shaybani sections of the Arabs, with a view to facilitating punitive measuies against the divided tribes. Unfortunately, his departure, long delayed by the refusal of the Persian Government to allow him to leave Shiraz, was rendered impossible by the forward movement of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. . About the middle of July Soulet-ed-Dowleh began to show signs of restlessness. His bands began to raid Kevar and to attack caravans of local produce going to and from Shiraz. A small force of Farsimadanis under their chief, Masih Khan, was sent to Kevar to watch these bands. At the end of July a mixed force, 500 strong, composed mam y of Surkhis and other Kumarrehis, of villagers from Firuzahad and other lowlands, under [1340] “ 2 ^ 4the command of Hassan Khan Kashkuli, brother-in-law of Soulet-ed-Dowleh advanced through Khoieh and drove the Government garrison of some fifty Kashkulis, under Ghiilam Hussein Khan Kashkuli, out of Darangan. This development resulted in the closing of the Chenar liahdar- Khan-i-Ziniyan stage of the Bushire road and the exposure of the Shiraz valley to periodical raids. cr i u u Kawam-ul-Mulk began to collect an expeditionary force to reoccupy biakb, and, it possible, to pursue the marauders to Firuzabad. In reply to his summons, some 800 Arabs, under Mohammed Kuli Khan, brother of Asker Khan, the Shaybam chief and’200 Baseris came into the town. They were followed by about 200 Kashgais, under Samsam-es-Sultan, a khan of the _ reigning family. Another 200 Kashgais—Farsimadanis and Kashkulis—were also in the town. Arrangements were made for the collection of another force of Kashkulis_ and Farsimadanis around Khan-i-Ziniyan. While this expedition was being organised Major Siefvert with 260 gendarmes occupied Chenar Rahdar, with the object of watching the fiist stage of the Bushire road, of preventing incursions into the Shiraz valley from Siakh, and, if he considered it advisable, of subsequently co-operating with the Government army against Siakh. I have reported by telegraph the unexpected, single-handed move made by Major Siefvert against Siakh, which resulted in the^ defeat of his men by Hassan Khans force, posted in the fortified hillocks covering Hayangan. The greater part of the gendarmes surrendered without much hesitation, and finally Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom with a few men had to beat a hurried retreat. They fortunately succeeded in escaping, though Major Siefvert was_ slightly wounded in the stomach. The enemy released all the prisoners after stripping them. About 150 rifles and 16,000 cartridges fell into the hands of the enemy. One mountain gun, the breach of which had exploded, was abandoned on the field. The casualties were slight —two gendarmes killed and a dozen wounded, of whom two afterwards died in town. Soulet-ed-Dowleh subsequently expressed his regret at this incident, and promised to restore the captured arms and munitions, but he has not yet put his promise into execution. ^ . This disaster had a deplorable influence on the situation. Had Major Siefvert remained at Chenar Rahdar, he could have rendered the Government useful service in escorting caravans over the first and dangerous stage of the Bushire road, in deterring Hassan Khan’s men from their frequent raids into the Shiraz valley. After the with drawal of the gendarmerie, caravans had to proceed under expensive Kashkuli escorts by a detour through the Tang-i-Surkh, and on one occasion Hassan Khan’s men actually raided the Shiraz valley between the town and Chenar Rahdar. Moreover, this defeat of a Government force greatly increased the audacity and prestige of the rebels. Meanwhile serious discord had inopportunely broken out among the Arabs. Oyer half the Arab contingent left Shiraz for the scene of the strife.. The two parties, Jabbara and Shaybam, sat opposite each other in hostile formation around Murghab for a considerable time. However, both sides apparently decided that prudence was the better part of valour, and no further hostilities followed those which had marked the outbreak of the quarrel. Jabbaras and Shaybanis, in a state of armed and watchful distrust, began to migrate southwards, and gradually separated as their lines of migration diverged. Much bad feeling was occasioned among the Arabs by this discord, which they openly attributed to Mirza Fazlullah Khan, Kawam-ul-Mulk’s deputy. The result of this inopportune outbreak was that Kawam-ul-Mulk was deprived of invaluable Arab support for his expeditionary force. At the end of August Mohammed Khan Kashkuli arrived at Shiraz. His presence was urgently needed to set the expeditionary force in motion. He had been delayed by quarrels with Mohammed Ali Khan. On the 2nd September the Government force, consisting mainly of Kashgais, with a few “ sarbaz,” local sowars, and one gun, moved out of town. About the same date Soulet-ed-Dowleh appeared in person at Darangan. I doubt whether the full Government force numbered more than 600 men, and it varied considerably, many of the tribesmen coming and going according to the requirements of their private affairs. The army never got beyond Chenar Rahdar, developments in the north suddenly transferring the centre of interest from Siakh to Baiza. The ilkhani had been collecting a force and was moving southwards. Soulet-es- Sultaneh, Soulet-ed-DowlelTs full brother, had in the spring, after many hesitations, thrown in his lot with Sardar Ihtisham and been appointed ilbegi. His loyalty was, however, dubious, and he was known to be ambitious of becoming ilkhani. At the beginning of September the ilkhani discovered that Soulet-es-Sultaneh was plotting to bring down some of the tribes to join Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Salar Hishmet, the ilkhani’s full brother, attacked and utterly defeated Soulet-es-263 x A xc*xx^v, U xxx^, juncture the ilkhani showed a deplorable lack of decision and energy. Had he marched promptly to Baiza he could probably have dispersed with little difficulty the insignificant following then round Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Instead of taking such prompt action he advanced in a very dilatory manner, giving Mohammed Ali Khan, who had moved from Ardekan, time to join Soulet-es-Sultaneln Negotiations for peace ensued, Mohammed Ali Khan all the while pretending to be neutral and actuated by the amiable desire of effecting a general reconciliation. It soon became evident, however, that Mohammed Ali Khan, with the help of Haji Mohammed Kerim Khan, the arch-mischiefmaker among the Kashgais, was plotting the ruin of Sardar Ihtisham. He and several lesser chiefs around Soulet-es-Sultaneh telegraphed to the Persian Government and Mukhber-es-Sultaneh that they were dissatisfied with Sardar Ihtisham. They asserted that they in no way supported Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and that they desired the appointment of Soulet-es-Sultaneh as ilkhani. In negotiating with Sardar Ihtisham, Mohammed Ali Khan insisted strongly on the release of Ayyaz Kiha, and at last the ilkhani weakly consented. This concession was fatal. The Kashgais saw that Mohammed Ali Khan was master of the situation and they began to desert to Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Negotiations continued for some time, and Mohammed Khan, leaving the Government army at Chenar Kahdar, proceeded to Baiza to support the ilkhani. At the request of Mohammed Ali Khan and Soulet-es-Sultaneh, Kawam- ul-Mulk dispatched Mudabber-es-Sultaneh, the deputy governor, to Baiza to assist in effecting a reconciliation. He was accompanied by Musteshir-ul-Mulk, ^a registered British subject, who had often acted as secretary to former ilkhams. They did not proceed beyond Guyurn, the attitude of Mohammed Ali Khan and Soulet-es-Sultaneh inspiring them with little confidence. As they were returning to Shiraz they were attacked by Hassan Ali Khan, a minor Kashkuli chief. Mudabber-es-Sultaneh alone succeeded in effecting his escape. His sowars were disarmed, and Musteshir-ul-Mu ^ was made prisoner and handed over to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who, wishing to extract from him a legal transfer of his properties round Firuzabad, long arbitrarily appropriated by Soulet-ed-Dowleh, sent him as a prisoner to a fort near Firuzabad. ^ . Sardar Ihtisham had now apparently lost hope. Suddenly, without warning his partisans, he retired from his camp, while his brother, Salar Hishmet, hanc ec ovei le tribes to Soulet-es-Sultaneh. Sardar Ihtisham arrived at Shiraz on the 29th September. He declared that the conditions which Mohammed Ah Khan and the other kaiantars wished to impose on him were such as would have made him their servant. He saic that if the Government would give him a moderate force he would, with the help of ns supporters, march against Mohammed Ali Khan, whose overthrow he considered essential. Failing this he could not remain ilkhani with any profit to the Government or himself The part played by Soulet-ed-Dowleh in the Baiza developments is obscure. He undoubtedly had some sort of an understanding with Soulet-es-Sultaneh but it seems evident that Mohammed Ali Khan, Haji Mohammed Kerim Khan, and some other Kashgai chiefs really cherished hopes of estabhshing Soulet-es-Sultaneh as a puppe ilkhani. These hopes were inevitably disappointed through the ^ ' d es-Sultaneh. A meeting took place between him, Soul et ^ Ali Khnn npnr Khan-i-Zinivan with the result that Soulet-es-Sultaneh agreed to Ah Khan near tx J &gt; Mohammed Ali Khan and Mohammed Khan patched accompany p s . brother to ]»th proceeded to Shapur.

The famous expeditionary lorce, alterabsorbing the greater part of 20,000 tomans, melted away without having done anything effective. The state of the Shiraz valley, after Hassan Khan’s advance to Siakh at the end of July, grew more and more unsatisfactory. The tribal riflemen, Kashgai and Khamseh, summoned to form the expeditionary army, were more baneful to the Shiraz valley than the marauders they had come to repel. They robbed freely in and around the city, and their chiefs seemed to have little control over them. Kawam-ul-Mulk’s restraining influence grew weaker and weaker. There were several daring assaults on Europeans, for whom the tribesmen had evidently lost their respect. But for the personally friendly dispositions of the tribal chiefs in the town towards the consulate, we might not have got through the tribal migration without more serious incidents. As it was, from the beginning of September, I had to warn the British subjects not to remain abroad after sunset. The raids of Hassan Khan’s men from Siakh resulted in the interruption of the snow supply of the town at the very hottest period of the year, and rendered it dangerous for Europeans or townsmen to circulate at any distance from the city. This state of affairs continued until the tribes had passed Shiraz. As the Kashgais moved southward, the Sarhad route, which had been safe all the summer, was naturally closed. Several large caravans came down in the wake of the Governor-General, and the squadron of the Central India Horse withdrawn from Ispahan to Shiraz. Otherwise caravan traffic with Ispahan has been practically suspended since the middle of September. Since the end of July blocks on the Bushire road have been even more frequent than before, partly owing to the closing of the Chenar Badhar-Khan-i-Ziniyan stage after the occupation of Siakh by Hassan Khan, partly owing to chronic hostilities lower down the road, between Ali Mohammed Kamariji, one of the ringleaders of the attacks on our troops, who is still in possession of Rahdar, and the Kazerunis, helped by their allies of Kamarij, as well as between the Kamarajis, supported by Shabancara, and the adherents of Nur Mohammed Khan of Daliki, under the command of his brother, Hussein Bey, who is in possession of Konartakhteh. Hussein Bey, profiting by the death of Khurshid Khan, seized Cherum, a village belonging to Kamarij and lying on the road between Kamarij and Konartakhteh. The 70,000 cartridges consigned to the Tars Government and seized by Hussein Bey in- August must have, been very useful during the hostilities around Cherum. However, the Kamarijis succeeded in reoccupying Cherum, and peace has, at any rate temporarily, been made between the two contending parties. The extortionate exactions of headmen and roadguards from caravans have shown no signs of diminution, and the rates of transport are as exorbitant as ever. After the retirement of Sardar Ihtisham the road remained practically closed for several weeks, no one being responsible for its protection. I he districts which are of such importance for Shiraz trade have remained closed. South-easteriy Ears, the most important outlet for merchandise imported to Shiraz, is, owing to the interruption of communications with Shiraz, being now largely supplied from Bunder Abbas. As a result of this state of affairs the present year has been the worst on record for Shiraz merchants, who have been unable to clear the goods brought up from Bushire at phenomenal rates of transport. I he director of the Indo-European telegraph department has no doubt kept you informed of the frequent interruptions to the telegraph wires. These interruptions and the assaults on, and robberies of, repairing parties have been far more frequent than in previous yeais, though the usual autumnal total interruption of the southern wires was less prolonged than in the last two years. I he events of the last six months have resulted in a considerable deterioration of the situation generally in Tars. The waning authority of the Government has been almost^ entirely broken up. Even more serious has been the dissolution of tribal authority. ^ I he control of the chiefs over their tribesmen has become largely ineffectual as a lestiaimng influence. The Khamseh tribesmen, with possibly the exception of a part of the Shaybani Arabs under Asker and Mohammed Kuli Khan, are completely nut of the control of their kalantars. The Kashgais, always more submissive than the Khamseh, still lespond to a limited extent to the restrictions of their kalantars, but are tending to become more and more insubordinate. The kalantars have created for themselves a position of independence against which no ilkhani, under present conditions, can successfully assert himself. I have, &amp;c. W. A. SMART.265 No. 499.

Smart, lately acting British consul at Shiraz, recording his appreciation of the services rendered to His Majesty’s consulate by Colonel Douglas and his troops and by Mr. Smith and the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Departme n in Ears respectively. Mr. Smith s services were brought to your notice by my predecessor in connection with the disorders at Shiraz which marked the summer of 1911.

Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. Sir, Shiraz, November 4, 1912. BEFORE leaving Shiraz I wish to record my grateful appreciation of the manner in which Colonel J. A. Douglas has facilitated my work in matters regarding the troops under his command at Shiraz. The position of the troops here has not been easy or pleasant. Colonel Douglas’s tact and forbearance, combined with his considerable experience of Persia, have largely contributed to smoothing away difficulties and to obviating regrettable incidents. In all the trivial cases necessitating negotiations with the local authorities he has consistently facilitated my task by his moderation. Several cases have occurred in 'which the men and their officers have, under misapprehensions, been fired at by villagers or local tufangchis. In such cases, realising that the shots were being fired under misappre hension, they have refrained from retaliation, which might have resulted in untoward complications, and have, after at some danger getting into communication with the villagers or tufangchis, averted bloodshed by timely explanations. ^ Colonel Douglas has always refrained from attaching too much importance to such incidents. Owing to the disturbed state of the Shiraz Valley during the greater part of the last ten months the free circulation of the troops, either in bodies or individually, m the neighbourhood of the town would in all probability have^ led to disagreeable incidents. Colonel Douglas, in spite of the great inconvenience involved, did much to obviate such incidents bv circumscribing the movements of his officers and men according to the changing exigencies of the local situation. But foi his tactful attitude, I doubt whether this year would have passed without serious incidents in connection with the ^Although it may savour of presumption on my part, I cannot while on this subject refrain from expressing my appreciation of the attitude of the officeis and men geneia y in their relations with the native population. Owing to the good-humour and tolerance of both officers and men the sentiments of the townsmen and villagers towards our troops have been of the friendliest nature. r I have, Ac. W. G. SMART. Enclosure 2 in No. 499, Acting Consul Smart to Sir W. Townley. Shiraz, November 4, 1912. ’ ON the eve of my departure from Shiraz I should like to express my gratitude for the invaluable assistance consistently rendered me dunng by Mr J C. Smith, assistant superintendent of the Indo-European telegraphaccruing to this consulate from Mr. Smith’s long local experience, the assistance he has always so willingly lent in dealings with tribal or village headmen, in helping to arrange for the passage of British travellers, in keeping the consulate informed of developments in different parts of the province. As the disorders have increased this assistance has grown more valuable. Moreover, Mr. Smith’s coolness and prudence have rendered his co-operation peculiarly reliable. In the increasing difficulties of his departmental work, occasioned by the disorders and tribal destruction of the wires, Mr. Smith’s ability and his skilful treatment of local magnates greatly reduce the number of cases necessitating the intervention of the consulate. I would also mention Mr. Christmas, inspector of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose popularity among the tribesmen has often been of the greatest assistance to me in arranging for the passage of British travellers and in other matters necessitating negotiation with local headmen or tribal chigfs. 1 have on a previous occasion referred to the great assistance rendered by Mr. Smith and his subordinates in the movements of troops. This assistance has latterly been of great value in the march of the Ispahan squadron to Shiraz and in arranging for the safe passage of caravans bringing supplies for the troops at Bushire. I venture to hope that your Excellency will be able to bring this despatch to the notice of the competent authorities. I have, &amp;c. W. G. SMART. No. 500. Sii' W.

The Russian and Persian Governments have concluded an arrangement whereby the sum of 30,000 tomans (about 6,000L) a-rnonth will be guaranteed by the Russian Bank to the Governor-General of Kermanshah for an indefinite period for the expenses of the provincial administration and the maintenance of a military force. It is hoped that, with the assistance of this assured monthly allowance, the Governor-General may be enabled to bring about a restoration of order on the roads where, at present, commerce is much hampered. In view of the large amount of British trade which enters Persia through Kermanshah, it is essential to obtain a restoration of security on the roads in that province.

TABRIZ and the Central Government. My telegram of the 25th December. I have received the following telegram, dated the 27 th December, from His Majesty’s acting consul at Tabriz :—•u Letter has reached me signed by three leading ecclesiastics, who, however, cannot be regarded as representing public opinion at Tabriz, as most of the population are unaware of the nature of the meeting at the Governor’s house reported in my telegram of the 24th December. The signatories inform me of the substance of telegram which they have addressed to Tehran, and copy of which they state was sent to you. They add that if the present Cabinet Ministers merely exchange offices instead of resigning they will decline to recognise them.” The telegram in question from the ecclesiastics comprises an attack on the Bakhtiaris, the Regent, and the present Cabinet, and concludes with the statement that the panacea for all evils is Saad-ed-Dowleh. So far as I can discover, only three of the signatories are men of any importance. Ala-es-Sultaneh represented to me yesterday, through a third person, that the telegram makes the task of forming a Cabinet doubly hard. He also asked my opinion upon the telegram. I answered that it was a sign that his Cabinet should be announced without a day’s delay, and that no more shilly-shallying was possible. I added that I felt sure the support of the two Governments would be forthcoming to a Cabinet containing some of the leading men of the day, but I reminded his emissary that unless the railway concessions were granted there would be no advance of money. On being assured that the Cabinet would be reinforced by Ain-ed-Dowleh, Yossuk-ed-Dowleh, and Mustauti-ul-Mamalik, who had^ already promised to join, I said that all these three would he most useful members of it, but that as Motamed-ul-Mulk and Mushir-ud-Dowleh (his brother) commanded the confidence of an important section of the people, the services of one of them would be very valuable. I added that some progress would be possible with such elements in the Cabinet, and^ given a sound constructive programme, and that it was quite possible that the Persian Government might then obtain a loan specially earmarked for distinctive seivices.

Since Mukhber-es-Sultaneh shows such a praiseworthy determination to obtain reparation, it would appear to me but fair to give him a chance to do so within a reasonable space of time—say, four months. Should his Excellency succeed, his success would establish him as a powerful governor, and would go far to re-establish peace and order in the province. His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz is strongly in favour of giving Mukhber-es-Sultaneh a fair chance. Ala-es-Sultaneh called upon me this morning to ask me whether I was yet in possession of your views, Sir, as to the attitude His Majesty’s Government should adopt in consequence of the recent regrettable incident. I gathered that the Persian Government are very nervous lest His Majesty’s Government may decide on taking immediate steps to obtain the reparation they may doubt the capacity of the Persian Government to accord. The Minister detailed all the measures the Governor-General was preparing to take, as set forth above, and expressed an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would grant a reasonable delay, in order to allow Mukhber-es- Sultaneh to carry out his punitive scheme, in the success of which his Highness expressed his fullest confidence. He added that the Persian Minister in London would be instructed to express the readiness of the Persian Government to make a suitable monetary compensation, and that he would consult you as to what would be considered a fitting sum. The Minister had also been instructed to express to Captain Eckford’s family the deep regret of the Persian Government for what had happened. I replied that I felt sure that you would much appreciate this spontaneous suggestion on the part of the Persian Government to make a monetary compensation. As regards the previous question, I said that I was not yet in possession of your views . beyond those expressed in the note I had addressed to him under your instructions. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 504. Ala-es-Sultaneh to Sir W. Townley. (Translation.) Your Excellency, _ December 17, 1912. IN continuation of my letter of the 4th instant (14th December, 1912), regarding the regrettable incident of Captain Eckford, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that on the 6th instant (16th December) I and the Minister of the Interior had^ a telegiaphic conversation with the Governor-General of Ears with a view to urging the execution of the orders which had been issued for the appre hension and punishment of the culprits. The Governor-General of Ears states that for the present 300 men of the Government riflemen of the town (Shiraz) and of those along the road have been sent in pursuit of the miscreants. Orders have also been issued to all the Government servants of those districts, and the Governor-General has drawn up a comprehensive plan for raising an army and surrounding the robbers, which plan the British consul has approved. From'' here (Tehran) also uro-ent telegraphic instructions have been sent to the Governors of Behbehan and Ispahan to dispatch cavalry and forces from both these places with a view to surrounding and thoroughly punishing the bandits. According to the hope expressed by the Governor- General of Ears, within a month the punishment of the culprits, both of the incident of Mr. Smart and also of this last incident, will be effected. The Governor-General is waiting for the arrival at Shiraz of the guns and rifles which have reached Bushire. Captain Noren Brandel has left Shiraz to bring these up from Bushire. When his armaments _ have been thus completed the Governor-General will be able to set this expedition in motion. With these preparations, which have been devised and which will be quickly effected, I have the greatest hope that full reparation for this deplorable incident will be obtained. I avail, &amp;c. ALA-ES-SULTANEH.269 Enclosure 2 in No. 504. PrScis ofMulMer-es-Sultaneh’s Replies in Telegraphic Conversation with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of the Interior, December 16, 1912. MR. SMAEl can bear testimony to the fact that on my arrival at Shiraz the town was practically besieged and the roads closed ; now they are open to traffic, and caravans pass daily to any from Bushire. After a spell of forty days’ complete calm, and the establishment of a gendarmerie post at Kazeroon, some British officers expressed the intention of starting on a shooting expedition ; owing to the prevailing security I had no reason to offer any objection. I, however, suggested that a force should accompany them, but they refused on the ground of their own escort being sufficient. What happened afterwards was a pure accident due to the officer detaching himself from the main body and advancing too far; no harm came to the officer who remained behind with the sowars. The consul and the colonel themselves do not attribute this incident to any lack of security on the road, but merely to an unfortunate and unforeseen accident. I have not neglected any of my duties as Governor-General, and am taking the most stringent measures, but these steps can only be productive of a satisfactory result if carried out according to a well-concerted plan of action. It is not yet clearly established that we have had to deal with Boir Ahmedis exclusively ; the base of operations must be at Kazerun. I am devoting all my attention to the immediate transport of arms and ammunition lying at Bushire ; I have sent instructions to all the local authorities, and am busy collecting riflemen that can Ire depended upon. I am holding a council to-day to study the situation. This is not a matter that can be rushed through. I have spoken with the consul, and he is in perfect agreement with my plan of campaign. We shall require a month to collect the necessary force here and at Behbehan, and to put them in the field in accordance with a definite scheme of operations. I hope that within that period of time adequate reparation for the Smart affair and this last accident will be forthcoming. This last incident is one of frequent occurrence in other parts of the world. Immediately upon receiving news of it from the consul, who has the telephone, I sent horsemen to pursue the brigands. I expressed my regrets in writing, and called the next morning to do so in person. The consul admitted that in the present state of the country it was impossible to expect that the unrest of forty days ago should suddenly yield place to a new order of things wherein no plundering and attacks could take place. In a province in which half of the inhabitants are wild and lawless tribesmen no one can deny that wonders have already been achieved, and at the present rate we shall soon reach a period of complete calm and tranquillity. According to a report just received it is now certain that the robbers were Boir Ahmedis, and that they have gone towards Dushmanziari. One of them has been killed there, but I have not yet received the report of the local kalantar. Three hundred horsemen are m hot pursuit. For good reasons the base of operations must be Kazerun. I am busily engaged in collecting an efficient force, and wid dispel all anxiety on the part of the Government. Amir Mujahid must be warned not to have recourse to the Kashgais. Measures taken at Tehran. Most striucrent telegraphic instructions have been given by the Government to the Sardar Jang and other commanders at Ispahan, and to the Amir Mujahid at Behbehan, to dispatch forces immediately in concert with the measures taken at femraz by the Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, whose plan of operations must guide the movements of troops from three directions in order that a crushing blow may be inflicted on the Bon Ahmedis, and the most exemplary and signal punishment meted out to them. I he Sardar Assad has also telegraphed in this sense. Enclosure 3 in No. 504. Consul O’Connor to Sir W. Tovmley. /mi \ Shiraz, December 17, 1912. (Telegraphic.)^ ^ ^ interv ; ew with Governor-Geperal. He tells me he is being pressed from Tehran to take immediate measures ot some kind agams e robbers, “in order to allay excitement in London and Calcutta. His view of gene.asituation coincides with my own. He deplores the tragic death of Captain Eckford and these constant robberies on the Bushire road, but he points out that the general state of order in Ears is decidedly better than it was before he took over charge of the province, and that occasional instances of robbery do not in any way alter the general political situation as it existed say a fortnight ago. He strongly deprecates being forced into premature action against the robbers. It is, of course, he says, quite easy for him to collect usual Persian rabble army and to dispatch it into the hills, but as he very reasonably points out result is a foregone conclusion. No success can possibly attend such ill-considered and unorganised efforts, and failure will leave situation worse than it is now, and will necessitate foreign occupation. He proposes, therefore, unless forced into unwilling action by insistence of his own Government, to continue methodical preparations for organisation of small but competent force on lines already indicated in my previous telegrams—that is to say, enlistment of about 1,000 picked men, whom he hopes to have armed and ready for active operations in about two months. This is his general scheme, and if it at all meets with your approval I venture with the greatest possible respect to urge that it may at least be given a trial. As I have already urged, last incident cannot be regarded as altering fundamentally previously existing situation. Enclosure 4 in No. 504. Consul O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, December 17, 1912. AS reported in my telegram of the 14th December,* only three mounted gendarmes preceded Major Kettlewell’s party. There was no Swedish officer and no artillery. Question of identity of robbers still uncertain. Other sources of information do not bear out Governor-General’s contention that they were Boir Ahmedis; see my previous telegram on the subject. Number of their killed unknown, but reports vary from one to twelve, the fact being that no one knows for certain. None of the stolen mules were recovered, but some loads dropped by robbers were picked up. Regarding part taken by gendarmes in the fight, I have now received the following particulars from Captain Lundberg, who has himself been out to the scene of action to make enquiries. He confirms Major Kettlewell’s report, but says that, in addition to the three gendarmes who went on ahead in the morning and those who afterwards came out of Burj on the Sineh Safid, there were some others who form the daily road patrol from Khaneh Zinian. These latter took up a position on hillock on north bank of river, whence they fired at robbers, and four of the former were wounded. Some of them apparently followed the robbers for some distance, and returned in the evening; but there was nothing in the nature of cavalry engagement. Major Siefvert estimates number of gendarmes engaged at about twenty altogether. I may add that gendarmes appear to have behaved very well, and to have done all they possibly could to assist Major Kettlewell’s party and to drive off robbers. No. 505. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W.

Acting British consul adds that he has certain proof that Shuja-ed-Dowleh evolved the scheme, and that the Governor-General has lent his countenance to it. Mr. Cowan speaks highly of the Belgian administration. A sharp message will be sent to Sipahdar by my Russian colleague to the effect that he is not to obstruct the Belgians.

Tehran, January 5, 1913. AZERBAIJAN. My telegram of the 2 nd January. His Majesty’s acting consul at Tabriz telegraphs under date the 4th January as follows :— “ I have communicated to the Governor-General message conveyed in your telegram of the 2 nd January. His Excellency immediately began to discuss the political situation at an interview which I had with him, and he enquired what attitude His Majesty’s Government would adopt. As the suspicion that he was playing a role in the present movement caused his Excellency some surprise, I informed him that, as a considerable share in the agitation had already been attributed to him by public opinion, it was not surprising that some suspicion should attach to him as he had taken no steps to contradict the report. I suggested that he should take steps to publish his disapproval of the actions of the agitators, and a disavowal of any connection with them. He hinted that were he to do this his life would be in danger ; he therefore declined to take the measures I suggested, but finally asked me to convey the following message to yourself:— “‘That while opposed to Bakhtiari supremacy he was not in favour of Saad-ed-Dowieh nor hostile to Belgians whom, on the contrary, he was helping with all the means in his power.’ “ A few weeks ago I could have assured you that the latter part of the message was true enough ; it may be so still, in spite of Russian consul’s opinion to the contrary. The rest of the message may be taken for what it is worth. The chief enemy of the Belgians here is Shuja. “ Although Sipahdar is powerless, his name carries some weight. Would it not be possible to have instructions 'sent to him through the Minister of the Interior to separate himself from the agitation ? “ He contradicted report that an expedition was to be sent against Tehran. “ Bread agitation has, I am informed, failed.” No. 512. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received January 6 , 1913.) rrTJTr , x* • • . Tehran, December 23, 1912. 1 HE lecent unfortunate incident on the Bushire-Shiraz road occurred at a moment when the Governor-General had commenced the elaboration of schemes which are. somewhat diffeient in nature although ultimately intended to serve the same objects, namely, the restoration of order and the better collection of the revenues of the province.273 117 iTe 6 ° f force &gt; ^er the elaboration of a budget, bmce the military force would be employed to assist in the collection of SltelattTh-: ii implify - understanding endeavouring at the same time to disassociate, as far as bay'l^We what are intended to be permanent measures of admmistration from the special steps that are being taken to punish the authors of the assault on British troops that occurred on the Almost immediately upon his arrival at Shiraz, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh realised that it would be impossible to establish his personal authority in the province and secure the collection of the revenues, unless he could create a military force that would be capable of operating wherever troubles might be found, and which would also be sufficiently numerous and efficient to administer a salutary lesson to any one of the more or less insubordinate tribes as occasion might require. His Excellency estimated that he would want a foice of fiom 1,500 to 2,000 men, picked from the best material at his disposal, which would be independent of the gendarmerie, but, of course, ready to come to the assistance of the latter force if required. For the sake of his own personal position, the Governor-General would, pot unnaturally, prefer that such a force should be attached to himself and be under his direct orders. According to a telegram which I have received from His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh is now busily engaged in the preparation of his military scheme, which would appear to have the cordial support of the principal landowners, who would naturally prefer to see order preserved by a Government force rather than be dependent upon the more powerful of the tribes for the time being. The consul states that the Governor-General now proposes to create a force of only 1,000 picked men, in order to keep within the bounds of his financial resources, reserving to himself the right to increase the numerical strength of the force in proportion as the means at his disposal may allow. Major O’Connor considers Mukhber-es-Sultaneh to be a man possessed of sound ideas and theories, but to stand in need of the guiding hand of an experienced adviser in matters of practical detail. I have discussed the question of the Fars gendarmerie with Colonel Hjalmarson, who informs me that he has now a very considerable staff of Persian officers and non commissioned officers at his disposal in a very efficient state of preparation. He says that he has always calculated upon having a force of 3,000 or 4,000 men in Fars, and that if the necessary funds were forthcoming he has plenty of material of the instructor class at hand to create a force of that magnitude in a relatively short space of time, more especially if Mukhber-es-Sultaneh would co-operate loyally with him in the recruiting of better men than those that have been obtainable in the Shiraz district hitherto. Under such conditions it would perhaps be possible to organise the creation of a sufficiently large force under Swedish direction to allow of a part being devoted exclusively to the requirements of the Governor-General, whilst the remainder would perform the regular duties of the gendarmerie. An organised and well-drilled force of 4,000 men should suffice to restore complete order in the province, more especially if it was recruited from the excellent fighting material that the local tribes could supply. Unfortunately, want of money will make it extremely difficult to carry out such a scheme. At the present moment 70,000 tomans (13,0001.) are due to the gendarmerie for the current Persian month. The treasury is entirely empty and M. Mornard is making vain endeavours to borrow the money where he can. The managei of the Imperial Bank is considering lending M. Mornard the money, although he has no security to offer but the surplus of the southern customs which the tieasuier-general ought to be putting aside to meet the heavy payments due next March. Even should the money be forthcoming this time, it is not clear that there will be any c ance o finding it next month as the treasurer-general has no source of settled income upon which he can rely. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. . 2 E 2 [1340]Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 6.) Tehran, January 6 j 1913. ^ SITUATION in Tehran. Though I am assured that, with a view to rendering the formation of the new Cabinet more easy, as well as to allay the violent feeling which has found expression in Azerbaijan against the Bakhtiaris, the Prime Minister and Minister of War have definitely resigned, the Cabinet crisis still continues. Various reasons are given for the delay. One politician hesitates because his personal friend is not included in the Cabinet, another because no assurances are forthcoming that a large loan can be made. I believe, however, the real cause to be that politicians are afraid that the new Cabinet will draw down great unpopularity on its head by granting the railway concessions. A programme of proposed reforms has been communicated to me by Ala-es-Sultaneh, the prospective Prime Minister. The programme entails a loan of about 3,500,000L, spread over a period of five years, for the upkeep of the gendarmerie, the establishment in several of the principal towns of industrial institutions under foreign guidance, and the conversion of the pensions. Until assurances are received that money will be forthcoming from abroad for these purposes there is a reluctance on the part of certain important elements to enter the new Cabinet. Good results might be anticipated from the first and third items of the programme, but it is difficult to give entire sympathy to the idea of establishing manufactories under Government control, as the experiment in this connection in more enlightened countries than Persia has hardly met with a sufficient measure of success.

Sazonof told me that he would instruct the Russian consul in the sense suggested. He asked me, however, to assure you that it was Persian public opinion that was opposed to the Bakhtiaris, not the Russian Government. According to the reports which reached him Sipahdar was behind the movement, for which Russia was in no way responsible. His Excellency spoke in very pessimistic terms of the general situation in Persia. The military authorities wished to withdraw some of the Russian troops, but the present state of anarchy made this impossible. No Government could be said 'to exist at Tehran, no progress could be made with the question of the railway concessions, and when the representatives of the Comite d’Etudes went to Tehran, as they proposed doing next month, they would find no one there to negotiate with. His Excellency insisted on the necessity of affairs in Persia being placed under the control of some really strong man. No. 515. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 7, 1913. SITUATION in Tehran. My telegrams of the 28th December and 6 th January. The author of the constructive programme of reforms, for the execution of which a foreign loan is necessary, is Motamin-ul-Mulk, the former president of the Medjliss. I had a long conversation with him to-day at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The object of the construction of public works (not factories as previously reported) in the various principal cities is twofold, namely, the construction of works of public utility and the employment of those persons who, when their pensions have been converted, will have no means of livelihood. The treasurer-general supports the programme cordially, and my Russian colleague sees good points in it, though he issomewhat sceptical as to Persian thoroughness. My own opinion is that the programme marks a distinct step in advance, and 1 venture to hope that, provided that a capable Cabinet is formed which may be relied upon to carry it through with the moral assistance of the two Governments, His Majesty’s Government will accord their cordial support. Motamin-ul-Mulk is the pivot upon which the success or failure of Ala-es-Sultaneh to form a capable Cabinet turns. All the best available elements will enter if he consents to join, but, should he refuse, the formation of any sound combination is improbable. His hesitation in the matter is due to his desire to obtain assurances from the two legations that a loan of 5,000,000h or 6,000,000Z. will be made at an early date to meet the cost of execution of the programme of reforms and other demands, and that immediately the railway concessions are signed, an advance on the large loan of 500,000L or 600,0001. will be forthcoming. It is proposed to devote one-half of this money to the gendarmerie and the other half to the beginning of the conversion scheme and the payment of arrears of salaries, because it is felt that if no funds are available for this purpose at the Persian New Year (21st March) the popular outcry will be so great that no Cabinet will be able to stay in office. The future appears to be very black if it is found impossible to form such a Cabinet as Ala-es-Sultaneh is endeavouring to form. The Bakhtiaris are entirely discredited, and the reactionary and subversive movement in Azerbaijan will spread throughout Northern Persia ; the nominal objective of such a movement is a Cabinet under Saad-ed-Dowleh, but its real goal would be Mohammed Ali Mirza, ex-Shah. The moven]ent, which can hardly extend to Tehran without serious disorders ensuing, is being kept alive day and night by Saad’s intrigues. There is abundant proof of Saad’s activities. Disorders in Tehran may have far-reaching effects. As you are aware, Motamin-ul-Mulk is one of the ablest and most enlightened men in Persia, and for the above reasons I spoke very earnestly to him. I said the two Governments could not give the desired assurances respecting a loan to a Cabinet which did not yet exist, but I assured him that the matter should be laid before you at once. I added that I felt sure a constructive programme would be honestly carried out if entrusted to the hands of himself and his prospective colleagues, and that I knew he could rely upon receiving the genuine sympathy of His Majesty s Government for any such programme which promised to be so carried out. I venture to express an earnest hope that the matter may receive the serious and, if possible, favourable consideration of His Majesty s Government, as the moment is, in .my opinion, an intensely critical one.

The Cabinet and Saad-ed-Dowleh. —Saad-ed-Dowleh’s endeavours to form a Cabinet have, for the present, failed. Prolonged efforts made by leading Persian politicians to form a Cabinet without him and representative of the best elements available, exclusive of the Bakhtiaris, have not yet been successful, and Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s Cabinet continues to carry on the Government. Salar-ed-Dowleh. —The Persian Government are negotiating with Salar-ed-Dowleh for his submission on the basis of a pension of 12,000 tomans a-year, and the restora tion of Ms confiscated properties, the Prince to be allowed to reside at Tehran, but not to be given a governorship for the present. His Highness is dissatisfied with these conditions, but the Russian consul at Astrabad has been instructed to bring pressure on the Prince to accept the terms offered. Governorship of the Town. —Sadr-ul-Memalik, formerly guardian of the shrine at Meshed, has been appointed Governor of Tehran vice Yemin-ul-Memalik, who has been appointed Governor of Mazanderan. Dearness of bread. —There have been some slight bread disturbances in the town. Metin-es-Sultaneh, the Treasury official charged by M. Mornard with the control of the flour supplied by the Government to the bakers, is accused of conniving with the bakers to keep up the price of bread. The ‘ DashnaksutivunT —This Armenian revolutionary society has issued a proclamation to the effect that it will no longer support the present “ reactionary ” Government. J Kazvin. The Cossack force at Kazvin which had been greatly reduced has been increased to 325 men. Thiee hundred men of the gendarmerie under two Swedish officers are now stationed on the Kazvin-Hamadan road. Meshed. On the 3rd December Mr. Meriton, Indo-European Telegraph Department, travelling from Meshed towards Tehran on line duty, was attacked by Turkomans near Maiomeh. 1 he driver of the carriage and a servant of the Telegraph Depart ment were kdled and the caravan was entirely looted, but Mr. Meriton succeeded in reaching Maiomeh m safety. A brigand called Jehangir is levying blackmail from all travellers at Miandasht on the same road. distriAt° bberieS ^ tbG ° f 5 ’ 000 ^ are re P orted to hay e taken place in the Turbat j±siraoaa.

A party of Bakhtiari, sent out by the Governor-General, are reported to have come into collision with Kuhgelui tribesmen on the Shnaz road, and to have lost ten killed and wounded. The Bakhtiari khans m Tehran however, state that they have no knowledge of this incident. , e j. e / ln J 0a has^ been safe throughout the month and large caravans ot merchandise have been passing i 1 4 hmedi ’ several chiefs, are reported to have come to Yezdikhast with the object of escorting caravans, in order to gain the confidence of the Government. Naib Hussein is again installed at Kashan. Yezd. An expedition has been dispatched by the governor against Marvas to chastise the robber bands emanating from that district. Travellers report extortionate demands by road guards on the Ispahan route, in one case 4L being asked for a single day’s journey. Kerman. Amir-i-Mufakham has announced his resignation several times during the month, alleging that the Central Government would supply him neither with money nor with cartridges. Some 20,000 tomans have subsequently been paid over to him. It is reported from Sirjan (vide monthly summary, 27th November) that an indecisive battle was fought between Sardar Nusrat and the combined Baharlus and Farsis. The latter forces are said to have numbered over 6,000 men. Seyyid Khan of Bam has collected a force to march against Nawab Khan, the chief of the Bameri tribe. Nawab Khan has concentrated his forces at Dalband, near Bampur. Kermanshah. During the month, discontent and robbery have been increasing in the town and prices have been steadily rising. There have also been rumours of a projected attack on the tow r n by rebels. The state of the province has also been growing steadily worse. The Balawand tribe are raiding in the districts to the south. A section of the Galkhani Guran, under Kambar Sultan, have occupied a position on the Bagdad road and are looting all caravans. Another section of the Guran have been threatening the property of the oil company at Kasr Shirin. No authority exists to cope with these disorders. On the 30 th November Far man Farma officially notified His Majesty’s consul that in consequence of the recall to Tehran of the 150 Cossacks, which constituted his sole remaining force, he had tendered his resignation. His Majesty’s consul fears further disorders in the town as a result of their recall. Seistan. On the 17th December some 100 soldiers attempted to take bast in the consulate, complaining that their pay was in arrears, and that the Persian Government had telegraphed orders dismissing many of them without compensation^ and reducing the pay of the remainder. Among the troops dismissed were fifty camel riders for protecting the Kuhi Malik Siah road. Bepresentations have been made by the legation to the Persian Government with a view to the retention of these lattei and a settlement of the question of the arrears of pay. Major Prideaux took chargn of the consulate on the 26th November, on the departure of Captain Hunter. Shiraz. Major O’Connor, His Majesty’s consul, arrived at Shiraz on the 5th December, in the place of Mr. Smart, transferred to Tehran. n- xxi u j On the 11 th December a shooting-party, composed of Major Kettlewell and Captain Eckford, of the Central India Horse, accompanied by twenty-six sowars and [1340] 2 E 4baggage caravan, were attacked by robbers on the Bushire road, between Khaneh Zinian and Dastarjin. In the firing which ensued, Captain Eckford was killed. The remainder of the party succeeded in returning safely to Shiraz. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has appointed Soulet-ed-Dowleh ilkhani of the Ahwaz. The people of Behbehan refused to permit the sowars of the new governor, Amir- i- Mujahid, to enter the town until letters had been received explaining that the amir was “ under the protection of the Sheikh of Mohammerah.” All the Kuhgelui tribes are reported to be opposed to the Bakhtiari regime in the Kuhgelui country. They are removing their property to the more inaccessible parts of their territory. No. 519. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 13, 1913.) Sir, Tehran, December 23, 1912. UPON the receipt of your telegram of the 26th ultimo, informing me that a sum of 15,000/. had been placed to my credit at the Imperial Bank of Persia for the purpose of assisting the finances of the administration of Ears, I consulted the treasurer-general as to how best this money could be deposited in the bank in such a manner as to secure its being devoted to the purpose for which it was intended, and so as to offend as little as possible Persian susceptibilities, that are apt to be tender when an effort is made to control the expenditure of money advanced to the Government on which interest has to be paid. After a verbal exchange of views with M. Mornard, and some private corre spondence, which resulted in a letter from him dated the 1 st instant, copy of which is enclosed, I had a private conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I then addressed a note to his Highness on the 10 th instant, copy of which I have the honour to enclose, informing him that His Majesty’s Government had consented to make a further advance to the Persian Government of 15,000/., upon the same conditions as the previous advances made during the present year, to meet the pressing financial requirements of the province of Ears. By arrangement with Ala-es-Sultaneh, I sent his Highness the same day a memorandum privately explaining the arrangement made with M. Mornard for the control of the expenditure of this money. I on the same day addressed a letter to M. Mornard confirming the arrangement made, copy enclosed, and issued the necessary instructions to the manager of the Imperial Bank. I also had the honour to advise you of the steps that had been taken and of the Governor-General’s acceptance of the arrangement made by my telegram of the 10 th December. Acting upon the advice of the manager of the Imperial Bank, I subsequently sent a cheque for the 15,000/. to the treasurer-general. I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of his reply, acknowledging the receipt of the money. Upon the arrival of Major O’Connor at Shiraz, he at once proceeded to the discussion of the financial situation with the Governor-General. From Major O’Connor’s telegram, dated the 20 th instant, copy enclosed, reporting a conversation with the Persian representative of the treasurer-general, it would appear that he has formed a good opinion of this gentleman, to whom he gave valuable advice as to the manner in which the finances of the province should be handled. 1 have approved Major O’Connor’s language used on this occasion. The 20,000 tomans referred to constitutes the first instalment drawn from the 15,000/. (say 82,000 tomans) advanced by His Majesty’s Government. I sanctioned its transfer to the Bank of Shiraz at the request of M. Mornard, who was pressed by the Government to send money to Shiraz to meet the immediate expenditure likely to be required for the expedition to punish the authors of the Dastarjin incident. I have advised Major O Connor that this money can only be spent with his approval. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY.Enclosure 2 in No. 519. Sir W. Townley to Ala-es-Sultaneh.

Consul O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, December 20, 1912. ^ QUESTION of finance. . , , n ^ Mirza Mustapha Khan, inspector of finances in Ears, called on me last night to bring me telegram from Mornard, in which he is instructed to examine Governor- General’s budget scheme for expenditure of borrowed money during the next three months, and to show it to consul before telegraphing it to Mornard. Telegi am a so states that the sum of 20,000 tomans will be sent. Mustapha Khan knows nothing about this latter sum, but presumes that it must be intended to meet extraordinary expenses o Governor-General’s measures to punish the perpetrator of the recent outrage. Inspector also showed me summary of budget prepared by the Governor-General. It consists merely of list of lump sums under various headings amounting m all to 99,000 tomans, and inspector is not aware how the total was arrived at, and whether the Governor-General has made any attempt to work the matter ou 111 e al • . U * 6 or ®’ proposes during the next few days to prepare detailed budget himself. He informedme that there are considerable arrears due to the troops and police here, and asked whether it would be legitimate to include these in the new budget. I said that I thought not, as loan of 15,000L was primarily intended to enable the Governor-General so to organise his province during the next three months as to start administration in ensuing financial year in such strength that he would be able to collect his revenue and maintain order throughout his province. I therefore advised inspector so to frame budget that its headings should include only such items of recurring and capital expenditure as might be regarded as lying within normal needs of the provincial administration, and that it might constitute model for ensuing years also ; and to prepare also supplementary budget for such extraordinary expenses as arrears and special punitive expedition. Funds to meet these latter estimates would be forthcoming partly from 20,000 tomans promised by treasurer-general, and partly from such provincial revenues as might be collected before the close of the current financial year. If these resources were insufficient, further grant should be asked for from Tehran. Inspector entirely agreed, and has promised to prepare budget on these lines. He seems to be a sensible man, and has impressed me very favourably. Full details will of course be telegraphed to you for your approval as soon as I receive them officially. Meanwhile, I trust you approve generally of my advice to inspector. It seems to me that if we allow this 15,0001., or any considerable portion of it, to be frittered away in purposes which can be of no permanent use to the province money will be wasted and Fars no better off than it was before. Whereas if the expenditure of this sum is so arranged as to place finances and forces of Fars on a firm basis, and to constitute model for future guidance, we shall have laid the foundations of real constructive policy upon which to build in future years. No. 520. -Sir IF. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 13, 1913.) Sir, Tehran, December 24, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that an arrangement has been agreed to by the Persian Government under which the Cossack Brigade under Russian officers will be increased to about 4,300 men in all. Their present strength is about 1,800 men in Tehran and a newly constituted force of 650 men at Tabriz. The arrangement will necessitate the engagement of two or three more Russian officers. It is not to come into force until a loan of sufficient importance has been made to allow of the necessary funds being forthcoming. The pay of the men has also been augmented so as to equal that of the gendarmerie. This increase of pay will commence on the 1 st January. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 521. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received January 9, 1913.) * Sir, Tehran, December* * 29, 1912. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul a't Kermanshah, reporting upon the condition of the road between the Turkish frontier and Kermanshah, and between the latter place and Hama dan. On the receipt of Mr. Consul McDouall’s despatch I spoke to my Russian colleague on the subject of the disgraceful state of affairs prevailing on the roads in question, as, if the figures given by Mr. McDouall are correct, the exactions reported appear to be worse than on the Bushire-Shiraz road. I then learnt that an arrangement had just been concluded between the Russian and Persian Governments under which the sum of 30,000 tomans (about 6,0001.) a-month will be guaranteed by the Russian Bank for an indefinite period to the Governor-General of Kermanshah, for the maintenance of a military force and the expenses of the provincial administration. The money will be refunded from the next advance or from the receipts of the northern customs when the existing advances have been paid off.283 It is hoped that, with the assistance of this assured monthly allowance, the Governor-General may be in ^ a position to secure a restoration of that order on the roads in his piovince, which is of such vital importance to British trade. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 521. Consul McDouall to Sir W. Townley, Sir, Kermanshah, December 5, 1912. I HAVE the honour to report that at present the exactions on the roads from the frontier to Kermanshah, and from the latter place to Hamadan, are very heavy, and there is no safety on the roads. I have reason to believe that the transporters would gladly pay a smaller fee once and for all if no further exaction were made. During the last year it is estimated that the roadguards have collected between 150,000 tomans (30,000Z.) and 200,000 tomans (40,000Z.) between the frontier and Kermanshah alone. One British subject, owning ninety-one camels on each trip, paid 18 krans (7s.) in all on each camel, divided between twenty different posts. Rahdari on goods is abolished, but it seem impossible to prevent the collection of fees called karasurani or “ salamat-rao ” from the muleteers, and this may not be covered by the abolition of rahdari. A proportion of the transporters are Turkish subjects ; one man is a British subject and the rest are Persians. During the year Tanguz-il, according to the published customs statistics, 4,220,766 batmans of merchandise arrived at Kermanshah. The majority of the animals are mules, taking from 40 to 60 batmans, a number of camels taking up to 70 batmans, and some donkeys taking from 20 to 30. If we take an average of 40 batmans to the load we should have in round numbers 100,000 animals. On the return journev many of the animals are unloaded. Supposing 3J krans per animal were collected on the journey to, and 1J krans on the journey from Kermanshah, a total of 50,000 tomans (10,000Z.) might be collected. From Hamadan to Kermanshah the same amounts might be collected on, say, 70,000 animals, making a total of 85 000 tomans (17,000Z.) altogether, and there would be a further sum from passengers (mounted only) and internal traffic ; this is a main pilgrim route Details as to varying charge for camels, mules, and donkeys would have to be worked out, but the estimate of 40 batmans per animal allows for this. 7 , ,, 1 rv&gt; . It has been estimated that a sum of 80,000 tomans (16,000Z.) should be sufficient to pay for a proper system of guards from the frontier to Hamadan. _ The service would have to be arranged under a European, say, a Swedish gendarmerie officer, who would raise local guards, but who should have a small nucleus of men ^om elsewhere Receipts and expenditure would naturally be under the control of the dnector of customs and revenue. The fees would have to be collected at a fixed place, say, at the bridge of Zohab for the frontier, and at the Karasu bridge for the Hamadan road. _ A nrinfed receipt would be given for each payment, and no other fees, except the grazing fees, would be permitted.” It is doubtful if this could be arranged unUl the autharrty of the governor has been imposed on the tribes who are at present m an almost independent position. j have&gt; &amp;c w. m.'McDouall.

Please take an opportunity of thanking Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs for the instructions which his Excellency has sent to Russian consul at Tabriz. You should inform him that I entirely share his view as to the grave nature of the Persian situation, which makes it necessary for the British and Russian Governments to decide at once as to their future policy. M. Sazonof is, I am sure, no less anxious than myself that the co-operation between the two Governments should continue with a view to the maintenance of the integrity and independence of Persia. For this purpose our best course is, at the present moment, to give all possible support to Ala- es-Sultaneh and to encourage Motamin-ul-Mulk and men like him to join the new Ministry. I hope M. Sazonof may be willing to instruct Russian Minister at Tehran without delay to give assurances similar to those contained in my telegram to Sir W. Townley of yesterday, and generally to extend his cordial support to Ala-es-Sultaneh and Motamin-ul-Mulk. Perhaps the Russian Government would also show their sympathy with the new Cabinet, as soon as it is detinitely formed, by withdrawing a few of their troops from Persia and intimating that the remainder will be withdrawn directly order is restored. This would, I am sure, produce an excellent effect. No. 525. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 11 , 1913.) ^ r ’ TVr . . Bushire, December 16, 1912. IN continuation of my despatch dated the 11 th August, 1912, I have the honour to submit, for your information, a memorandum drawn up by Mr. H. G. Chick on the present condition of the Bushire-Shiraz road, especially in regard to rates of transport and transit impositions levied. J « ra sot It is timely at this juncture, when the road question is in evidence, as demon strating the extreme difficulty of the conditions with which trade to and from the interior has to contend. As it reaches me just as I am leaving head-quarters for some days, I venture to leave it to tell its own tale, and to refrain from detailed comment I am sending a copy to His Majesty’s Minister and to the Foreign Department of the Government of India, together with a copy of this communication. I have, &amp;c. P. A. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident m the Persian Gulf, and Eis Majesty's Consul- General for Ears, &amp;c.285 Enclosure in No. 525. Memorandum on the Bushire-Shiraz Road, from August to October 1912. THIS note records conditions on the Bushire—Shiraz trade route for the period following that covered by my last memorandum up to the arrival of the new Governor- General of Ears at Shiraz, with some observations on prospects in the near future. As fully explained in my last memorandum, the question of “ rahdari,” in its various aspects, is by far the most important feature of the disturbing situation created by the present anarchy and damage to British interests. Until it is completely rooted out, and the sedentary and tribal chiefs prevented by force from exacting it, the existing insecurity will continue. This fact is beginning to be more generally recognised in Persia, if not by the Central Government, at any rate by European interests and by the present provincial governors at Bushire and Shiraz. However, during the period under report, there were additional factors, increasing the anarchic conditions produced by “ rahdari,” and augmenting the difficult position in which trade in Southern Persia is now situated. These include hostilities between districts along the route, rates of hire, insufficiency of mules, and the state of the Shiraz- Ispahan and the Ahwaz-Ispahan roads. “ Rahdari. ,, According to the list included in my previous memorandum, totals of exactions by khans and tufangchis had risen :— Krans per Mule. 3-70 From— June 1907 January 1910 February „ March „ April ,, To- September 1911 January 1912 March „ May „ 11-15 9-75 9-35 7-10 17-95 28-12 21-35 27-50 Personal and careful enquiries from muleteers since August have shown me that exactions have been far more severe than previous to that date. . Specimen lists, giving m detail the sums taken ad each place during August, September, and October, are appended. It will be noticed that foui of them exceed 40 krans (14s.) per mule. The totals are : Kr.

It is true that the Governor undertakes to discontinue thislmnost as soon as his financial difficulties with the customs are adjusted Mean- n s impost a q-. • j Tm s hire afford a pernicious example to the while levies of this nature at fehiraz and msnire aumu ^ ^ i lin sn1irnp headmen on the road, and make them the less inclined to forgo this luciative souic of income.Mukliber-es-Sultaneh. arrived at Shiraz in the middle of October fully acqnainted with the urgent need of suppressing “ rahdari ” as the first item in the programme for re-establishing order along the road. He at once sent two Swedish officers and Swedish gendarmes, said to number 150, as far as Kazerun. They were to employ from villages along the road a further 100 tufangchis, who were to be paid by the gendarmerie, and they were to stop all “ rahdari ” between Shiraz and Kazerun. The Governor-General did not propose to deal actively with the road between Kazerun and Bushire, where the position of the tribal chiefs is far more solidly established than north of Kazerun, but he sent a mamur with orders to the khans in question to cease their exactions. These two measures have been practically abortive. By the middle of November the Swedish gendarmerie were withdrawn ; according to the Governor-General’s own statement they had been unable to prevent the local chiefs from Dashtarjin to Kazerun from taking “ rahdari ” or from putting their own tufangchis along the road. From Dashtarjin to Shiraz, a distance of 40 miles only, “ rahdari ” was said to have been stopped, but it is doubtful whether this continues to be the case. As for the special mamur between Kazerun and Bushire, he was, firstly, a man of very mediocre standing, an ex-artillery man from Bushire, and the letters which he bore from the Governor-General showed entire ignorance on his Excellency’s part of the local situation. Bates of Mule Hire to Shiraz. Muleteers under the exorbitant exactions prevailing during the recent few months have of course incurred heavy expenses, but at the same time they have exploited their losses over “ rahdari ” and “ alafi ” in order to get merchants in Bushire to pay higher rates of hire. Of late these have been preposterous. The following figures show the rise in rates, they are per 100 mans, i.e., 775 lb., or roughly two mule loads :— March 1907-08 „ 1908-09 „ 1909-10 „ 1910 .. January 1911 .. March 1911 .. April 1911 May-June 1911 July-August 1911 January 1912 .. February-May 1912 June 1912 July 1912 August-September 1912 October 1912 ..

(55 krans = 1Z.) Thus in the past fifteen months the rate has risen 20 tomans (nearly 4L per 7 cwt.). Dp till August 1911 the rate had never been known to exceed 20 tomans per 7 cwt. ; up till January 1912 it had never passed 30 tomans ; up till June 1912 it had never passed 40 tomans. Not only has the rate touched 50 tomans (9L) for general merchandise, but in October muleteers were asking 32 tomans (about Ql.) for each mule of a convoy of 160 mules to take supplies to the Central India Horse in Shiraz, the total bill, had not the rate been slightly beaten down, would have come to nearly 1,000Z. Considering that the regiment requires constant dispatch of provisions, it will be seen how costly these rates, and the anarchy that has occasioned them, are proving for the British Government. As for the way in which His Majesty’s officers and Europeans are affected, it suffices to note that muleteers would not take two and a-half loads of wine for Mr. Smart in Shiraz under a rate which worked out at 70 tomans (13Z.) per mule load. With rates of hire from Bushire to Shiraz never less than 40 tomans per 7 ’cwt., nearly 20 Z. per ton, during the past six months, and from Shiraz to Ispahan, 38 tomans or more per 7 cwt., it will be realised how hopelessly impossible it has been to put goods fiom the south on the Ispahan market at prices that would pay. It has not even paid to transpoit many classes of goods as far as Shiraz.

Not only will the damage to British influence and to British firms engaged in Persian trade be enormous, but it is peculiarly unfortunate just as railway concessions are in course of discussion. Since July the diaries of His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan point to a great increase of Russian trade to Ispahan from the north. I venture to append extracts covering the period under report:— Juhj 13.—There have been numerous arrivals from Resht and Kazvin. July 20. —Numerous caravans continue to arrive from Resht and Kazvin. August 3.—On the 27th July a large caravan, reported to amount to 600-700 head of transport, arrived from Resht with sugar, &amp;c. August 10.—Large caravans, amounting to about 1,000 head of transport, have left Ispahan for Resht during the week, chiefly laden with cotton. August 17.—A large caravan with specie for the Russian Bank arrived on the 16th instant. August 24.—On the 21st August twenty-three wagons, escorted by Persian Cossacks, arrived from Tehran. Twenty-one of these were laden with Russian piece- goods (335 bales). On the same^date eighty mules also laden with Russian piece-goods. August 31.—Five more wagons, two with Russian piece-goods for Persian merchants, one of groceries, arrived. There have been numerous arrivals of mule and camel caravans with sugar from the north. September 6 .—There were some further arrivals of sugar from Kazvin at the beginning of the week. September 14.—Very large caravans, reported to consist of 2,000-3,000 camels and 400-800 mules and donkeys, arrived from Resht, Kazvin, with sugar, petroleum, and silk. September 4 .—There have been further arrivals of caravans from Resht, Kazvin, with sugar and petroleum. September 28.—Large caravans with sugar and petroleum continue to arrive from Resht, &amp;c. October 5.—Large quantities of petroleum and sugar continue to arrive from the north. November 2.—About fifty-three bales of Russian piece-goods for Persian traders. Further arrivals of sugar also some tea. [134 0 ] 2 FFor this very grave feature of the present condition of the Bushire-Ispahan route, 1 consider that extortionate rates of hire, and the failure of the Persian Govern ment to grapple with the situation, are more to blame than insecurity from robbers on the telegraph route between Shiraz and Ispahan. Hostilities along the Bushire—Shiraz Road. In August, following the forward movement by Soulet-ed-Dowleh and robberies of petty caravans -near Chenar Rahdar, the stage between Khaneh Zinian and that place was thought unsafe for caravan traffic, and muleteers were obliged to make a considerable detour. At the same time fighting was m progress from Ivazerun to the Tan'-i-Turkan between Ali Mohammed, the Kumariji outlaw and Kaslikuii protege, who was implicated in the attack on the Central India Horse in December last, and, on the other side, the Kalantar of Kazerun and the Shabancara and Kumarij tufangchis holding the Kumarij district. „ . m -mi .i Directly hostilities were finished on the Kazerun side of the lang-i-Iurkan, the Kumarijis and Shabancara tufangchis became involved in a prolonged conflict, lasting all September and part of October, with the district of Konar Takhteh and the Khan of Daliki. The Konar Takhteh men captured Cherum, a, village belonging to Kumarij, at the foot of the Kumarij Kotal. The Kumarijis reoccupied it m the middle of September, but caravans were exposed to rifle fire from the hostile watch towers commanding the village, and more than one muleteer was shot or attacked. Caravans were unable for a time to pass this point. For fourteen days m September no mules arrived at Bushire. Later, in the Konar Takhteh plain, part of the Kashkuli clan of the Kashgais joined forces with the Kumarij and Shabancara men, while on the opposite side the Khan of Borazjun sent 100 men to aid his ol\y of ^ The villages of Jafferjin and Banaki in the Konar Takhteh plain have become particularly notorious for their ill-treatment of caravans, extortion, general turbulence, and insulting behaviour to Europeans. The telegraph inspector, a German merchant, the Central India Horse, and British officers have all made serious complaints of treatment received there in 1912, and, together with the district on the Kazerun plain, near the scene of the attack in December last, the Konar Takhteh plain requires early and drastic measures. On the 1st October a convoy of supplies for the Central India Horse were held up for several days by the Khan of Borazjun at that town, and prevented from leaving though he knew well that they wmre hired by the British authorities. This khan has since 1909 taken every opportunity of showing hostility to British troops and interests. In addition, his blood-feud with the neighbouring district of Shabancara and his boorish character make his removal very desirable for the peace of the road. Other caravans wnre held up at the same time, the Khan of Borazjun asserting that he was taking this action more particularly against Kazeruni muleteers in revenge for Borazjunis having been plundered near Kazerun, and for his Shabancara enemies being allowed to establish themselves in Kumarji, higher up the road. The Kalantar of Kazerun riposted by detaining all mules for twelve days, until the Khan of Borazjun released caravans detained there on the 14th October. The section of the road on the coast plain between Borazjun and Daliki was dangerous all October. Shabancara men made a raid and “lifted ” the Daliki flocks ; the Daliki khan lost three men, killed in a night fray in reply to theirs. The kedkhuda of one of the Borazjun villages and several men in both Shabancara and Borazjun lost their lives in similar night attacks. At the end of October and early in November there were hostilities about 20 miles from Bushire, owing to a blood-feud between two villages, one in Tangistan, a little to the right of the caravan route. By the 15th November it was the turn of the first stage between Bushire and Ahmedi. The principal chiefs of Tangistan, who have a blood-feud with the Khan of Ahmedi and were also annoyed with the Governor of Bushire, collected a force on the further side of the Mashileh, near Bushire, while a number of Tangistan riflemen entrenched themselves right on the caravan route, about 10 miles from Bushire, with orders to allow no caravans to pass. A good deal of shooting at long range ensued between them and the partisans of Ahmedi, while valuable caravans at Ahmedi, and all mules in Bushire, including a military convoy, were unable to move for five days. It had already been sanctioned by Government that His Majesty’s troops in Bushire should escort our military convoy across the Mashileh to Ahmedi, when the291 Hussein Dawoni, October.

No. 527. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, January 11 , 1913. YOUR telegram of the 15th December : Murder of Captain Eckford. The question of the policy which we should adopt in the event of the Persian Government being unable to punish the culprits has been engaging my attention, and I have carefully considered your recommendation that we should, in that event, prepare for an expedition of British troops to Southern Persia to exact reparation. This proposal is, in my own opinion, open to grave objections. Such an expedition would entail heavy expenditure, as the force dispatched would have to be large enough to make its success certain, and it would necessarily suffer considerable losses. A more important objection is, however, that we should probably be compelled, after the termination of the operations, to occupy permanently, or at any rate for a long period, a large part of Southern Persia. The independence of Peisia would be finally destroyed, and our action would be the direct cause of the paitition of the country. _ . . . . I am strongly opposed to such a policy. I do not think there is sufficient ground at present for giving up hope of maintaining the independence of Persia. It would, I think, be more in accordance both with our interests as well as with the undertakings which have been given, to direct all our efforts towards establishing a stiong Govern ment in Persia and assisting the gendarmerie to perform its duties in a really efficient The administration may, of course, not be sufficiently strong for some time to establish order among the tribes and inflict the necessary punishment on them; but it we steadily pursue our object, the reckoning must come eventually, and our position will not be seriously affected by this delay. ri -\ i- The dispatch of an expedition should not be urged on the Governor-General of Fars until he is satisfied that there has been sufficient time for its proper preparation, and that it has every chance of being successful. [1340] 2 F 3As regards the gendarmerie, have the funds now been supplied which I understand were needed for it ? It would be better to spend money in strengthening this force than in dispatching an ill-equipped expedition ; and I should have thought that, as the sum required is comparatively small, a special effort would have been made for this purpose. No. 528. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received January 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran^ January 12, 1913. YOUR telegram of 4th January. As was anticipated, a month has elapsed since the attack on British shooting party near Dashtarjin, which resulted in the death of Captain Uckford, without the Governor- General of Ears being able to punish offenders. His Excellency should not, I think, be held to blame for his failure to do so, because task was an impossible one within time limit which he set himself at this season of the year. From telegraphic information received from Bushire and Shiraz, it is clear that measures are being undertaken by Governor-General with co-operation of the gendarmerie to prepare such a force as may be able to operate against the suspected offenders in due course. Commander of Governor-General s military forces has gone with a small force to Kazerun, whence he has proceeded to Borasjun in search of more recruits, having assured himself of the assistance of 200 men at Kazerun and Kamarij respectively under trustworthy leaders. . One of the objects of the movement is to secure safety of Bushire road for passage of a consignment of arms and ammunition which two Swedish officers have gone to fetch from Bushire. These arms have been imported from Europe for gendarmerie, and it is only proposed to bring up a half of them at a time. Swedish officers cannot start from Bushire with caravan until a certain number of recruits have been enrolled, and sufficiently drilled to make them a force on which some reliance can be placed in case of an attack on the convoy, and they are also to be trained in handling of Maxims, of which there are two. It would appear probable that it will be a month before the recruits will be ready to take the road. There was some difficulty at first at Bushire about the recruits, but it wonld seem that good offices of Sir P. Cox have succeeded in smoothing matters over, and that all is going well now. Governor-General is very anxious to obtain possession of arms for the use of force which he is forming, but officer commanding gendarmerie at Shiraz objects, under instructions from here, that they are the property of the gendarmerie and cannot be handed over to anyone outside that force. This contention would appear correct, and yet Governor-General’s efforts will be paralysed if he cannot obtain a portion of the arms, as he has no other source from which to arm his men. It may be possible to effect a compromise. No. 529. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 12, 1913. MY preceding telegram of to-day. Minister for Foreign Affairs called on me yesterday morning to lay before me a scheme for policing of road from Yezdikhast to Bushire, which has been drawn up by Swedish colonel of the gendarmerie. Plan also provides for creation of flying columns, as it is realised that without the addition of such a mobile force it will be impossible to restore order in Fars. ' Ala-es-Sultaneh pointed out that season of the year made it impossible to take any effective measures at present against the perpetrators of the Dashtarjin outrage, but that such preparations as he is in a position to make are being made by Governor- Geueral to punish offenders, if possible, as soon as weather allows. His Highness added, however, that Persian Government are of opinion that the only manner in which order can be permanently re-established is by scheme formulated by Swedish colonel, which provides for employment of a force of about 1,800 men on•293 road. Of these men Ae said that a considerable number have already been enlisted, and are undergoing a course of training which should allow of the dispatch of about 1,000 men to the south this spring. It is calculated that the first detachment will he able to start m about a month’s time. \\ ant of money, his Highness said, is the great difficulty which besets the Persian Government in the creation of this force which it is estimated will cost about 350,000L for three years. This period of time has been fixed because it is confidently believed that, should it be found possible to maintain force in Pars for that time, complete order would be restored in province, which would then be able more than to meet its financial requirements. His Highness, with some natural hesitation, then asked me to approach His Majesty’s Government with a view to ascertaining whether they would once more come to Persia’s assistance by advancing this sum of money to be reimbursed out of the loan which it is hoped will be made shortly. Minister for Foreign Affairs added that not more than half of sum named would be required immediately, but that scheme could not be carried out unless Persia knew that expenses for three years were guaranteed. He gave me to understand that any conditions that might be considered necessary to ensure expenditure of money for the purpose intended would be accepted, and suggested that it should be placed at the complete disposal of officer commanding gendarmerie through the treasurer-general and entirely allocated to requirements of public security in Fars. I am of opinion that gendarmerie under Swedish officers is the sole force to which we can look for a restoration of order and security on Persian highways. On roads where they are already exercising their authority order has been entirely re-established, or a very marked improvement is noticeable. I believe that in future, if money is forthcoming to enable them to establish necessary military force for protection of roads, 100 , 0001 , which could be paid monthly or in accordance with colonel’s requirements, should suffice to meet expenditure for nine or ten months, and I would respectfully venture to recommend appeal to favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government.

Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day gave me an aide-memoire m leply to the letter which I addressed to him. Following is an extract: While most anxious to see a strong Government established, Russian Government do not as yet feel convinced of the working capacity of the new Cabinet. Attitude of the Russian Government must therefore depend on results achieved by the new Ca 3 inet and its good dispositions towards Russia. Russian Government continue to think large loan necessary and will co-operate in its conclusion, subject to necessary guarantees. Thev also agree to an advance on account of large loan without fixing the exact amount beforehand, after the railway concessions have been accorded. The Russian Govern ment sincerely desire the recall of their troops, but as the latter m existing conditions offer the sole guarantee for security of Russian subjects and trade they cannot a present diminish their numbers, nor can they fix a date for their withdrawal, whici must depend on the re-establishment of order. They cannot express an opinion as to the Prime Minister’s programme of reforms, not having yet seen the text In the course of our conversation Minister for Foreign Affairs said that you vould find the Russian Government very accommodating, and that if the new Government proved capable of coping with the situation he would willingly give it his support. I could not induce him to consent to the withdrawal of small poition cl Russian troops. With regard to Shuja, his Excellency said that he was doing all he could to retain'his services, as since he has been at Tabriz there have been no disturbances nor any loss to Russian trade.

You should inform the Persian Government that I am sincerely glad to learn that they contemplate taking serious measures for the re-establishment of order in the south, and that I will most carefully consider what His Majesty’s Government can do to assist them financially in this task as soon as the railway concessions are granted. A considerable part of any advance which we may make might, 1 think, be used for the restoration of order in Pars. It might be paid to His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, as required, and he could be instructed to see that it was profitably expended. No. 533. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.)

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 15, 1913. EARS finances. The Belgian Treasury agent has now reached Shiraz, and has had long and satisfactory conversation with the British consul. He pointed out that, although judicious expenditure of 15,000h advanced by His Majesty’s Government may enable the Governor-General io carry on his administration till the end of the current Persian year, his Excellency will find himself at the commencement of the new year, namely, towards the end of March, in an even worse position than at present, for this reason,that lie will have created a military force, and will have no funds from which to defrav their sa anes. The revenues in Persia are collected at the new year, but in Pars they are recovered during the month of April, May, and sometimes June, when the migrating tubes cross certain points, where they come more or less easily under the in, nu nCe ^ ax ~£ a ^ lerers -. If l le is unable to pay his troops, the Governor-General W1 ii . ('o^dend with their complaints which may easily degenerate into disorders, and will have no force upon which he can rely to coerce tribesmen into paying the taxes. _ I he treasury agent estimates the cost of monthly administration at 40,000 tomans (rather less than 8,000L), and the British consul is of the opinion that funds to carry on for from four to six months are necessary, although it is calculated that if all goes well it will be possible to recover about 90,000^. in revenue during the coming year. I am urging that cost of the administration must be cut down where possible. Expected improvement in security and prosperity of the province will not be sufficiently marked in short time at the Governor-General’s disposal for it to be possible to make an arrangement with the imperial bank of Persia, such as is suggested in your telegram of 3rd December last. I would, however, venture to suggest that it is most essential that the scheme of ‘ practical administration now being elaborated should be continued, whilst irreparable injury may be done if the march of progress is checked, if even for a short space of time, by want of funds. I am of opinion that 30,000h should suffice to enable the Governor- General to place his administration on a thoroughly sound basis, as he would thus be provided with funds until nearly the end of June. I would beg to submit, for your most favourable consideration, that the above-mentioned sum should be advanced to the Persian Government, on the same conditions as the previous 15,000Z., or that it should be especially set aside for the above purpose out of the next advance. YOUE, telegram of the 13th January. I am sorry that Minister for Foreign Affairs does not consider it possible to act as suggested in my telegram of 10 th January, but I hope he will see his way, at any rate, to sending to the new Persian Ministry an encouraging message of some kind. I note M. Sazonof’s assurance that the Russian Government will join in an advance as soon as the two railway concessions which are now being negotiated are granted. This advance will have to be of a substantial sum if it is to be of any use, so I hope the Russian Government will agree to a sum of 250,00Oh It is important that Persian Government should have money to enable them to re-establish order in Ears and to punish the tribes guilty of the murder of Captain Eckford. I therefore propose, subject to M. Sazonofs observations, that, if delay is anticipated, the British share of the advance shall be paid immediately upon the grant of the two railway concessions.

YOUR telegram of the 11 th January : Situation in Southern Persia. As you have decided that a military expedition is undesirable, Iventure to submit that the only alternative policy should be energetically pursued by His Majesty’s Government ■—the policy, I mean, of giving all possible encouragement to the gendarmerie and effectively supporting the central and local administrations specially connected with British interests. I must emphasise the fact that no progress is possible unless both the gendarmerie and the Governor-General are liberally supplied with funds. If this is realised, I am sure that much could be done in a comparatively short time to restore order in Pars. The situation in that province is at present deplorable, perhaps more so than in any other part of Persia. Taxes have for some time ceased to be paid by the tribes, and if the latter are to be made to obey the laws and respect the authority of the Governor-General, it is essential that ample funds be supplied to provide for the requirements of the administration and to maintain a strong military force. If, besides this, it is realised that the British Government are giving their moral and financial support to the Governor-General, I am convinced that he will be able to win over to his cause the jealous and powerful chiefs who so seriously complicate the situation. To extricate the Governor-General from his financial embarrassments and then leave him alone would not now be enough ; it is necessary to supply him with funds until he has had time to establish his position. The provincial revenues would then, I think, soon enable him to repay the sums advanced to him. As regards the gendarmerie, there has in the last nine months been a distinct improvement in the bearing and physique of the men, and as times goes on the officers will acquire greater experience in dealing with oriental troops. They ought to make their mission a success, for they are all smart soldiers keen on their work. But the impoverished treasury cannot properly bear the maintenance of the force, which now numbers about 2,800 men, although the assistance of the Imperial Bank has made it possible to meet (after some unavoidable delays) all expenses up to date.

Sazonof informs me that he is quite prepared to give the new Persian Ministry a fair trial, and he will send them a message of encouragement. As regards your proposal to advance the British share independently, M. Sazonof would like to consider the matter further before assenting. I said the only alternative was for Russian Government to join us in making the advance at once. His Excellency observed that it would be better if the two Governments acted together. He quite appreciates the reasons which make it desirable for His Majesty’s Government to supply the Persian Government with funds without delay. No. 541. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 21.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 21 , 1913. SALAR-ED-HOWLEH. My telegram of the 27th December.

THE Minister for Foreign Affairs assures me that the question of the railway concessions should be settled in a week’s time or less. They are being discussed at meetings of the Cabinet held every day for the purpose. His Excellency impressed on me very strongly that an advance of 600,000L on the forthcoming loan is most urgently required. Persian Government hope that the amount of the loan will be 6 , 000 , 0001 ., paid in five annual instalments of equal amounts. In reply to my enquiry whether it was intended that the 300,000L, which would be the British share of such advance, should include the sum asked for on account of the gendarmerie in Fars, the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that the Government hoped the latter sum would be considered as a separate advance, to be repaid out of the second annual instalment of the loan, additional to the 600,000k which was required at once for general purposes, and which should be regarded as an advance of half of the first instalment.

Minister for Foreign Affairs has sought my good offices in the matter, and considers rifle suggested suitable if not more expensive than the ordinary Mauser. Governor-General can make no progress in formation of his new force without arms. Should the proposal be approved, I would suggest that resident at Bushire is in most favourable position to endeavour to arrange the matter with the Government of India. I gather from authorities on the spot that safe conveyance of the arms and ammunition could be assured. No. 547. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 27.) (Telegraphic.)

No. 560. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 10.) Sir, Tehran, January 16, 1913. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of a report by Major A. M. Kettlewell respecting the attack on a party of the Central India Horse near Khan-i- Zinian on the 11 th December, which resulted in the death of Captain Eckford. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 560. Report by Major Kettlewell on the Movements of a Survey Party of the 39th Central India Horse marching from Khan-i-Zinian to Dasht-i-Arjan on December 11 1912. (THE party consisted of Major Kettlewell, Captain Eckford, Jemadar Soraiyan Singh, twelve men, including one surveyor of A squadron, twelve men of B squadron, two officers’ orderlies, seventeen followers, and seventeen baggage mules.) I started from Khan-i-Zinian at 7 A.M., half an hour after a party of about 150 Persian sarbazes (infantry), who were marching down the road. I told off the twelve men of A squadron to act as baggage guard and to remain with the mules, and used the men of B squadron as an advanced guard and for scouting purposes. Moving from the caravanserai down to the Kara Agach River I had scouts out on the low hills to the right of the road. These scouts had orders to rejoin the party at the bridge. This they did. Until near the river I was accompanied by the Persian officer of gendarmerie with two sowars from Khan-i-Zinian. These then galloped on a-head to visit their post at the tow^er on the crest of the Sineh Safid Pass. Almost immediately after the gendarmes had left me I sent Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and two sowars with orders to trot on to Dasht-i-Arjan, in order to arrive there befoi e the sarbazes and secure accommodation for my men, about which I knew there would be some difficulty. I then crossed the river, sending two scouts on to a small isolated hill (about 300 feet high), about 700 yards south-west of the bridge. 1 then halted on the far bank for ten to fifteen minutes to close up my party before enteung the stup of thorn and tamarisk jungle, through which the road passes for about l£ miles. I started on again at about 8 a.m. sending a scout to ride along the ridge (about 200 feet above the road), which rises some 400 yards beyond the isolated hill mentioned above. I sent forward two scouts to get up on to the next hill beyond this ridge, and two scouts to ride ahead on the road. The two scouts who had been on the first hill then rejoined me, and my advanced party then consisted of Captain Eckford, myself, our four orderlies, and five men of B squadron. At 8-20 a.m. this advanced party had got about 200 yards clear of the strip of jungle, and the leading baggage mules were just appearing out of it when a hot fire was opened on us from the hills, 300 yards to our left. The advanced party galloped to get under the shelter of a hill about 350 yards to the left front, and the four leading mules and four followers joined it here. This hill is of convex section, so that on reaching it we were under cover All the hills near are thickly covered with scrub jungle, so that so far we had seen nothing of our attackeis. On leaching the foot of this hill we dismounted, and leaving tw r o men with our horses began to climb the hill, which was frozen hard and very slippery We had climbed about 40 yards up the hill, and I personally could still see nothing of the enemy, but some of the men must have done so, as they had fired a few shots in return to the fire which was falling ail round us.At this moment Captain Eckford was in the act of taking aim with his revolver, when he suddenly gave a lurch and fell. He was a yard away from me on my left. I went to him and he gasped out “ They have hit me,” and after that became quite unconscious. I left two men with him, and his servant who was down below came up to him. I then with three remaining men moved a little higher up, and towards the east edge of the spur on which we then were. I could then (across a wooded ravine, which ran up into hills) see some of the enemy on the hill on the opposite side (this was the end of the ridge along which I had sent my scout), and as I reached the edge I saw from 150 to 200 of the enemy rush out from the bottom of the ravine and cross about 30 yards of open ground and disappear into the jungle beyond. The first fifty or so of these men had rifles, the remaining appeared to be unarmed. I and the men with me fired at them, but I could not see whether any of them were hit. Up to this time I had no knowledge of what had happened to the men of A squadron and the rest of the baggage mules, but had seen several of the followers run off into the jungle directly the first shots were fired. From where I now was I could see some of the mules emerging from the jungle into the open bed of the river. They were quickly surrounded by Persians and taken out of my sight. I could also see one or two of the men of A squadron who had got on the low hills north of the river. Shots were still being fired at us from the top of the hills on our side. My object now was to try and collect the whole of my men and to remove Captain Eckford. I went back to him and found that he was quite unconscious, but he seemed to still be breathing. I had him carried down the bill and put on a horse in front of one of the men, and then leaving three men to cover my retirement, with orders to rejoin me at a gallop as soon as I was about 400 yards clear, I proceeded with the mules and followers as fast as I could to the right (north) bank of the river. On the way I was joined by Jemadar Soraiyan Singh and the two men who had gone on with him. He reported to me that he had overtaken the Persian sarbazes about halt way up to the tower on the top of the Sineh-Safid Pass (some 2 miles ahead) ; he had then heard the firing. He asked the Persian officer of the sarbazes to return, which he refused to do, and he himself then came back at a gallop along the bed of the river. As I approached the right bank of the river one of the men of A squadron galloped up to me and reported that his party with some followers and mules was on a hill just ahead. I joined them and found that one syce and several mules were missing; sowar Pooran Singh (the scout I had sent on to the ridge when I left the river after halting) was also reported to be missing, but was shortly afterwards reported to be present. Having collected my party I placed the followers, left horse and mule in charge of Jemadar Soraiyan Singh, with orders to keep well under the left bank of the river and level with me ; here they were absolutely under cover from the north, and had a certain amount of concealment from view on the south, afforded by a line of tamarisk bushes in the bed of the river. The country to the north consists of low-rolling hills for several^ miles, with a few bushes here and there on them, but the watercourses which run into the river are fairly thickly covered with scrub. I moved along these hills with my men in two sections, sending these sections forward alternately, and thus reached the road just beyond the bridge at 11-20 A.M. On the way I saw about fifteen to twenty mounted men on a ridge about 1,500 yards to the north and several men on foot in the ravines nearer to me with whom I exchanged shots, and saw at least one of them hit. I also saw fifty or sixty men with rifles on the bridge, but could not ascertain who they were. They eventually disappeared. Desultory shots were being fired most of the time from the hills south of the liver, and I saw three horsemen moving along the hills from the direction of the Smeh-Safid Pass. These after a time I recognised to be Persian gendarmes. On nearing the^ budge I saw thirty or forty men, some of them with rifles, on a small hill 400 yards in front of me, and was preparing to fire on them when they disappeared. Shoitly afterwards about twenty men appeared without arms, and I went up to them. _ They were men from Khan-i-Zmian, and the telegraph ghulam was with them. Directly after my horses had crossed the bridge I was joined by the Persian officer of gendarmerie. He told me that he had had three or four men wounded, and asked me for help to bring them in, but took some of the villagers and riflemen from the village to do this. He then went off, and I did not see him again till about 5 p.m. I now mounted my [1340] 2 Gmen and moved, with scouts out on the hills to the north, hack to the caravanserai at Khan-i-Zinian. On reaching the serai I found that one of my horses had been shot through the chest, one man had been slightly wounded in the heel, and one syce was still missing. The missing syce turned up at 2 p.m. He said that he had run off into the jungle and remained hidden. Nine mules with their loads had been carried oft, and several followers had been stripped of their boots and some of their clothing. As I left the serai in the morning there was a small party of Persians (consisting of three women, two children, with one or two attendants, two pairs of kajawas on mules, and three other baggage mules) getting ready to start. These must have followed close behind me or caught me up when I halted (though I did not see them), as they were robbed and their mules carried off by the tribesmen who attacked me.^ On reaching the river I saw a few of the sarbazes who had started in front of me resting on the far bank. They had disappeared before I got across. I saw no one else on the road either going out or coming back. The only other people in the serai the night before were a few charvardars with a small caravan going to Shiraz. On reaching the^ serai I connected my telephone to the telegraph line and tried to get' into communication with Shiraz, but without success, so I waited until 2 p.m., which I knew was the hour for testing the line, and I then succeeded in reporting what had occurred. During the afternoon four wounded gendarmes were brought in the serai. As far as I could ascertain these had been shot on the hills on the right bank (south) of the river. They had been stripped of their arms and ammunition. When 1 was v/orking back along the left bank of the river I saw the tracks of the party who had attacked me. They had then cleared away to the north. Defterdar Mohammed Zaman, the non-commissioned officer in charge of the baggage guard, states :— As soon as firing started, the syces having fled, I collected my men and tried to drive the mules into shelter, but I was almost immediately surrounded by about 100 tribesmen, who came rushing down the hill and seized some of the mules. Fifteen to twenty horsemen also came up from behind. I then, with what mules I could get hold of, took my men across the river. As I was moving across about thirty to forty horsemen came out from the opposite bank. I got my men on to a small hill on the other side of the river and opened fire on the enemy, some of whom tried to make an attack on me with the object of carrying off the mules I had with me, but they were driven back by my fire. They then went off up a ravine towards the north, and were quickly followed by the others who had first seized the mules. I saw them carry off four men who had been hit. They carried off about fourteen mules altogether, fie., about five more than they had got from me. I saw no other mules anywhere in the neigh bourhood. A short time after they had gone off I was joined by you. No. 561. Sh' W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 10.) Sir, Tehran, January 22, 1913. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the four weeks ending this day. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 561. Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending January 22, 1913. Tehran. The Cabinet. —After considerable difficulty and frequent delays Ala-es-Sultaneh has at length succeeded in forming a Ministry. His Cabinet, which is composed as follows, was presented to the Shah on the 18th January -Prime Minister, Ala-es-Sultaneli. Minister of the Interior, Ain-ed-Dowleh. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vossuk-ecl-Dowleh. Minister of War, Mustauti-nl-Mamalek. Minister of Finance, Kawam-es-Sultaneh. Minister of Commerce, AIotamin-ul-Mnlk. Minister of Education, Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Minister of Justice, Momtaz-ed-Dowleh. Minister of Posts, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh. The Regent signified his approval by telegraph during the week. The Treasurer-General. —M. Mornard was made the object of an unruly demonstration on the 24th December. Being summoned by telephone to the house of the Prime Minister, he found himself surrounded by a crowd of menacing Bakhtiaris who demanded the settlement of their arrears of pay. Not content with commination, the Bakhtiaris assaulted M. Mornard’s personal servants. The matter was, with the aid of the two legations, satisfactorily arranged. The Police. —A general strike of the police was declared on the 17th January. Some disturbance ensued as a result of an attempt by the strikers to force the gendarmes to join their ranks. A sum of money was subsequently paid to them on account of their arrears of salary. The Electoral Law. —The Electoral Law Committee has decided that to possess a vote a man must have vested interests to the value of 100 L and pay a tax of 10 s. a-year. Herr Haase, German military instructor to the Persian Government, arrived from Europe on the 31st December with war material, including several Maxims ior the gendarmerie. „ , A contract has been signed with Khustarian for a service of motor cars on tire Resht-Tehran road. It is expected that the service will be inaugurated m six months. Russian troops now quartered in the governor’s house number 250 men with 4 Resht. Peace has temporarily been restored in the Talesh district. Astrabad. Salar-ed-Dowleh returned to Khoja Nefas about the 12th January. Seistan. Major Prideaux, His Majesty’s consul, arrived on the 26th November. An agitation has been in progress at Birjand against the revenue o and has been employing the scum of Birjand as his orhcia s. Kerman. Shiraz. with ~ ^ i • i i caravan of arms and ammunition which have arr lived at Bushire from Europe for the 2 H [1340]gendarmerie. His efforts appear to have been unsuccessful. Major Siefvert has, however, decided not to attempt to bring up the caravan for the present. Several road robberies are reported from Kazerun, and the road guards at Tangi Turkan are still extorting heavy tolls from passing caravans, tampering with the loads, and molesting travellers. On the 22nd December, Mohammed Ali Khan Kashkuli attacked and took a village near Kazerun. In the fighting which took place about thirty men were killed on both sides. Ispahan. * Sardar-i-Zaffar left for Tehran and Europe on the 29th December, and Amir-i- Jang (a son of Sardar Assad) took up the Governorship in the absence of Sardar Ashj ’a. There has been a marked improvement during the past month in the condition of the town. Contributions have been coming in to the Revenue Administration in a satisfactory manner, and excellent relations exist between the deputy governor and the financial agent. Caravans have been passing on the Ispahan-Shiraz road. The present safe conditions may however be attributed to the inclement weather recently experienced, which has driven the marauding bands off the road. Reports from Abadeh show that the Governor-General of Ears is in negotiation with the Boir Ahmedi chiefs, who came into that town with a view to concluding an arrangement with them for the patrolling of a portion of the road between Abadeh and Aminabad. Yezd. The expedition sent against Marvas appears to have met with little success. Two hundred reinforcements left for the district on the 7th January. The acting British consul reports that a feature of the past year has been the scarcity of caravans arriving from Bunder-Abbas. Merchandise from the north is gradually replacing British goods in the market. Kermanshah. The Sinjabi headman, Samsam-ul-Mamalek, has for long been engaged in cementing his alliances with the local tribes through marriage and intrigue to complete a confederation of all the Kermanshah tribes against the Kalhurs. The confederation in question was started early last year, and has since exercised a con siderable influence on the trend of local politics. It would now appear that the allied tribes consider themselves strong enough to commence hostilities, and His Majesty’s consul is of opinion that the Kalhurs will be unable to resist their forces. Samsam-ul- Mamalek has associated several notorious outlaws with the league, among whom one Mahmud Khan, Governor of Bisitun, upon whose establishment on the Bagdad road, in the event of the victory of the Sinjabis, Mr. McDouall looks with apprehension. Farman Farma remains in the town, but repudiates all the responsibilities of an official position there. The roads on all sides are very unsafe and little merchandise is being forwarded. The policing of the Hamadan road has been entrusted to the Kakawand tribe, the most notorious brigands in Kurdistan. Bushire. Early in November the Kalantar of Bushire, who throughout his ten years’ tenure of the office has shown himself continuously obstructive and hostile to British interests, was arrested by the Governor-General. An agitation for his release was started by his supporters, and, when intrigue failed, two armed parties were sent out to entrench themselves on the Shiraz road outside Bushire. They there held up all traffic for several days. As a spread of these disturbances was feared, His Majesty’s consul- general proposed to His Majesty’s Minister that British troops should be used to clear the road. In the meantime, however, the governor’s men succeeded in cutting the insurgents off from their supplies and in inducing them to Avithdraw. Ahwaz. Reports fiom Behbehan show that beyond collecting large sums of money from the town Amir-i-Mujahid has accomplished nothing. His Majesty’s consul states307 that it cannot now be hoped that he will gain any control over the Knhgelui tribe. Difficulties have been created by an attempt of his Excellency to get possession of the revenues of the Lirawi districts which are not under his jurisdiction. The Sheikh of Mohammerah has, as a consequence, threatened to withdraw his support from the Amir. Mohammerah. Amir Khan, a British Indian subject, has been appointed inspector of finance for Arabistan, and arrives from Tehran at the end of November. No. 562. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 10.) Sir, Tehran, January 22, 1913. I HAVE the honour to report the following movements of Russian troops during the month as recorded by His Majesty’s acting vice-consul at Resht:— On the 8 th January, 100 Russian infantry of the Shemaskinski regiment arrived at Resht from Kazvin and left Enzeli on the following day for Russia. On the 14th January, 300 Russian infantry arrived at Resht from Russia and left for Kazvin on the 15th January with a further 100 men who had arrived at Enzeli on the 15th January. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. No. 563. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received February 10.) ^ Tehran, February 10, 1913. THE Government is becoming very hard pressed for money. Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed to me earnest hope of the Cabinet that you will use your good offices once more with the Russian Government to induce them to make a generous advance in return for very great sacrifice made in granting Julfa-Tabriz Railway concession. His Excellency hopes that His Majesty’s Government will not delay their promised advance, as the. Government counts with confidence upon their good-will. No. 564. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey—(Received February 10.) (Telegraphic.) 10, 1913. MY telegram of the 21 st January. . , , , The arrangement respecting Salar-ed-Dowleh has not been carried out, because the new Cabinet, when they took office, decided that so dangerous an intriguer as the Prince should not be allowed to reside at Tehran m present circumstances After muc discussion it was decided, at the suggestion of the Russian Government th^ he shou be sent to Ghilan as governor of that province. Meanwhile Salar put himself at t head of a force and left Astrabad on a pillaging expedition, and is believed now to b marching on Meshed, having arrived at Sabzawar, on the road to that place The Government have sent a force m pursuit of him, and are inclined to levok appointment to Ghilan, on the ground that he has again taken up arms against them. No. 565. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.— (Received February 10.) , v x Tehran, February 10, 1913. TOE Cabinet have reopened the question of a small army. It is considered that the Central Government cannot make itself felt m the provinces without sue i a [1340] 2 H 2behind it. For the present it is only proposed to create a force of^ about 6,000 or 7,000 men. Nine foreign officers will be required as instructors. The Government would prefer Swedish officers, so as to make the army and gendarmerie more homogeneous, but they understand that there would be difficulty in obtaining more officers than will be wanted for the gendarmerie. No. 566. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 11.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 11, 1913. I HAVE obtained the following information respecting the concession for the Julfa-Tabriz Railway, and I believe it to be substantially correct. The concession is for seventy-five years. Persian Government have the option to purchase after thirty-five years. The construction is undertaken by concessionnaire at his own risk of loss, there being no financial guarantee on the part of either Russian or Persian Government. It is a conversion of the former road concession, which had lapsed, and as such conveys the right to work all petroleum and coal mines within 40 miles of the line on each side. Benefit of Persian Government is as follows :— 1 . Equal participation in profits of railway, after payment of 7 per cent, on the invested capital. 2 . 15 per cent, of the net profits from the mines on State lands situated as described above. The concession includes the right to construct an extension of the line to the northern end of Lake Urmia, and gives the company a preference to construct a railway between Kazvin and Tabriz on equal terms with those which any other company may offer in the future. Further, it carries with it a renewal of the old road concession under certain conditions in regard to the period of construction. No right to establish preferential rates in favour of trade is conferred. No. 567. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 11, 1913. YOU will have seen from St. Petersburgh telegram of the 8 th February, repeated to you, that Russian Government have agreed to advance 200 , 000 L to Persia. I am approaching the Treasury with a view to an immediate advance of a similar amount by His Majesty’s Government. Meanwhile you should consult with the Russian Minister as to the question of security, interest, and eventual repayment of the advance, and let me have your views by telegraph with as little delay as possible. You understand, of course, that this advance will be quite distinct from that to be granted for the purpose of Fars, as to which separate instructions will be sent to you. No. 568. Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 12, 1913. MY telegram of 30th January. You are authorised to inform Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government are most anxious to assist them to restore order in Fars by means of the gendarmerie, and are prepared to contribute to the financing of the administration, apart from their contribution to an advance on account of the loan, on the following conditions : 1 . That the conditions laid down in paragraph 2 of your telegram of 10 th December are observed. 2 . That, subject to any observation you may have to offer, the gendarmerie budget.I [ 1 ■ 309 should be drawn up by Swedish commanding officer at Shiraz, and agreed to by His Majesty’s consul and the financial agent in consultation, and, when this is done, that all actual payments should be made by the Swedish commander. 3. That all purchases for the gendarmerie should be put up to open tender. 4. That proper security and interest can be arranged. Can some arrangement be made to secure this separate advance on the revenue of the province (see your telegram of 15th January, paragraph 2 ), and what can be done about interest ? I should be glad to have your final opinion as to what sum monthly will be sufficient to ensure the proper organisation and gradual increase of the gendarmerie force, as well as the amount of the contribution which will be required for ordinary administrative purposes by the Governor-General. We presume that 8 , 000 i. a-month would suffice for all purposes. No. 569. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 14.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, February 14, 1913. THE Cabinet have addressed several telegrams to the Regent urging him to return to Persia, but his answers have been evasive and undecided. No. 570. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received February 14.) (Telegraphic.) $£. Petersburgh, February 14, 1913 ; MINISTER for Foreign Afiairs hears from representative of financial Russian group at Paris that moment is favourable for commencing negotiations with regard to large Persian loan. His Excellency therefore hopes that you will induce British group to send a representative to Paris. No. 571. Foreign Office to India Office. gj r Foreign Office, Febiruary 14, 1913. WITH reference to previous correspondence regarding the need for Great Britain and Russia to make a further pecuniary advance to the Persian Government before any big loan can be made by financiers connected with the Societe d Etudes ot tne Trans-Persian Railway, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to state that His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh has now informed him in a telegram of which a copy is enclosed* that the Russian Government are now prepared to make a joint advance to Persia of 400,0001. It is therefore necessary for His Majesty’s Government to provide then shaie ot the advance, viz, 200,0001, the appropriation of which sum for the purpose has, as your department are aware, been sanctioned by the decision of the Cabinet. In view of the urgency of the matter, I am to express Sir E. Grey s jiope that the Marquess of Crewe will concur in his view that the British moiety should also be paid forthwith and that in this case his Lordship will agree that half the British share of the advance shall be defrayed from Indian revenues, and will give directions that 100 , 0001 . shall accordingly be held ready for immediate payment to the 1 ersian G ° Ve i am also to express the hope that his Lordship will agree to advance from Indian funds one-half (50,0001.) of the extra 100 , 000 /. which it has been decided to advance in monthly payments of 8 , 000 /. solely for the purpose of restoring order m the south * No. 556.of Persia, and thus of avoiding the necessity of dispatching any of His Majesty’s forces for that purpose, a course which would appear to he the only and far more costly alternative. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. No. 572. Foreign Office to Treasury. gi r; Foreign Offce February 15, 1913. AS the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury are no doubt aware, the question of making a substantial advance to the Persian Government jointly with the Russian Government has engaged the attention of the Cabinet, who decided that if and when the Russian Government were prepared to proceed His Majesty’s Government would do likewise, in order to enable the Persian Government to carry on the adminis tration pending the eventual issue of a loan by certain financial houses connected with the Societe d’Etudes of the Trans-Persian Railway. His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh has now reported that he has been informed by the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that his Government are prepared to advance a sum of 200,0001 to the Persian Government, and Secretary Sir E. Grey is accordingly desirous to give effect to the decision of the Cabinet to make a similar advance at the earliest possible moment; and I am to express the hope that in the circumstances their Lordships will be able forthwith to place at his disposal a moiety of the 200 , 000 Z., the other half to be paid by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India in Council. I am further to call their Lordship’s special attention to the condition of Southern Persia, which is a matter of special and pressing concern to His Majesty’s Government and to the Government of India. Their Lordships are doubtless aware that in 1911 Mr. Smart, acting British consul at Shiraz, when returning to his post with an escort of 100 men, was attacked and wounded by tribesmen on the Shiraz road. For some days it was doubtful whether he or the British Indian force which was sent to his succour would be able to return to Shiraz, and the circumstances of the outrage seemed to point to the necessity of sending a military expedition of several thousand men to punish the tribesmen and keep the roads open. Sir E. Grey was opposed to this course, as, in his opinion, it is a policy which might lead to the permanent occupation of Southern Persia and to the partition of the country, and involve His Majesty’s Government in very heavy expenditure. Events disproved the exaggerated fears which were at first entertained, and Mr. Smart and the British detachment having reached Shiraz in safety, it was eventually agreed that His Majesty’s Government should accept the assurance offered by the Persian Government and trust to their efforts and to the organisation of the gendarmerie under Swedish officers for the restoration of order. Since that date the gendarmerie has made considerable progress, but it is not yet in a position to make its influence felt. According to the reports of His Majesty’s consular officers, the southern trade routes are practically closed, to the great detriment of British trade, imports accumulating in the ports without the possibility of distribution. British travellers, including officers in His Majesty’s service, are unable to proceed along the road, and outrages of various kinds have been perpetrated on those who have been obliged to do so. A recent event of tragic significance, namely, the murder by tribesmen of Captain Eckford at Dastarjin, has recalled public attention to the need for taking serious steps to assist in the restoration of order in the south of Persia. The military occupation of the Bushire-Shiraz road, of Kazerun and of Shiraz is urgently advocated in many quarters as the only means by which order can be restored on the southern trade routes. This view has been expressed by Sir Walter Townley, and although Major O’Connor, His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, takes a less pessimistic view of the results which the Persian Government might achieve with His Majesty’s Government’s assistance, it is clear that he considers that there is but slender hope of improvement unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to take the matter seriously in hand without delay and to provide the provincial administration with sufficient funds for ensuring themaintenance and development of the gendarmerie force on present lines as well as to enable the Governor-General to meet ordinary expenses of administration. His Majesty’s Government, who have for some time past been faced with the choice of two alternatives, having made up their minds in favour of the course which appears to commit them least, must not hesitate to take the consequence of their decision, which will involve the loan before the 21 st March of 100,0001. at least to he earmarked for the south in addition to the 200 , 000 Z. for general purposes. Sir E. Grey is, as you will perceive from his telegram to Sir W. Townley of the 12 th instant, enquiring wdiat sort of security can be given for this loan, and has suggested the provincial revenues; but he is prepared for an unsatisfactory reply, and although he has little doubt that it will be possible eventually to recover the sum advanced to the Persian Government, he is of opinion that His Majesty’s Government must on this occasion not enquire too closely into the nature of the security, but devote their attention to the proper control of its expenditure. The manner in which they hope to secure this is described in Sir W. Townley’s‘telegram of the 10 th December last and the above-mentioned telegram to him of the 12 th instant. Sir E. Grey trusts that their Lordships will appreciate the reasons which have led him to the conclusions advanced in this letter, and he is convinced that, if the present state of anarchy is allowed to continue, matters will go from bad to worse, and it will become impossible for His Majesty’s Government to resist the despatch of an important military expedition to Southern Persia, with all its possible consequences. He considers that the only means of averting this necessity is by making sacrifices to maintain the authority of the Persian Government, and he is therefore reluctantly compelled to ask the Lords Commissioners to sanction with as little delay as possible the advances for which he is now applying.
