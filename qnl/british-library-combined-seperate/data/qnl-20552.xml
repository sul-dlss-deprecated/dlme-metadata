The following enclosures are included with Kemball's letter:1. A letter (folios 364-66) from William Taylour Thomson, His Majesty's Charge D'Affairs at the Court of Persia, Tehran to Kemball, dated 12 July 1853, in which Thomson assesses the merits and drawbacks of leniency in the fines to be charged against the owner of the slave vessel, in consideration that the owner had invested in his slaves before the slave trade Order was passed in December 1852. Thomson alludes to private correspondence exchanged between himself and Kemball, relating to a proposed incentive for the Persian slave trade suppression commissioner Meerza Mahmood Khan;2. Letter no.235 of 1853 (folios 367-68) from Kemball to Thomson, dated 15 August 1853, in which Kemball reports that the fine for the slave traders has been set at 250 Tomans. Kemball also discusses further the proposals for financial incentives for Meerza Mahmood Khan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x000062#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
