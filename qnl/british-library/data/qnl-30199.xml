The note encloses ten lists detailing the administrative reorganisation of Persia [Iran] according to information supplied by the Iranian Ministry of the Interior. Each list represents an ustan [ostān], or province, with two further subheadings representing further subdivisions of each ustan (into shahristan [šahrestân] and bakhsh). Note that there is no material in the file relating to judicial matters, as the title erroneously suggests.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iran, Ministry of the Interior</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Administrative reform</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000064#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
