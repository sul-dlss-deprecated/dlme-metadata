Major Pridoauac used to suffer in the cold weather. In March we all were victims of colds or neuralgia, and Major -\nox*B serious illness was not improbably caused by chill# K iro places are, I hoar, being put into tho Consulate at Bund r /ibbaa.# i cannot believo that they are less necessa ry here.# 4. If they are sanctioned it would be convenient if the sanction could be communicated as soon as possible, as the hot weather is the time in which to get work done in Bahrein, and if they are not sanctioned I shall want time in order to make what arrangements I can for myself before next cold weather, so an early re-oly in either case would be conve nient# It would be useless for me to attempt now to give any estimate of the probable cost, as I understand from your letter Mo. 2290 dated 24th October 1907 that in such oases Government require rormrise a report from the Assistant Engineer in the Gulf, and in any case I should like to discuss the question with him before deciding precisely hoi# the work should be carried out. I incline to think that the best form of fireplace would be that of a stove to burn coal T?hich would stand inside the room. Guch stoves are, I think, comnon in America# The rooms here are largo and draughty and fuel is costly, and I tend to think that ordinary fire places would be expensive an.! ineffective in operation.Pro vision jould in my opinion be required for the Drawing Hoom, Dining Room and l becl room upotaire; and downstairs, for the three officoe of all of which the floors are very dasap in winter. 6* In regard to (b). The whole roof is in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition* 'hen the Agency was built there ■aas a scarcity in the Gulf of chandals (rafters) and apparent ly only tiiin and inferior ones could be obtained. This mir-. fortune was aggravated by the fact that the width of the rooms and the verandahs had been fixed so great that only first class chandals would have been adequate for the strain entailed by the load and the span* The result is that all tne roofs have sagged in varying degrees. This is has two results: ^^ b ^^ impossible to keep the roof in proper re pair because to add fresh layers of mud or gatch, as is usually done, only accentuates the mischief and makes the roofs unsafe. S. Hollows are formed on the surface of the roofs in which the rains collect and remain till it has filtered through the craclred and defective siibstance of the roof. Endeavours are of course made to sweep this water off, but tills oper- ation is oad for the roof and is useless until the rain has ceased. The general result is that the roof of every room and venrandah in the upper story leaks. Then there is heavy rain the dining room is quite uninhabitable. The after effects of this dampness introduced into the building have already been referred to. 7. Petty repairs stopping up cracks and making minor improvements I am going to attempt. But to undertake any general repair with the funds available would as I have already explained probably only mean finally wrecking the roof. In several places the verandah roofs are already dangerous, and yesterday without any provocation a chandal broke in my bed-room.All the roof's will in ooureQ of time bo in the erime state, and it is obviously dangerous to tamper with them by increasing the load to which they are subjected. 8« For the whole of the upper roofs there are only two remedies (and in this I have the support of I'ajor Knox's opinion)s they must be reconstructed either on a new principle and by introducing cross beans to break the spans ? or by using xkM fresh materialj or they must be ropairrd suxficiontly to hold out as they are and a new r-,in-proof roof be constructed over the top of the whole, b^o^ing of course entirely on the masonry of the building, Either of those, renedies is by its cost put entirely be yond the scope of the annual Repair Allowance of KslOOO/* rath regard to (c). The ground on which the Agency and its dependencies stand is barely above high water level and is by nature damp* The material of buildings is of a highly absorbent nature* There is further no proper sys— tern of drainage of the Agency grounds, and when heavy rain falls large sheets of standing water are left until they are gradually absorbed by the ground. In due course this water is drawn up by the buildings, the floors of the ground floor become damp and the damp spreads up all the walls to a hight of 4 or 5 feet inside and outside alike. Apart from the probable Effects of this phenomenon in the hygenic sphere, its obvious effects are that no ordinary plaster will hold properly on the lower parts of the walls and the mortar tends to rot out of the masonry which is of a very rough character. 10* I have no definite recomnendations to make in re gard to this question. The fault may be unavoidable or it may be traceable to the same causes as the defectiveness of the roof, via an unwiee economy in the first instance. This is another matter which it is impossible to deal with adequately with the funds available, and patching seems to me to be a mere throwing away of money into a bog. The subject is one on which the Assistant Engineera private living room and public reception room * In this it hao been the custom to receive all native visitors of consideration, whether paying complimantary visits or com- tng on business# The possible rersult any day is tliat the i ooji has at one and. tli© saise raosiont to serve as a sittin- room for the Political Agent's wijfe, a reception roois for Arabs and Persians on pleasure or business .and the reception roos for European visitors of either sex* This actually occurred on several occasions irhen I was here with Major Knox, and I cannot help thinking that it is highly Inconvenient and undesirable, no loss from the native than from the European point of vieTT# I do not think that Cheikh Ssa in the least relished having ladies in the room when he called on Major Mnox» I am very strongly of opinion that there should be an additional sitting roo© to which neither Suropoans nor natives would feel insulted by being asked to coae, and which would secure the Political Agent's wife, when he has onej in euf/ways having one place or another besides the bed-room iThore she could sit or work without the possibility of having natives shown in on her at any moment• 15t In this case again, it seems unnecessary for me to submit any definite proposals until I have had an opportunity of talking over the possibilities of the case with the Assistant Engineer, should you see fit to require him to report on the questions I hove raised# I will take credit for having omitted to mention 100 lesser matters several of which have been the subject of considerable correspondence# These I hope to be able to carry out without further troubling you or Government* 16# I may, however, perhaps venture to ask one further question, and that is whether Government would feel disposed to provide this Agency with a tennis-court* Bahrein is the worst place I have yet met with as re gards the resources it supplies for ordinary recreation and exercise, and recreation and exercise are certainly no lessnecessary to health here than elsewhere, Bo provision whatever to meet this want has been made for, or by, the Agency. I an endeavouring now to get a lam-tennis court constructed, but I would submit that I have already built one (in Ahwas) at considerable expense, Tor which I asked and received no asoistancea,© \ % t 1 &amp; ' V .

Of 1913 POLITICAL ASENOy, BAHREIN Prom Major A,P» Trevor, Political Agent, Bahrein To Lieut-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E,, O.S.I*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. * Dated Bahrein, the 8th March 191:5 Sir I have the honour to refer to the correapondenoe ending with your letter No* 654 dated S5th February 1913 regarding the proposal to rebuild the Agency here and to build tiharters for the clerks. The Assistant Engineer P.W.D» Persian Gulf Sub-Division has now visited Bahrein and drawn up, in consultation with rae, plans of the new buildings and a general plan arranging the new build ings on the ground available* These plans he will no doubt sub mit to you at an early date. It will thus be possible, if necessary, to take the scheme in sections and if necessary build by degrees. The question of the rebuilding of the Agency has been dealt with in detail by my predecessor in his letter No. 368 dated 26th May 1911, and it is unnecessary for me to enlarge on it again. It is sufficient to say that I endorse Captain Lorimer^ remarks about the inconvenience and bad condition of the exist ing house, which is most unpleasant to live in during the cold weather as all the rooms are damp from the leakage of the last fall of rain* I venture therefore to urge that the scheme may be taken up as a whole and sanctioned as soon as possible. It is possible however that want of funds or some other cause may postpone the possibility of the general scheme being sanc tioned; if this is so I venture to urge most strongly that the proposed new clerks' quarters may be sanctioned and built asaoon aa possible together with a compound wall round the new piece of ground to the west of the Agency. This can be done without interfering with the general scheme; in fact the Clerks 1 quarters can be built at^once as part of the general scheme, v /hich can be carried out later# The necessity of quarters for the clerks here has long been recognised and a piece of ground was shown as 'reserved for Clerks* quarters 11 1 by Major (then Captain) Prideaux in the plan submitted with his letter No» 36 dated 11th February 1905• Since then the question has more than once cropped up and has been dealt with in detail by Captain Lorimer in his letter Wo. 530 dated 8th August 1911, and I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the matter again* It is sufficient to say that only wretched insanitary houses can be obtained here, and these at a prohibitive rent, and that there seems no prospect of any suitable houses ever being built. For the above reasons I venture to urge that, whether the whole scheme is sanctioned or not,. - and I sincerely hope it will be - the clerks• quarters may be sanctioned and built with as little delay as possible, and at the same time a grant be made for enclosing the piece of ground recently pre sented to the Agency by Sheikh Isa.

With reference to letter No. 3055 dated November ^3rd 1912, from your First Assistant , I have the honour to send you herewith Plans and a Plinth Area Estimate for a new Political Agency' at Bahrein. 2. The Estimate amounts to Rs.1,55,000/- 3. The various designs, together with the site plan, have the approvai of the Political Agent at Bahrein; indeed they were drawn up in consul ta i, ion with him. ^ have attached Hereto a brief description of/the buildings; with some rematks as to th&amp;ir purno- e and construction.The Poli tical Ape ncv Tho proposed Agency is a doubie-storied house, the rooms being arranged round a central courtyard. The pian of the Building, more particularly that of the first i floor has to some extent been modelled after the Political Agency at Muscat; a house by common consent, one of the most confortab±e, and most suitable to the Climate, in the Guxf. The front entrance opens into ajiarre Hali, giving access to the Courtyard and to the iain staircase. The rest of the front of the building is occupied by a reception room for Arabs, and the Political ^ g e n t * ^ private ofiice. On either side of the courtyard are servants' rooms and store rooms; whiie the back of the house has a smite of rooms for the occupation of a ciass of visitor whom the Political ^gent cannot wen ent.r.ain. Such visitors are not infrequent in Bahrein, and must be provided for. A separate staircase is designed for the use of servants, and two small spiral stairs for sweepers. The living rooms proper are on the first floor and call for little comment. The accommodation for guests/consists of one large bed room with dressing room and two bath rooms together with a smal± bed room and bathroom. The interior verandah on the firt floor is intended to be fitted with loiding grazed shutters. These would be ciosed in the winter, thus rendering every room on the firtt fioor accessible without going out into a cold open verandah. iJ} u&gt;% For abuut haif the width of the front of the huii( ; ^inp• the verandah has been widened uut to 21 feet, thus forming a convenient open spact; lor use in the sunner months • From the inner ver ndah a stairs gives access to the roof The servants quarters o.nd stables are similar to those in the present Agency. They together with the Agency House, are situated in a senarate compound. O ffic es and Court Room The offices and Court Room, together with the Majiiss room, form a separate building. The Political Agent did not wish these rooms 10 be placed on the ground fioor of the Agency itseif, as the crowds of neopo-e, necessarily attendant when the Majiiss and Court are sitting, would seriousiy detract from the nrivacy and quiet of the house; as nas been the case in the present building. Sepoys' Line s The Sbpoys' Lines provide the same accommodation as the existing lines. A bathing enclosure has been added. This was asked for by the Sepoys themselves, and seems a reasona- bie demand. C^erKs Quarte rs. The cierKs quarters have accommodation on a similar scaie to that now given to the Postmaster at Bahrein. The ci-erks were shown the man and appeared to think the quarters as designed wou.td be comfortabxe and convenient. En tran ce a_h e ihe mam gate is not dissimilar to the nresent one. The.Guard room and the ceils are pxaced on either side of entrance. This has been found a convenient arranfren&amp;nt as it enables the sentry on duty at the gate to keep an eve on the prisoners without weaving his beat.Site pi an The buildings have been arranged with the Maj±iss building as a central feature. To the north front of it is ruaced the Flagstaff; while tne entrance p-ate is directiy opposite to the south front. A road has been d ^anned running the T 'hoie j-ength of'the sea front ofthe site. To the east of the Maj- iiss building is ohe Agency; to the west, the Clerks Quarters and Sepoys Lines. The general effect should be dignified and imposinpr; marlc- ediy in contrast to the crowded squalor of the iocai buiid*. ings on either side of the site. It wix± be noticed that the proposed Post Office and Cierks Quarters are situated on the recently acquired lahd. It wiii thus be possible to proceed with their construction at once. They wixi not interfere with the existing buildings, and shouid the scheme now proposed be sanctioned in its entirety they wii± then form Dart of it. Cons truct ion Labour is very difiicuit to obtain /Bahrein, and it is very expensive. Masons, and poor workmen at that, recently asked as much as Rs.4/- a davf rom the Political Agent. This is more thu.n four times the usual Day of a. mason in the Bom bay Presidency. It /ouid be cheaper to imoort dl labour from India; while the work wouid be incomparably better th^n the best that can be done by iocai labour. I have not thought it necessary at this stare to ^nter into detailed spicifications; but, I think, for the above- stated reasons, that the work should be specified in accord ance with Indian practice, and of the sane standard as that usu^ny adopted in India for buildings of similar importance.3 ll ' R.S.V POLITICAL AOSIOT, ^ BAHHEtH (PERSIAN O0U); Srd July 19IS.

I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No, 1006, dated the 27th March 1913, regarding the cons- truction of Agency buildings and a ?ost Office at Bahrein. You lay stress on the urgency of providing suitable quarters for the clerks of the Agency and of commencing work thfereon as soon as possible. The Government of India recognise the necessity for the provision of Jhese quarters, but are of opinion that the accommodation proposed for the clerks is out of proportion to 4 rooms, 12* 10' with subsidiary rooms I their salary and renuirements. It appears to the Government of India that a sum of Es 15,000 would be amply sufficient to provide ouarters of a suitable description, taking into consideration the high rates that prevail in the Persian Gulf. 5. I am, therefore, to convey administrative^ sanction to the construction of clerks quarters at a cost of Rs 15,000 and to request that this amount should not be exceeded. 4.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to your office endorsement !To.S869 dated 20th September 1913, forwarding a copy of a letter ( T To.l942 Est-B, dated 23rd August 1913) from the ^eputy Soosjetary to the Government of India in the Foreign department giving sanction to the expenditure of Hs.15 ,000/- on quarters for the clerks of this Ajaency. I respectfullv beg to point out that the principal reason why the original desi^m for the quarters gave 1 -oo~ deal of accominodation was to provide buildings with an upper tor ^y. As you are aware, in the Persian uulf ports everyone who can possibly affora it resides in a house with an upper storey ^and nearly all 'pukka 11 houses are so built. The reason of this is that during the hot moist weather^repailinp in the summer the ground floor is practically uninhabitable unless it is on a very high plinth, ^n additon to this, I would renarh that the Agency cite here is ri ^ht on the sea shore and only a few feet above high water level; the ground is partly reclaimed Ian' and the soil is sand and rubbish, there beinrr no rook above hi&lt;*h water level. The consequence of this is that the ground floor of the Agency and subsidiary buildings is excessively damp and unhealthyunhealthy • I think it 1 oan be entirely kept out * of the new buildings or b: expense# v or these reanor Ingo my be sanctioned foij it would I presiime be neoe Hs.15 ,000/-. In conoluoion I the same reasons as set fo built for the Agency cleric that the clerics here may h I thinh experience at l-Xvaoi much better health now and they have been ccnfortably Your ^ol H.H.M,unhealthy • I think it is extremely doubtful if this danp oan be entirely kept out by waterproof courses in the walls of the new buildings or by any other means excerit at front expense. For these reasons I ^o urge that 2 storie -l build ings may be sanctioned for the clerks' quarters, in which case, it would I presume be neoeesary to increase the allotment of Hs. 15,000 A. In conclusion I venture to T ^oint out that for nuch the same reasons as set forth above ? two storied quarters were built for the Agency clerks at rr uscat, and to express the hope that trie clerks here may be treated with the same liberality. I think experience at Muscat has shewn that the clerks enjoy much better health now and are capable of bettor work since they have been comfortably housed* I have the honour to be.

(iii) the site- is water-logged, and (iv) the accommodation is unsatisfactory. On the information before them the Government of India are not nrenared to admit that a building which was constructed only about ten 'rears ago 1s beyond repair or that the defects mentioned above cannot be remedied. \ 3. It seems that the roof is carried by ^handals 1 (rafters) ?;hich are not sufiiciently strong ^or their span and hav consequently sagged to a considerable extent. This would account for the leaking, esnecial- iy if the roof is a flat one. If the walls are sound ^ - ■ e p g''■I there should be no difiiculty in re-roofinr the building. In regard to (ii) above, the defect could presumably be removed by the nrovision of stoves or fire-places. The site is said to be low-lying and to retain water in nools after rain. IJ eventless , it is proposed to erect the new buildings on the sane site, which is to be drained. The water logged conditions of the existing building night be innro- ved in the same manner. Drainage of the site would go far towards reducing the dampness o^ the walls, and it should then be possible to eradicate this defect completely by the introduction of a damp- proof course if the nature of the walls will admit of sucji treatment. But here a^ain the information available is of too vague a nature to admit of any definite opinion being formed. The only reference that has been made to the structure of the walls is that they are built of'highly absorbent material*. 4* In order to enable the Government o^ India to a arrive at/decision in the matter it will be necessary to furnish them with a, full and clear renort as to the practicability of remedying the defects in the Existing building and of adapting the accommodation by means ofadditions and alterations to meet actual requirements. The renort should be accomnanied by plans of the existing building, a descrintion o^ the' walls and of their condition the relative levels of the site and high tide, and the facilities that exist for draining the rround.il/ 1 To, No • 6 Of 1913« POLITIC Air A-H-TCY, BAHREIN« Dated tho 3.31 November 1013 • : Seth gf.f» Maharaj, Director of Guutoms, P.

Unfortunately no copy of your letter No.143 was ever sent to Government and I cannot help thinking therefore that in their own minds they look on the Post Office proposals and the Agency 4 buildings as interdependant and are waiting to give a decision in regard to the former until they get our reply to their letter No.2340 Est.B. of October 2nd 1913j(vide endorsement 3164 of 19th October 1913 to you).

I am opinion that it is quite impossible to construct suitable quarters for four clerks at Bahrain at a cost of Rs. 15000/-.

I am directed to refer to your letter No.3422,dated the 15th November 1913,in which you ask that the Government of India will be pleased to reconsider their decision limiting the cost of construction of quarters for the clerks of the Political Agency,Bahrain,to Rs.15,000/-. 2. The Government of India adhere to their opinion that it is unnecessary to give each clerk 4 rooms. They consider that it should be readily possible to provide suitable quarters for men on the salaries they draw for R3.l5,000/-. They can find no indication of any attempt by the Assistant Engineer to revise his original design and estimate or to effect the reduction directed in this Department letter No.1942,dated the 23^d August 1913. It is understood from your letter under reply that double-storied quarters are necessary owing to the water-logged conditions of the site which would render the lower storey,or half the accommodation,uninhabitable at certain seasons. But there would appear to be no reason why the objection to single-storied quarters should not be overcome by building on a high plinth,and by the provision of a homogeneous floor slab,composed of suitable damp resisting material,over the whole area of the building including the walls at plinth level. 3. On the evidence before them,the Government of India are not disposed to agree to any increase over the amount already sanctioned,and I am to request that an alternative design and estimate within that limit,for a single-storey building be submitted for their consideration./' 1 lOtjJ t o Xo- Z2 Z ^14, 4 AVt^VW 'XS c.

Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf Sub-Division. To. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e. February 19th 1914. 24th Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.5165 dated October 19th, 1913; with which you sent me a copy of letter No.2340 Sat-B dated October 2nd, 191.% from the Deputy Secre tary in the Foreign Department. 2. I will reply to the last-mentioned letter in detail. ' r ith re gard to the first and final paragraphs, I have attached to this a report on the building which I trust contains all the information which is needed. 5. With regard to the second paragraph; the last half of it would appear to have been written under a misaDDrehension. In the 5th. paragraph of my original renort I expressly stated that it was poss ible to remedy all the defects of the building, with the sxce'ption that little or nothing could be done to rrevent the rising of damp in the walls. I hold to t 1 is opinion and hope that this point has been made clearer in the attached report. 4. With regard to the third paragraph; there will of course he no difficulty in re-roofing the building, in providing fireplaces, or in ihereasing the accommodation. The site too can easily be drained of surface water. It is almost certain, however, that this will do little or nothing to improve the state of the walls. The wetness in these is due to the sea rather than the rain. The foundations of the building go down to hi.rrh tide level. The surface of the ground itself is only about(iotf \ ■ : ,0 .^ re e feet above high tide level. The aea at high tide oo^ee to yitMn 40 feet of the walls of the building, which, made as they ire of coral rock and mud, readily soak up moisture. I would lay stress on this point as Oaptain Lorimer, erroneously as I think, appears to have attributed the dampness of the walls to the rain. He was clearly mistaken. At this moment (15-1-14) the walls and floors are quite damp although there has been no rain to sr &gt;eak of. While on this point I might mention perhaps that the floors are not strictly speaking 'damp', as the word is usually understood, but wet. The floor matting has the actual appearance of havins; ha-1 water poured on it in places. 5. it would be very difficult and costly to introduce a damp-proof course into the walls. 'The mud in the lower part of the walls is wet and it would be dangerous to attempt to cut out masonry to -et the damp proof layer in. The walls too are very thick, which would add to the difficulty of the undertaking. I cannot recommend any such work being attempted. 6. My original report was intended to express the opinion, not that it was impossible to remedy the defects of tlis tmllftliv, hut that it would he had policy to attempt to do so. In suhmittinf the attached report as to the praoticahility of remedying these defects, I would apain state that I do not think, from an enpineerin^ noint of view, that repairing, adding to, and partially re -construotma: the house is likely, in the long run, to prove either economical or satisfactory. If, however, Government are not prepared to provide funds for the construction of a new building there is no alternative hut to endeavout to improve the present one. • I have stated in my report what I consider to he the best means of doing this; and I have endeavoured to make my suggestions practi cable, cheap, and in keeping with the economical standard of con- struotion adopted when the house was built. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd) P.H .E. Thownshend Lieut. R.13. Asst .Engineer Persian Gulf.■ic* REPORT ON THE BAHRAIN The foundation masonry is of coral rook in mid. This ooral, arhich is porous and deeply pitted, is laid in roufh courses, without any dressing. The masonry throughout the Agency is of the same nature The foundations are carried down 3 feet below the surface of the ground. The plinth level is 2 feet above ground. The plinth masonry is of coral roolr in mud, plastered outside with &lt;mtch. The ground floor throughout is earth filled and paved with porous local stone I- 1 - inches thick set in gutch. The stones are not dressed or out square but are laid in pieces of irregular size and ehape with joints ur) to inches wide. The superstructure masonry is of ooral rooh in mud, plastered inside and out with irutch. This 'gutch', which is always used in local buildings in the Persian Gulf for plaster, in an irrnure plaster of Paris, (Magnesium Sulphate) made by burning an earthy gypsum. It makes a very good plaster when protected from wet; but it Is course soluble in water, and rapidly blisters and disintegrates under the action of damp. The walls of the building are re -inforced in nlaoes with the trunks of date trees. The first floor is supported on rough round rafters, called 'Ohandals', of varying diameter, from 2 inches to 5 inches. On top of the rafters is a layer of date matting, somewhat similar to the chitai is use in India. This is covered with 1 inch of gutch nlaster which forms the flooring of the up-stairs rooms. The roof is precisely similar to the first floor. The upper part of the first floor verandah is filled,in nlacea, with painted deal wood sunshades. The up-staira verandahs are nro- vlded with locally made railings of i inch round iron set in painted by 2' deal wood frames. The drawing room, dlnin* room, and office have deal wood Planned ceilings. The doors and windows are of naka teak, locally made, fitted with brass furniture, and oilod. The door and window frames are of paka teak. The top surface of the roof is flat, and has been given a slifhtslope. The rain water runs from the roof into deal wood channels, from which it falls clear of the walls to the ground. The dimensions of the building and the sizes and arrangement of the rooms are shown in the attached plans. The site, as will be seen from the levels, is practically flat. There will be no diffi culty in filling up hollows and giving a slight slope to the surface of the ground, so as bo facilitate the running off of the surface ^ater. The four chief defects of the building are as follows: T A. The roof leaks. P, The ground floor is damp. C. The rooms are cold. D. The accommodation is insufficient. With regard to A . The roof can be made watertight by laying on it one thidmees of 5 D ly 'Ruber o id', with 6 inch overlap joints cemented down. In the verandahs where the chandals have sagged dably under the weight of the roof, thev should be re^lacei by stouter ones. In two of the bedrooms it will be necessary to strengthen the roof by placing Rolled Steel Beams across the sentres of the rooms, ani laying the existing chandals lengthways with the room. This will reduce the span supported by the chandals from 13 ft. 9 to 10 fee.• With regard to B . It would be impracticable to attempt to rut in damr-rrocf courses. The mud in the walls is wet and therefore aoes not rive sufficient adhesion to render it feasible to cut out masonrv on an extensive scale. The floors oould be relayed with Garlick'a Indian Patent Stone, 1 inoli thick. This is waterproof, and would effectually prevent the damp rising through the floors. The walls could be stripped and plastered inside and out, with cement plaster a , -i.-.t of 10 feei.above floor level. In places the walls are wet up to 8 feet above ^loor level, and the level of the water appears to be slov/ly rising. The cement plaster should contain 5$ of linseed oil to render it waterproof. The stones and joints should he well cleaned out to ^ive a Food key to the plaster. With regard to 0 . I thinV that the most satisfactory solution v. r ould be to provide fireplaces. These are required in the ainin.f? room, Drawinp- room, and in the Political Agent's Office. With reRard to D . In order to increase the accomniodation I recommend that the upstairs South verandah be roofed in, as it was apparently originally intended that it should bo. This will keep the sun off the South wall of the Dining room, rendering that room habitable in the hot weather; thus r^rovidin^ a suitable room to which a Political Agent's wife could retire when Arabs were being received in the Drawing room by the Political Arent. An additional bedroom can be made by demolishinp* the west stair case. Two main stair-cases are not necessary, and the western one hs has long been disused. A bathroom for the new bedroom could be made in the west veran dah, similar to the two existing bathroom. It will be necessary to modify the present arrangement of the bathrooms, as the access to them, from their respective oedrcoma, lies across the passage used by the sweeper. It would be oebter to build a narrow verandah outside the three bathrooms for the sw^ep^r, an arrangement that will make it possible to give better lighting to the bedrooms. The suggested alterations will be better understood from the attached drawing. A small store-room is necessary upstairs. It could easily be constructed by closing a portion of the verandah lying bo two n the Dining room and the Pantry; vide the attached plans.■ ter ■1^- Bahrein, Ist March 1914 Pleas© refer to '-our derai-offfoial of 18th February 1914, regarding Bahrein buildings. 1. post Office . The proposal for this wis of course in the first instance an entirely distinct matter, as it was raised by Prideaux in 1908, and fcbe cost wowld be met froin Post Office funds. At one time (November 1910) the matter got so far that the contractor actually arrived to build the new Post Office - but even in th9s© days the proposal had hung fire so long that everyone at Bahrein had forgotten all about it, and the site originally pro-posed had been built over and no other was avail- able. The Post Office proposal however frot mixed up with the other in 1918 and separate sanction to it was deferred on the strength of Sir Percy Cox f 3 letter Wo•2314 dated 22nd 3er&gt;tember 1912. When submitting my proposals last March my idea was that^ ' as we now had plenty of ground and could build the Clerks quar ters and Post Office as part of the new scheme whether the new Agency buildings wore sanctioned or not^tiae* the three things Post Office Captain R. L. Birdwood, I.A. First Assistant Residant B u s h i r epost office, Clerks quarters and Agency should he dealt with independently, and each carried out as sanctioned, without waiting for anything else on the site fixed on the General site plan referred to in ry letter No.144 dated Bth March 1013, I thought that possibly as the ^ost Office 'building had once been sanctioned and cash allotted it mirht fret through quiclrer than the other proposals especially the nev/ Arency ^uilding which I realized would take years. . I arn returning Townshend^ t &gt;lans and estimates for repairs —-a- i at once. I have si, Pried the plans to show that I armrove of the proposals* I suppose the desipns of Clerks quarters will come to me also - I su^pested to TSownshend that perhaps an upstairs office mipht be made for the Political Afent where the present East staircase is, and a new staircase made elsewhere - hut my suF ^estion came after he had imde out hiG planjand estimates so it is,I think best to drop it. It is sufficiently evident that Bahrein is to remain the Cinderella of the Agencies! vn y Clerks should not r.et the same style of quarters here as they have at Muscat and Bunder Abbas is a mystery, not to be dealt with logically.Copy of a letter No.780, dated 15th March iyi4, from the , secretary to the Government of India in the ' oreifii and Political Department , Delhi. it letter i:o . 2340-E£t .3 J of 0 End 1913, I 1 , Lth, tl , d ! , endorse the vie./s ex ressed by l a^or Trevor, and am ver^ j tvonply of oiiinio :! that a nev/ .agency at iiahr .in is . .n urgent necessity.

Major A .P .Trevor, C.I .E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN. ,7 TsC O «\ai) Docket Telegram. From-Knox, On Special Duty (In the absence of the Resident). To -Keyes, P.A.Bahrain. Reference my endorsement No.825, dated 18th March 1914. I forward herewith copy of Foreign letter ^o.l577-Est.B., dated the 13th July 1914. Firstly . It has been arranged that damp proof experiment is to be carried out before repairs generally are put in hand. The Assistant Engineer is awaiting arrival of material ordered for experiment. Secondly . Post Office. Please inform me what the position is in regard to question raised in paragraph 4 of Foreign 1 s letter now xorward 3° • ^ Dated, ecember 1914 u O Q ■ J ^ „ J edCopy of letter Ilo, 1577-Est.B. f dated 13th July 1914 from the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, to the Resident. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter 110 .788 dated 15th Karch 1914 with which you submit plans and estimates for alterations and repairs to the Bahrain Agency buildings in accordance with the request contained in the letter from the Government of India in this Department I 'to.B340- Est.B., dated the 2nd October 1913. 2. On the information before them and in view of the opinion reaffirmed by the Assistant Engineer in paragraph 3 of his letter 10.51 dated 19/24th February 1914, the Government of India are not convinced of the necessity for the reconstruction of the Agency buildings. They are, however, pleased to sanction an ex penditure of Rs.11090/- on estimates A .C. and D. received with your letter i.e. for repairing the roof, for the provision ifff fireplaces and for certain extra rooms and improvements. In regari to estimates 3, I am to observe that the Assistant Engineer makes no Drovision in the estimate lor a damp course, and states in his report that it is impossible to put one in because the walls are built of coral rock and mud, and the mud being wet does not give sufficient adhesion to render it possible to cut out masonry on an extensive scale. But it is not apparent to the Government of India how the building can ever be made damp -proof unless a damp proof course is provided. The provision of cement plaster to the walls will only prevent the damp from escaping up to the levol to which the cement is applied and it will rise above thatlivel. Though it nay not be possible to cut out the masonry on an ex tensive scale it may be possible to do so on a oaomparatively small scale. There seems to be no reason why the damp course should not be put in in small lengths for half the width ot the wall at a time and. if great care is taken in making the Joints between adjacent lengths, the result should be satisfactory. If it is found possible to insert an efficient damp course cement plaster will not be necessary on the inside of the walls, it willonly required on the outside where 'tiie walls are exposed ''to the rain. The provision made for cement plaster is Rs.5274/-. Most of this amount can probably he saved and the savings will in all likelihood more than suffice for the provision of an asphalte damp -proof course, 3. The Government of India therefore consider that an experimerC* should 'be made with the object of ascertaining the possibility of making the building damp-proof. This experiment can conveniently i be carried out in the Political Agents office room in which a damp course and the patent floor proposed should now be put down. The gutch plaster outside the building should be stopped at the damp course otherwise damp will rise in the plaster and the walls will appear damp on this account, ^articular attention should alsc be paid to external drainage which should be improved as far as possible. I am to convey sanction to an expenditure of Rs.lOOO/- on this experiment and to ask that a report of the result may be forwarded to the Government of India. 4. The decision to abandon the proposal to reconstruct the Agency revives the question of accommodation for the ^ost Office. I am in this connection to draw your attention to this Department letter So.976-EstB. , dated the 10th April 1 C J12, and to request, if the Political Agent at Bahrain still requires the room in the Agency which has hitherto been used as a ^ost Office that alter native proposals for the accommodation of. the office be submitted which will not involve the expenditure contemplated in 1912. 5.

As already requested in my telegram referred to above amounts aggregating Rs. 447-8-0 already drawn by you in February and March 1915 and any further sums that may have since been drawn should be refunded in your next cash accounts and you should submit your bills to Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf Division, for payment. 2. The vouchers for Rs. 447-8-0 received with your letter No. 433, dated ^Sth May 1915, are accordingly returned herewith for submission to the Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf Sub-Division, Bushire, for payment and refund of the amount charged in your accounts for February and March 1915. Copy of letter No. itfj-Est. B., dated the 13th July 1914, from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Departmenty to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 788, dated the 15th March 1914, with which you submit plans and estimates for alterations and lepaiis to the Bahrain x\gency Buildings in accordance with the request contained in the letter from the Government of India in this department No. 2340 Est-B., dated the 2nd October 1913- 2. On the information before them, and in view of the opinion reaffirmed by the Assistant Engineer in paragraph 3 of his letter No. 51, dated the I9th/24th February 1914, the Government of India are not convinced of the necessity for the reconstruction or the Agency Buildings. They are however pleased to sanction an expenditure of Rs. 11,090 on estimates A. C. and D received with your letter i. e., for repairing the roof, for the provision of fireplaces and for certain extra rooms and improvements. ^ In regard to estimate . am to observe that the Assistant Engineer makes no provision in the estimate tor a damp (? proof) course and states in his report that it is impossible to put one in_because the walls are built of coral rock and mud and the mud being wet does not give sufficient adhesive sea e. But it is not apparent to the Government of India how the buildings can ever e ma ^e ca!:n P proof unless a damp-proof course is provided. The provision of cement piaster to tne wa s will only prevent the damp from escaping upto the level to which the cement is applied am it will rise above that level. Though it may not be possible to cut out ie masonry on a, , extensive scale, it may be possible to do so on a comparative 7 sma sca ^ to be no reason why the damp (? proof) course should not be &lt; (? done) out in small lengths for half the width of the wall at a time and, if great care is taken in making the joints between the adjacent lengths, the result should be satisfactory. 1 is oun posbi e o insert an efficient damp (? proof) course cement plaster wi no e necessary on e insi cf the walls, it will only be required on the outside, where the walls are eX P 0S ^ d to ^ f,' 1 , The provision made for cement plaster is Rs. 5,274. 0 ^ ^ a!n Ul ? . 1 F 'i vi ir saved and the saving will in all likelihood more than suffice or 1^ provisi 1 damp-proof course, 3. The Government of India therefore consider that an with the object of ascertaining the possibility of making l e u )t r0( f m : n w hich a experiment can conveniently be carried out in the Po ltlca . t down The mitch Jnp {P proof) course and the patent floor proposed §1^ plaster outside the building should be s o PP ed a on this account. Particular attention will rise in the plaster and the wails will appear o am P . , , n0ss ib;e 1 am should also be paid to external drainage which shoul ^J^^iment and to ask' that a to convey sanction to an expenditure of Rs. 1,00 ■ report of the result may be forwarded to the Governmen o no2 4, The decision to abandon the proposal to reconstruct the Agency revives the duestion of accommodation for the post office. I am in this connection to draw your attention to this department letter No. 9 76-Est-B., dated the loth April 1912 and to request of the Political Agent at Bahrain (? to report whether he) still requires the room in the Agency which has &amp; hitherto been used as a post office and alternative proposals for the accommodation of the office be submitted which will not involve the expenditure contem- plated in 1912. 5. The plans received with your letter No. 1006, dated the 27th March 1913, and the plans and estimates received with your letter under reply are herewith returned. No. 523 of 1915.

In case of large works where the work-people are not e to be often removed from one class of work to another, lames of work-people should, if possible, be arranged rding to snb-heads of Estimate.

In case of labour employed on several works at one on or on a single work, where the workmen are lalle .frequently shifted from one sub-head to another, the ation sheet should be used for the purpose of abstracti U g ges on each sub-head of a work, it should be attached le Muster Roll when submitting the latter to the sional Office. ^ub-divisional Officers and Executive Engineers Id be most careful to see that the work is obtained mensurate with the labour charged for and should onally muster the men at irregular and unexpected fl, noting such check musters at foot of date concerned. The Muster Roll should be completed as regards Is, etc., immediately after the close of the period for A it is kept and the labourers paid as soon as possible.

In a carrying out the pro cess of damp-proofing the amount of dismantlement should be reduced as much as possible» In regard to the pillars there is no information available to show exactly what they support or whether each pillar can be relieved of its load, as ,for example, by struts on each side, during the process, but with care presumably the pillars can be treated in the same way as the walls. The advisability of adopting this method must, however, be left to the discretion of the Local Public Works officer. Should it prove impracticable to relieve the pillars of the superincumbent load while the work is being done it would be better to abandon their treatment in the same manner as the other portions of the building, and, as an alternative, to rake out the bed joints at or below floor level to a depth of 5 ^ inches and fill in with cement on each face of the pillar successively (not simultaneously ) . This would probably have a good result which would be increas ed if asphalte could be used instead of cement. Subject to these remarks the estimates, amounting to Bs.6433, are sanctioned. The expenditure should be met by reappropna- tion in the manner mentioned in paragraph of yourleuter under reply. 4.

T hb SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT op INDIA in the Foreign and Political Department, To T hb DEPUTY POLITICAL RESIDENT in thb PERSIAN GULF, BUSHIRE. (Copy to the Hon'ble the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, and to the Deputy Civil Commissioner, Basrah.) . ana to tbe Delhi, the I / November 1917. Sir, With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 495 dated the 13th March 1916, I am directed to state that, with the approval of His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, it has been decided to introduce the following revised arrangements for the execution of public works in the Persian Gulf with effect from the 1st April 1917 :—• (1) All Consulates, Agencies and stations in the Persian Gulf and the adjoining regions will be classified, for purposes of public works, into two categories : the accessible and the inaccessible. Bassidu, Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Bahrain, Kuwait, Maskat and Muhammarah will be included in the former category and Ahwaz, Kerman and Shiraz in the latter. (2) The office contract grant of every Agency and Consulate will provide in future for expenditure on petty repairs but for no other expenditure of a public works nature. This expenditure will be non-auditable (as in the case of all expenditure from an office contract grant) its amount being left to the discretion of the disbursing officer within the limits of the grant. The Public Works Department will not be concerned with the provision of funds on this account as they do not deal with petty repairs. (3) A central contract grant will be placed at the disposal of the Political Resident to cover expenditure on annual or ordinary repairs at all posts under his control. All expenditure from this grant, though restricted to public works purposes, will be non -auditable like office contract grants, and will be entirely at the disposal of the Political Resident who will be permitted, as in the case of office grants, to carry forward to the next financial year the unexpended balance from the central contract grant. (4) All public works expenditure outside the central contract grant, i.e., $.11 expenditure on original works and special repairs, will be subject to the ordinary rules of the Public Works Code, except in the inaccessible posts whereit will be non-auditable and where its entire control, within the sanctioned limit in each case, will he left to the local Political Officer. (5) The present Public Works Sub-division in the Persian Gulf will continue to form part of the Bombay Public Works Department; tbe Assistant Engineer in charge will, however, be given the full powers of an Executive Engineer in all respects and will be brought under the immediate control of the Superintending Engineer, Indus Eight Bank Division. ' (6) The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf will be empowered to approve administratively all new projects, the approximate cost of which does not exceed Rs. 1,600. Works in excess of this amount will require the sanction of the Secretary of State for India and application for the necessary sanction should be made to the Government of India in all such cases. (7) Final or technical sanction to estimates for works which have been administratively approved will be accorded by the Assistant Engineer, Persian Gulf Sub-division, the Superintending Engineer, Indus Right Bank Division, or the Government of Bombay, according to their respective powers of sanction in respect of ordinary Imperial Public Works. (8) All expenditure on public works in the Persian Gulf—so far as audit is retained—will be under the audit of the Accountant-General, Bombay, (9) These orders will apply only to Consular and strictly political buildings. 2. I am to enclose a statement showing the financial effect of these orders, and to request that proposals may now be submitted for the revision of the establishment of the Public Works Sub-division in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be. Sib, Tour most obedient servatnt, A. H. GRANT, Secretary to the Govt, of India, Ko. Est. B.
