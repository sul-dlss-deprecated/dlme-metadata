            with the Persian authorities at Sheraz [Shiraz], though the precise nature of this
            agreement is not outlined in the letter; a copy of this agreement has been sent to the
            Bombay Government for approval. It notes that Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā, Prince at Sheraz, seems
            intent on launching an expedition against Bahrain, in order that the island may once
            again come under Persian control. The letter notes that in the Resident's opinion,
            the Prince hopes to use such an expedition as an excuse to avoid being summoned to Court
            at Tehran, and the expense such a summons would incur. It also notes that the Resident
            believes that Persian control over Bahrain would be the best arrangement to ensure peace
            and stability in the Persian Gulf.Also outlined in the letter is the attention the Resident
            has paid to the Prince during his stay at Sheraz, and of the gifts presented to him by
            Persian authorities. It further notes the Resident's intention to return to Bushire
            via Bassidore [Bāsaʻīdū].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x00007d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
