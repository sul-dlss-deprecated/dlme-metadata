                           Garmsir, to haul down the red ensign. The officer was said to have accompanied the order with threats, and to have struck a British Indian clerk.The papers contain correspondence and memoranda from HM Minister, Tehran, the Foreign Office, and the India Office discussing what the British response to the incident should be, and recording the resulting diplomatic contacts over the affair with the Government of Iran.The papers indicate that the Iranian Government failed to express any regret over the incident, and that the British Government expressed official disappointment as a result.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Diplomatic protests</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Flags</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018d#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
