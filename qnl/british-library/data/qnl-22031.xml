Agency Bahrain fofr the year * Personnel. oif ^ 4-n .-.ot * ■ — ° h9 - olit i° a l Agency was held by the Indian ssistctiit Shan Sahib tt / ^ diq Raaaan until January 20th whan charge was taken over by Major C.iC.Raly, the present incumbent. The Indian Assistant proceeded o 9 leave in May and has since been transferred,the Political Agent being in charge of the duties in atsfcrti addition to his own, ? ?i?g -?. uler ot Bahrain and A1 IChalifeh family. in the latter part of I 92 0 relations with shaik Sir Rasa Bin AH had become extremely difficult and although they have,to some extent,since improved,are still unsatisfactory for the following reasons. * Apart * fr0m fs9bl9n8S3 aae t0 Ws advanced age.shaik Sir Rasa ^in AH is a week character entirely dominated by his wife,the mother of his youngest son.Shaik Abdulla. It is this lady-s ambition that her son should succeed to the Rulership instead of the recognised heir, 1 Shaik Hamad bin Rasa C.3.I. who is the eldest son,but by another wife, f | Shaik Abdulla since his return from England in 1919 had made himself virtually ruler of Bahrain; a position which he abused to an incredible extent. Oppression of Bahrain subject* which had been steadi on the increase reached its height early in the year under his regime. Political murders were becoming common while his administration was so corrupt that there was no security for persons or property.Out- rages against respectable women by Shaik Abdulla and other members of Al Khalifeh family ware becoming of very frecuent occurence.Indignation at , this state of affairs was so great that disturbances appeared imminent, &gt; and it became obvious that if they were to be avoided, the removal of ! Shaik Abdulla from the management of affairs was necessary .Shaik Abdulla *as sufficiently astute to realise that his position was untenable .and sons anted to retire from public affairs, rather than risk disturbances hieh inevitably lead to his downfall. With Shaik Sir Rasa bin AH’s consent,Shaik Hamad took over the management of public business on his behalf.Ror a short time &gt;Ppr8ssio$ decreased aad there was a general improvement.lt soon howeve]became evident that Shailc Abdulla and his mother had no intention of accepting a position in which the former wag subordinate to his elder brother,and was losing his tyrannical hold over the inhabitants. They have therefore employed every means in their power,including intrigues .bribery,intimidation and propaganda to undermine Shaik Hamad T s authority and to stir up opposition and enmity towards the Agency.believing that without the moral support of the Political Agent,Shaik Hamad would be unable to retain his position. The latter although very desirous of affecting some highly necessary reforms, and establishing elementary justice,has found himself hindered at every step by his aged fateher,Shaik Easa,who f s opposition has been aroused and deliberately cultivated by Shaik Abdulla for his own ends, With the position as it is,the death of Shaik Easa would give rise to a sever struggle for supremacy and during his lifetime little amelioratio.n df the situation can be expected unless some ,means can be devised of curbing Shaik Abdullas ambitions and activities. fhe situation has been reported in detail and is under the consideration of Government. 1. Bahrain Trade . Trade has,in general,been very depressed,mainly as the result of the fall in the pearl market,upon which the pros perity of Bahrain almost entirely depends. A great deal of bankruptcy and distress has resulted among the smaller traders. stea ers [.. Shipping . During the latter part of the year mails have called ragularly.but during the first six months the Down Mails were so irregular as to cause serious inconvenience and dislocation of trade. U J udicial (A) There has been a great increase of case work during the year under review. Civil suits disposed of *1 **]**'J .Criminal cases Jp \ I ,several of which were of an extremely complicated nature » and had been in progress for a year or more. (B) The Joint Court consisting of the Political Agent and Shaik Hamad has settled satisfactorily a large number of cases,though many have been unnecessarily complicated by Shaik Abdulla’s inter ference and his endeavours to obstruct the course of justice,to bring Shaik Hamad into ill repute.(C) The Salifeh Coart deals with pearl-Diving cases and consists of / a single venal ^adge,himself a pearl merchant and in the pay of the other merchants* It hag become so corrupt that no justice whatever can be expected from it and divers,the majority of whom are British Protected subjects prefer to drop their cases rather than have them referred to this court,the decisions of which are always a foregone conclusion* By the terms of the Bahrain Order In Council this Court should be composed of two or more membarars appointed jointly by the BUler and the Political Agent in consultation.No attempt to put right the glaring abuses of the diving laws,practiced by empoyers,could be made in the present political situation,as it would be strongly opposed by the wealthy pearling community t and taken advantage of * by Shaik Abdulla as an opportunity to stir dp trouble for his own ends. Nevertheless the position is one damaging to the prestige of H.B.M T s Agency,inasmuch as the divers who are mostly under its protection are unable to obtain any sort of justice. Oppression in the diving trade has of late years greatly exceeded that of any of the other pearling centres in the Culf.lt is hoped that it will be possible to take steps to deal with this situation during the ensuing year,should a favourable opportunity occur. Municipality . The Municipality initiated in Manameh in I92Q has in the past year,effected a very great improvemBHt in the sanitatior of the Town.An improvement in the public health is believed to be noticeable and the fact that Bahrain hasit now been free of plague | for an unusually long period,is attributed by many to the improve ments. The Municipality was,in the early part of the year,under the ban of popular disapproval owing to the tactless behaviour and dishonest methods of an Indian who held the position of secretary. r On his dismissal Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif,a wealthy and enlighte] -ad Persian,was induced to accept the post in an honarary capacity. This gentleman has effected very considerable improvements and the Municipality is now deservedly in favour with all classes. A Municipality has also been started in the Town of Muharraq.,but it is inefficiently in naged.A movement is on foot in Bahrainheaded by viome of the notables to enlist the support of tho Political Agent with a vi m to its being put on a sounder basis # but this,like every other reform in Bahrain,d pends u )on the political relations between members of the ruling family* Climst 9 The rainfall during 1921 was decidedly below the average* The forty days t 3hamal« or northerly wind,which usually sometahtt alleviates the hot weather was a complete failure;the season therefore constituted the hottest and most unpleasant known for many years* Medical * The popularity of the Victoria Memorial Hospital appears to have Mflxs&amp;texsdtadqc decreased considerably during the last few years. Its work,ac ording to reports,is considered to compare very unfavour ably with that of the American Mission hospital,which has during the year treated above ten thousand,including 503 major 313 minor ajDcrstfc operations* There Is a great demand for further medical work in Bahrain since a large proportion of cases tsken in the Mission hospita' are from the mainland and they cannot deal with a large number of less important cases in Bahrain* The Political gent has been approach* by m? ny of the local notables including the n adhi with a view to securing more modem and energetic administration of the Victoria Memorial Hospital which they would appreciate as being free from religious considerations* This appears very desirable,since the American doctor is frequently absent from Bahrain during which periods the Mission hospital is cldsed. The sultan of If&amp;jfl * was engaged throughout the year in hostilities with his hereditary enemy Bln Rashid,ruler of Hail # whioh place he eventually captured after a protracted siege which was brought to a close mainly by financial tactics. Much friendly correspondance has passed vith the Sult&amp;n, as has also been the case with Bin Jiluwi.Amir of Hass&amp;.The latter ia most businesslike and prompt in se tling claims against his ^ subjects,an unusual attribute in ah Arab ruler* * M &amp;r l.zia lurvoy . H.I.M.S Palinurus carried out ^survey of the harbou Qatif,Ras Tanureh and a part of Juball,with a view to discovering their possibilities as ports for the province of Hassa.These plac were found to be unsuitable fs port ? for large vessels of the BtInflia typa„which tho Sultan of Uajd desired ahoald make tHem ports of call.

One half of the year was spent in touring, and as a result th® hospital was open only part of the year. I wish to express my sincere appreciation to Dr. Moerdyk, who though busy with language study rendered valuable service during my absence, and was ever helpful during my presence. It was he who discovered the first case of plague last year, and he gave aid, to the degree that people would accept aid in the early fight against the inroads of the dread disease. Miss Dalenberg, in her first year as hospital superintendent, did yeoman service, and made her introduction into many homes during those trying days of the plague. What an immense help she has been can only be appreciated by men who have tried to run a large household, unaided, for after all a hospital is very much like a house, a very large house.- 2 of the year was to Nejd.

Two days after our camel caravan left Hofhoof, we were met by special dispatch riders from the Sultan carrying a letter for me stating that he was seriously ill and urging me to come with all possible speed. We had to open up some well- packed cases of drugs and supplies in the open desert, pick out something here and there, and start out with one assistant leaving three to follow with the supplies, and with one of the messengers w* rode post-haste on our camel express to Riadh. But camel riding is for the uninitiated more a ques tion of endurance than speed. We travelled fifteen hours a day for three days and thereby arrived one day sooner than they expected us. The Sultan was suffering from a severe cellulitis of the face, which after being lanced and treated fortunately responded quickly to the healing art. On the sixth day after our arrival a public reception was held by the Sultan, his first public appearance for a month, which was attended by about 5000 people.

The next morning iere was a persistent and loud door, and our bedouin of yesterday 5 was shouting, ‘ Oh you of little mercy, get up and give me some medicine.’ We remained in Raidh thirty-nine days and then on Christmas, we bade farewell to the Sultan and the many friends in the castle, and lastly, to the aged father of the Sultan, old, fat and rheumatic, who had not received much benefit from our medicines. I expressed to him my desire to return the next year and he kindly responded, ‘Yes, and God willing you will bring better medicine then.’ The town of Shukra was to be our next stop and we travelled in a straight north-westerly direction. The first night we camped in the Wadi Hanifa bed with the beautiful gardens of Deraiye on either side. This is one of the prettiest spots I have ever seen in Arabia, and was formerly the capital of the Saouds. The ruins of their old castles are still pointed out high up on the cliffs west of the Wadi bed. The date gardens here are splendid and fruits and vegetables abound. Unfortunately the producing area is small and all agricultural efforts are the result of tremendous cost, for all irrigation is done by water drawn by donkeys, camels, cows, or women, as the case may be, from wells anywhere from 50 to 150 feet deep..4&gt;SQI lo 8- C . oil re0-e«t,8IifanoO bus ^pnebiaefl ri ald’Iia . ^S^I ^lajjnaL rlJ'c! leiirfei/a f w.I f ih^HbM ^-s) nlsd'q.aO wTndblaeH IboxJ-IXoh axlw; oJ - ^xBCeioaa c iebnU £110 ’ OT . driXTK^QIMOq Our camels were not very good animals. They had made several long, weary trips through the almost foodless desert, and were now on their way home. Three of them were so weak that even without any burden they could hardly keep up with the caravan. When an animal is practically starved it seems to lose its sight and will stop in its tracks or couch somewhere and remain there waiting for death to come slowly or for wolves to hasten its last hours. I have seen several camels and donkeys in this state, but no Bedouin will waste a bullet to make a merciful end to their poor faithful servant of the desert which alone makes existence in the desert possible. But the desert is not only hard on the camel. One evening shortly after we had camped a Bedouin with one camel and his wife and ten year old son camped near us. The wife was sick with tuberculosis, the son was the only remaining child of seven, the others having died within the last three years of small pox and measles. Due to the drought of the last three years he had lost fifty sheep, all he possessed, and of his camels only this one was left, and it was so near to exhaustion that it was nearly blind. ? erk n-i JxrebiaeHi saronoq 6 i not very good animals.

The town is very fanatic, and almost every evening, yes, before and after each meal we had to defend our faith. Yet, some of the people of Shukra I shall remember as the best Moslems I ever met. Sheikh Ibrahim, on whom I did a double hernia, took an honest interest in me. He was very much concerned about the hereafter, and pleaded with me to read the Koran, accept it as the word of God and turn Moslem. His sons, too, frequently called on me and sought to convince me of the truth of Islam. Here too I was offered a house and wives if I would but remain and become a Moslem. I once asked Sheikh Ibrahim if he had ever prayed for me. He looked at me in astonishment. No, he had not, ‘Well, Sheikh,’ I responded, ‘I have prayed for you, and I do pray for you every day, that God give you a speedy recovery from your operation and restore you to complete health, and not only you, but all the people on whom we have operated, and all who come to us for medicine, that the medicine be blessed and restore health.’ I believe the Sheikh was almost persuaded that I might enter Glory too.ntre of the slave traffic, of which revival atthe presenttime. From &gt;t they are brought by way of ^ to Shukra, and from here they various parts of Nejd. Most of Raidh where the Sultan has first st are usually sent to Hassa and coast, where there is a gre at for pearl divi ng. I have seen i squared Shukra examined and iown as do horse-traders with have watched a string of black en in red calico dresses being led w streets of Raidh to the Imam’s )d them in the desert sitting four seats slung on the camel’s back, on a group of thirty-nine entering sa, to be sold there for 1,000 to 36. 3 itements seen in Shukra was a ade by towns-people on a tribe of ere encroaching on that part of id to the towns-people for their ght wild shouting of men arose, camels filled the air, and dark rushed to the town gates. Ere long wo heard the soft thud of many camels. The next day was Sunday, and the town was as quiet as a Blue Law town in New England, but late in the afternoon there was a great stir. Everybody either ran to the town gate or got up on a house top. The raiders were returning. I stood on a sand dune near the town gate and took a few pictures as the men on camels crowded together to enter the town gate. After a stay of eighteen days we started for Aneiza. This too was a five days’ journey by camel caravan, the world’s oldest and slowest way of travel. Aneiza is a city of merchants. It is a great center for caravans, and as such, men have pushed out from here to Damascus, Aleppo, Mecca, Baghdad, Busra, to the towns of the Persian Gulf and to India. Most of Arabia’s greatest merchants originated in Aneiza or vicinity. At the present time there is no great amount of trade being carried on in the town itself, but its sons, now more or less wealthy merchants from all parts of the Arabic-speaking world, return there to a great extent for their vacations, or to retire. It is by far the least bigoted, and most enlightened town in Nejd. Newspapers from Iraq, Egypt and India are very common; and a few English papers from Bombay 2w&amp;armo 10 11 ;iven to me. Several men spoke iglish and one had travelled all we treated as cordially as in hospitality was here shown at ere no crowds at our heels in the ise was cast at us by passers by. out every evening and given n.

He was of course off by a friend. The next day he is his bandage. When asked answered, ‘I could not see, so I where is the bandage ? ’ ‘ Oh, I jert.’ Only a six hours’ camel ride from Aneiza is Boreida, the capital of Kaseem. It is completely surrounded by a sea of yellow sand. For one who loves the desert it is a beautiful place. From it, one sees the sand dunes, the shepherd and his flocks, camel caravans coming and going, and the Bedouin tents. And there are always many Bedouins here for the Sultan has a treasury and a supply house here and a Bedouin always looks for gifts. Boreida, like Shukra, is very fanatic, and not at all like its near neighbour, Aneiza. Here there were no invitations to spend the evening ; no requests to dine ; only the cold scowl of the bigot and the half-hearted friendliness of him who wants to be friendly but fears the scorn of the multitude. It is worthwhile to think about the cost of such a tour, the expense of which is entirely paid by the Sultan. At the port of entry our goods are permitted to go through without a customs declaration, without search and without duty. Every donkey, camel and man received his hire, frequently a house must be rented, servants supplied, and always we are boarded well at state expense. When leaving a place we are given liberal rations for the journey,i&amp;cmwo! 12 ways gives me a fee and the nee and we all get a change of imate of the above named ex- f the fee and gifts, would place 000 rupees. &gt; Sultan is willing to spend even to relieve his subjects from is great progress, as well as a value of modern medicine, rst time the Mission had the y Shukra, Aneiza, and Boreida. .rst time a doctor ever came to in each place our professional •eat demand.

Here the Mission grangers, as several visits have lere is also a good deal of travel d Bahrein. for its many springs and large id we arrived in the fruit season, ious water-melons, cantaloupes, figs and dates. 13 Hofhoof is a great center for Bedouins ; in fact several thousand live just outside the town, and many more come from the surrounding desert to trade their dihn and wool for wheat, dates and clothing. In August we spent five days in Kateef, where we were called to see a special case. Kateef has been open to the Mission for years but it is some time ago now that a medical tour was made to that needy, malaria-ridden district. An interesting summary of these trips shows that we spent forty-seven days travelling, divided as follows : on donkeys, four days; in sailboats, eight days; on camels, thirty-five days. The total number of treatments given in these tours were ; clinic treatments, 9,318; Neo-salvarsan injections, 120; and the operations performed were; major, 165 ; minor, 361. Always after reporting a tour, no matter how successful it has been, we cannot help but express our regret that during this time the home base has to be neglected. For the Mason Memorial Hospi tal receives patients from all parts of the Persian Gulf and even from areas far into Persia and Arabia. Some patients travel twenty and thirty days to get here. It is pathetic when after such14 15 to closed doors. We have long Bahrein a two-doctor hospital, al Conference recognized this in rst time.

Dead rats and 1 pigeons were piled on rubbish &gt;ts. A moderate estimate would by about 5,000, or one in every pulation. During the epidemic hospital was of course very rere very busy visiting the stricken and inoculating when vaccine was available. During the last three months of the year the V work in the hospital was very heavy. A very large number of patients have been coming from the hinterland of Muscat. At one time twenty patients came together; fourteen of whom were operative cases. Even before they came every bed in the hospital was occupied and there were several cases waiting for operations, so you can imagine what sort of congestion we frequently have to put up with. The hospital has outgiown -V its limited quarters, for we have adequate space for only thirty patients and yet we frequently have to accommodate as many as sixty. This year, as other years, the hospital has furnished the evangelistic men with a real field for work. On Sunday mornings the chapel is nearly always filled with patients, and they are an appre ciative and attentive audience. The fact that so many of them are strangers here no doubt gives them greater courage and freedom to attend. Not infrequently they discuss parts of the sermon among themselves, and many read portions of Scripture with the colporteur or among themselves. It is encouraging to hear them ask for Persian16 17 Gospel parts for some friends at immer Mr. Rosenthal, the Paris Bahrein. A few years ago he tal funds for building the ‘Rachel and he now offered to pay for ^o additional rooms. We are very /Osenthal for this offer for we are f small rooms that can be used as family wards.

The Bahrein Station and whole express their gratitude to r their gifts which will make us serve the community of which we We also received several guild boxes. We would gladly receive more. We are aware that there are women’s societies at home who would gladly send us hospital supplies if they only knew our need. We also wish to thank a member of the South Holland, 111., church for a gift of $100 which we are using for cement floors and hospital equipment. The report of the women’s work is written separately, but I wish to make it known to friends of the hospital that whereas we formerly pled for more help, and complained of being shorthanded, we now have every reason to be grateful, for under Miss Dalenberg with the two Indian nurses the work is well cared for and we are not only equipped, but are actually taking care of an ever-increasing amount of work, particularly obstetrical work.

We have every reason for gratitude for the present and past, and good ground for hope for the future. L. P. Dame, m.d. Report of the Women’s Medical Work Bahrein, 1923-24 The report of the Women’s Medical Work in Bahrein for the last four or five years has been very short: not more than one or two paragraphs, I believe. This year I am afraid it will be longer. This is not because more work has been done, or that the work has increases in significance. It would take volumes to record the work done by one lone nurse in Bahrein during the past few years. But it means that during this past year there have been more hands to do the work.g year have been running about the gar. The total number of patients 8. Of these, 3,106 were new cases. ; of the twelve, we kept record of the the patients and find that over 60/£ rsians. The remaining 40% was ichis, Bahranis, Jews, Arabs, and a luring the summer when the men le women are more free to go about, er. This is particularly true of the service has been the means of a larger number of the better class ians. It is no longer a novelty to iping at the gate and well-dressed i women alighting. 'S were led two days in the week by in, one day by the nurse, and the days by lady missionaries of the i-e or after dispensary prayers the itairs to read to the in-patients. Oui irpreter made the first openings for yer-meetings. She introduced them village where several successive held, and from there it was easy to i between other villages and settle- village prayer-meetings were, as a matter of fact, in a large way made possible through friendships made in the hospital in times past. Our number of in-patients, forty in all, seems low but it does not mean that we had empty wards for any length of time. A number of the patients we had were the kind that stay months and months. One, a paralysis case, was an in-patient over a year and a gun-shot wound case was with us over six months. If it were possible for us to accommodate whole families, or at least men and women together, we should have many more patients. Many times families come great distances, and while the wife, mother, sister or daughter stay for treatment, the others have no place to stay. One six-bed ward, as we have so often pointed out, is entirely insufficient to meet these needs. We are glad to report that two family rooms will be added to the quarantine rooms which are now being used for that purpose. This, as you have read in the report of the men’s medical work, is due to the generosity and interest of Mr. Rosenthal. These new rooms will be used by the women as well as by the men, as the need or occasion may arise. Major operations performed by Dr. Dame, or by Dr. Moerdyk in the absence of the former, number22 23 rations by nurses, 26, and Neo- dons, 13. Three major operations recently were on patients from ler places in Persia, who come all rein for that purpose, e formed a large part of the work the most interesting phase of it 1 vere made, 103 of which were in add, neighbouring islands.

It has been our ambition since the tours were begun but since more or less of an experiment up to as not advisable to begin women’s i no women came out for treatment illages toured thus far, we hope that the presence of a nurse and a woman assistant or two, if known to the women of the villages, will bring them out. At least we hope to give it a fair trial for these women are too far distant and too backward to be reached in any other way. Obstetrical work continues to thrive. Fifty-three cases were taken care of this year, nine of which were normal. When a nurse is sent for in a normal case it is a sign of enlightenment and education in the home. Nurse Sundri and I were called to one place from which, when we pronounced the case normal we were promptly sent home again. Obstetrics is the branch of medical work that should be developed most emphatically in Bahrein. In no other place in the Gulf are conditions found such as exist here. And it is only by patient, unrelenting and diligent toil, and practical teaching and demonstration, that we can nope to educate the women to higher ideals. Then, when they have learned to want better care, then we must be equipped and ready to give them the best there is to offer. A few have learned; others are waking up. Our hopes for these women will be realized when we get the new Women’s Hospital, in which we shall be able to take care of them properly. One of our obstetrical cases was in Darein, which tookf.

Had we had a proper place to keep this patient we should have insisted that she came to Bahrein. An interesting side issue which became a main issue this summer was in connexion with five so- called Armenian girls rescued from slavery by the political agent of Bahrein. When Major Daly was travelling down from Busrah via the B.I. he heard about five Armenian girls who had been sold at Kuweit, were married there and then taken to Qutar. He had been hearing of an increase in this traffic along the coast as well as inland, and decided it was time to investigate. So he sent to the Sheikh of Qutar to have these five girls released and sent to Bahrein. Their Qutar husbands had to give them up and they arrived in Bahrein, where they were sent to the house of one of the rich pearl merchants of this place, whose brother had been involved in their gale and transfer to Qutar. Here they were placed in the men’s mejlis and locked up. A few days later the political agent sent for them in order that he might learn their story, but nothing could be ‘wormed’ out of them except the story they had obviously been instructed to tell by their late , 9 d ox ujoxtori ex'J' ev&amp;d I t ix8 , J\nj 3 vi ©8 Xne xbedo xaom -hjg\ XboxJ'xIo Qrlv ox wxBXeioeS ^bcfU .'lIifD nBiBieH eilX nx Jiiabi: b©H24 25 twenty-four days and the other one Had we had a proper place to keep should have insisted that she came g side issue which became a main ier was in connexion with five so- n girls rescued from slavery by the &gt;f Bahrein. r Daly was travelling down from B.I. he heard about five Armenian sen sold at Kuweit, were married i taken to Qutar.

A few days later ent sent for them in order that he leir story, but nothing could be of them except the story they had instructed to tell by their late masters. They were terrified, refused to unveil, insisting they were Moslems of the Aneza tribe. The story they told seemed quite impossible ; they said they had been handed over by their tribe by Nejdis who had divorced them in Kuweit where they remarried and were taken to Qutar. As long as they refused to tell the truth nothing could be done toward sending them back to their people. Moreover, they did not seem to want to be released. It is at this point that the Mission comes into the story. The Political agent told Dr. Dame about it and asked his help. Dr. Dame offered the women’s side of the hospital as a place for them to stay, and suggested that the Mission ladies try by friendship to win their confidence gradually and thus get their story from them. When they first came to us they were terrified. Being in the hands of the ‘ Hakuma ’ held terrors for them such as they had never experienced in then- hardy desert life, and being handed over from one seat of judgement to another did not make matters more cheerful. They regarded every one who questioned them in any way in the light of an enemy. We made very little headway at first. They insisted their story was true and kept repeat ing it. The older ones would say, ‘ I want no food26 27 but my husband.’ Then the little est not more than ten years old, horus, ‘ I want my husband.’ They tearful whenever we came near and 3 d their faces before us. The hunger st long, however. Our black helper, the first to win their confidence, r changed the trend of their tale : king about their husbands and began uestions with apparent truthfulness. &gt;y originally came from Jebel ez ardin, and if the government really , they would like to go back to their remembered they had been stolen ' small, but of their former life they 3 .

She is still with us ;urn to her husband, who has been l X, sent for from Qutar and with whom she will live if he consents to staying in Bahrein under British surveillance. Busrah Mission Station is now woven into the tale. We cast ourselves upon them, refugees and all, for upon our arrival there it was made clear that the camp at Nahr Omar would not accept the girls for it is a Christian camp and they still insisted they were Moslems. And the British authorities in Busrah, as in Bahrein, had no place to keep the girls except in prison. Rather than see them taken there, we put them up at the Mission, while the Busrah authorities wired to Baghdad for advice concerning their disposal. This was slow in coming. The four girls attended the Mission service on Sunday morning, and many curious glances were cast in their direction. The next day, and for many days after, they were visited by Busrah Christians, Syrians and Assyrians who had lost wives, daughters or sisters before and during the war. They came in droves, in the hope that among these four refugees they might find one of their lost ones. Finally word came from Baghdad that they should be interviewed again by Major Berry in the presence of a Moslem representative.

One said her Bedouin mother had told her she had been found by them under a pile of brushwood in the desert. All four of them had been taken away from their own people while still very small and had become Bedouins, living in tents in the desert in Summer and moving to the river country in winter. Then the Nejdis had come and carried them off to Kuweit. There they were sold and married and carried off by Qutar merchants. One or two knew the prices that had been paid for them. When asked as to what they desired they should be done for them now, they answered, though not without hesitation, that they wanted to go back to their people. That same morning there were Busrah Christians waiting on the Mission compound waiting to see Major Berry about claiming Fatimah, the smallest refugee. She had been recognized by her own sister. The next down mail brought us the news that all of them had been claimed. One is with the family of one of our former colporteurs, and another is with the family of the keeper of the bookshop in Busrah. The last we heard of them was that they had discarded their Arab clothes.1 J 28 29 ,q two days before we left Basrah, questioned one by one and each told 'ally. One said her Bedouin mother e had been found by them under a &gt;od in the desert. All four of them l away from their own people while and had become Bedouins, living desert in Summer and moving to the in winter. Then the Nejdis had ed them off to Kuweit. There they married and carried off by Qutar ne or two knew the prices that had lem. When asked as to what they hould be done for them now, they gh not without hesitation, that they ack to their people, orning there were Busrah Christians 5 Mission compound waiting to see nout claiming Fatimah, the smallest had been recognized by her own jxt down mail brought us the news i had been claimed. One is with the 5 of our former colporteurs, and h the family of the keeper of the israh. The last we heard of them had discarded their Arab clothes and had adopted the native Christian dress, i.e. high heeled shoes and hats, and little Fatimah had had her hair bobbed ! At the same time that these up-country girls were with us in Bahrein, a Yemeni girl was sent to us also. She was a genuine Arab who had been stolen from her home in Yemen while her husband and brother were away fighting for Bin Saoud. The thieves came in the night, stuffed her veil into her mouth as a gag, and carried her off on a camel. They travelled one whole month across the desert. When they arrived in Qutar on the opposite coast, she was bought by a Bahrein merchant who brought her here. She was discovered by the political agent and stayed with us while he made arrangements for her return to Yemen. Her husband was made to pay a fine of 5,000 rupees. This makes a long story for a report but i think it must be of interest to the whole Mission to know that something effective has been done in Bahrein to check the terrible trade of girls that has been going on so freely and unrestrictedly this past decade. I am sure we all feel grateful to our Heavenly Father for His providence and care for these Syrian girls, and grateful to the British government for giving the Mission an opportunity to help save30 31 avery and bring them into Christian que experience of the Hospital has nng of an orphan.

We have made new rules s for obstetrical cases, and hope to do our part toward making this a self-supporting hospital in the near future. Several improvements have been added this year. The iron beds and bedside tables mentioned in last year’s report have materialized. A trunkful of supplies was received from Westfield, N.J., and also six all-wool blankets. A dozen blankets are on the way from South Holland. Mr. Rosenthal, in his last visit to the hospital, was grieved to see patients sleeping on beds without sheets, and asked us to make a list of needed linens that he might supply. A recent gift of $100 has made it possible for us to have new cement floors in our dispensary rooms, and we are adding furniture and equipment from time to time with an eye toward using it in the new hospital in the near future. In every department of the work we feel the restraint of cramped space and limited equipment. We feel that the Women’s Work in Bahrein has reached the stage where institutional work must be developed. It is no longer the pioneer work that it was ten years ago, and the needs that were pointed out last year are still here, greater than ever before. Cornelia Dalenberg, r.n. C. L. S.

He called again on Hew Year’s Bay, when he was slightly more cordial than on the first occasion. Shaikh Sir Isa has now consented to receive the allowance made to him from State funds. His hAcellency Shaikh Hamad’s relations with his father have shown a distinct improvement, during the year. He relies very considerably on his brother Shaikh Abdullah’s advise. The latter has been very helpful to the administration during the three and hal^ months I held charge of the Agency. He is a man of considerable ability and it is a pity he is not more trustworthy. Some of the junior members of the AX Khalifah have been employed in appointments of lesser importance in the adminis tration and it is Hoped that the members of this family who now draw allowances without giving tiny return may, in the future, (z Je be employed in such posts as aA/ be* founa^suited to their some what limited education. The relations of the Deputy Huler himself with the Political Agency have at all times been extremely friendly. He never hesitates to apply to the Political jigent for advice in allmatters of administration in which he feels that he may need it. Ti.is advice is freely given when asked, but it has been my consistent policy to make Shaikh Hamad stand on his own feet ■ 4 ' / instead of leaning heavily on the Political Agent for support in all matters, as has been his tendency in the past. X think the excellent instruction received from ka^or haly is bearing _/ ; I- fruit ana that in course of time Shaikh Hamad may develop into r /■ f \ a really capable Arab Huler of an Arab State, purged of the abuses, especially in relations to its Shiah suojects which // i ' « ■!' disgraced Bahrein in the past. f f f t' .

The year unfortunately proved a bad one for the pearling industry and some bankruptcies have resulted and there has been asjac distress among the poorer classes Consequently in December the Bahrein Government issued a moratorium deferring the collection of debts due to the shopkeepers by divers until the commencement of the diving season of 191:7. The Salifah Court, the abolition of which, caused a certain amount of resentment in Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, was reestablished at the close of the year, measures were t&amp;Aen, however, to prevent a return to the baa old. system by which a single llaxdiuda sitting as judge weighted the scales of justice in favour of nit own fraternity. The Court now consists of four members one of whom is himself a diver, with an intelligent member of the ruling family named Rashid bin aohamad Al Khalifah as president. It is hoped that this reformed Court which certainly possesses ail the necessary technical knowledge will deal out speedy and even nanded justice in all diving suits. The work of boring to tap the underground supply of water was very successful and wells have now been sunk, 7 at kanama and seven at kuharr&amp;q.

The perpetrators have not yet been brought to book, but h* the suspicion which at first rested on sepoys of the disbanded Levy appears to have been unfounded.

During the last ten months, Indian Surveyors have been making a plane table survey of the Manama oity and all the villages and gardens and cultivated areas on the islands. The following villages with their gardens have now been completed. Jafair Qadim Esgaiya Earsia Mahooz Obairdah Bilad Khodra Man! Jiblat Habshi A survey and assessment of date gardens connected with the A1 Khalifa Estate case in which property valued at almost two lacs is involved, has also been made, for the assist ance of the Court in settling this case which has been going on for 26 years. There remains a survey which is to be made of the towns of Maharaq and Hidd, also the issuing of title deeds for all houses and property which have been mapped.page -2- Survey Department Oontd. The System has heen as follows.- Before commencing the survey, a list is prepared of persons owning the property in the village concerned. Letters are written to them asking them to set up mud pillars as boundary posts to their gardens. This brings boundary disputes to light. Survey is done to a scale of 100 feet to an inch traversing and interfilling with planetable. This suits both large and small gardens some being 1,500 feet long and some 10 feet long. The plots of all the gardens and the measurements are written on the sides of each piece. Taterchannels, springs and paths are also shown. Each piece of garden is given a serial number and a schedule is kept, showing names of gardens and owners. A register is made for each village with an index map to a scale of 500 feet to an inch showing the relative position of Survey plots. After the survey the villagers are summoned at the place itself and boundaries of all gardens are described to them.page -3- Survey Department Pont d. The period and source inf water taken by eaoh garden is recorded. The actual owners seldom know this detail so as one to rely on the information of the tenants. But as it is . . given in the presence of^the owners and ^enants there is the least possibility of wrong information being given. Another difficulty is recording the shares in the gardens. Very small gardens are often divided into numerous shares, subdivided and then divided again. leither the owners nor the tenants show the slightest sympathy with the work, on the contrary they consider it unnecessary trouble. The owners who are generally Shaikhs have no knowledge of the size of the boundaries of their properties, and if they hold documents, the documents do not show the boundaries clearly. They appoint persons as their Agents to appear with their documents with the surveyors. The Bahrani tenants give little assistance seeing no benefit in the work, considering that their importance as possessors of knowledge of the garden boundaries will be diminished when the settlement is over.page -4- Survey Department Contd, Some gardens have many names, and often several people olaim a garden by different names. In spite of these difficulties, a large amount of valuable work has been done last year. The total expenditure of the present Survey Department, until 30th Jamadi A1 Thany 1345 corresponding 6th January 1927 is Rs. 34,000/- which includes a large of expensive equipment.GOVERmiEITT OE BAHHAIN ((/O' Offiae of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.

These provide instruction in the Xoran and are purely religious schools. Besides these, there is a school in Manama and another in Maharaq, managed by a com mittee of notables under the presidency of Shaikh Abdulla Bin Isa A1 Khalifa. These schools were started by him after his return from his first visit to England about three years ago. The Government contributes Rs. 1,000/- per month for the upkeep of the schools.

It is hoped that after the schools have been in existence for a year or two more, that some of the pupils will he qualified to take up posts as clerks in the town. Previously^local merchants made large annual contributions to the schools, hut this practice has almost entirely fallen off, owing partly to the tightness of money this year, and also partly to the fact that people are not entirely satisfied with the management of the schools.

Formerly property was badly described in sale deeds and constant cases occurred of properties being sold twice, or being sold by persons who had no right to the ownershin. According to the present system, on submission of sale deed for registration, the property is measured in the presence of owner, or in case of sale, before both parties, and a plan is prepared. Proclamation giving brief description of property is issued, inviting objections within the period of a month. Objections are referred to the Courts^, if none are made^ the new deed is prepared on durable paper with a plan on the back of the deed. Oopies are kept, and the original deeds are filed in the Land Registration Department A fixed fee of Rs. 10/- is charged for each registration.

Bated 20th Shahbhaan, '45/23rd Feby *27 TRADE Imports for the year 1926 shew a decrease under 1925, covering all kinds of cargo, except loaf sugar, which has nearly doubled in value. 'R. E.' cargo shows 8.8$ of receipts as against 8.2$ in 1925, also cotton yarns (for the local sail weaving industry) shew a substantial increase. This industry is carried on at several coast villages and is gradually increasing. Locally weaved sails and cloths are sold at the weekly public markets at Manama. This decrease is generally attributed to a moderate pearling season in the year 1925 and cheaper world prices for the pearls gained, which results in tightness of money, and consequent inability to purchase more expensive commodities. This is most marked in rice and cotton piei?egoods; and it is noticed that merchants do not now carry large stocks, particularly of the dearer kinds of rice.Trade Contd. A noticeable feature is the increasing popularity of hardware (aluminium and enamel ware) and earthenware imported from the Jontinent of Europe. There are four private electriclighting sets working satisfactorily; and possibly this method of illumination will be found the most useful and may become popular. The port is mainly served by the B. I. Steam navigation Company’s steamers, and the Hansa line have regular bi-monthly callings. fc/v - ^ J '&gt; A new wharf has been built as an addition to the Customs Pier, which serves native craft bulk cargo with marked usefulness. The import of motor cars continues steadily, there being private cars, taxi cars, and four lorries running, in all 140. The majority of motor cars are Pords, but there is now a tendency to import the more expensive high- power type. An interesting development of native craft is the application of a British marine engine to the locally built craft, with marked success,page -3- Trade Oontd. marked success, there bein ^5 fourteen of such craft working commercially, several of which are engaged exclusively on cargo work with the mainland.

PBARLIITG IlJDUSfHY. Trade in pearls after the last season was not good. This may be accounted for by the catch itself being below the average, by the vacillating value of the franc, and by the general falling off in the pearl trade resulting from the increased production of cultured pearls. The sales during and immediately after the season were small. Numbers of merchants were left with pearls in their hands and up till now many of them have not sold. It is a fact that Mr. Pack, the representative of Messrs. Rosenthall, who used to be the biggest buyer, this year bought 65;! less than his average during the last three years. The result has been a general depression in trade as the commerce of the State depends almost entirely on the pearl industry. The slackness in trade after last year's season has resulted in a general tightness of money. Tar jars who did badly last year are unwilling to finance their Narkhudas to the extent that they used to, or at least untilpage -2- Pearling industry Oontd. until they have recovered part of the amounts which they lent during previous years. Some Narkhudas made agreements with their Tarjaars to repay annual instalments on the amounts which they borrowed. In many cases they have been unable to do this and the Tarjars now refuse further loans until these instalments are paid up. The uncompromising attitude of several large Tar jars had led to a number of cases in court in which the tarjars have claimed their instalments and the Narkhudas professing to have no money have offered instead their divers’ debts or even their boats. Tarjars refused to accept anything except cash and in many cases produced 'Sennads” guaranteeing payments of instalments in money signed by Narkhudas last year. According to the law, and the diving customs, the tarjars were justified in their demands. A deadlock was reached. Tarjars refused to advance any money for the coming year, therefore narkhudas could not pay their divers who clamoured for 'Tesquam” Pending the activities of the new Diving Oourt, the Government summoned a temporary court consisting of Khan Bahadur Abdul Behman ^aymi, Haii Mohomed Bin Hindi; Haji Abdu Ali Bajab, and the Adviser. The court enquired into the largest and most urgent cases of this nature. With considerable difficulty settlements were made between tarjars and narkhudaspage -3- Pearling industry Oont d. narkhudas, the latter being persuaded to take very muoh reduced money instalments and the balance in divers' debts and in boats. A very great deal of persuasion was needed to effect settlements in these cases, and had the tesquam been any higher this year, I have no doubt whatever that the cases would never have been settled. As soon as the Cases were closed the tar jars hnnded out cash for the tesquam and the divers were paid their advances. appears that in every case the tar jars have got the best of the bargain* They have acquired boats or divers from their narkhudas, but against this must be considered the fact that they ha,ve made very large advances to these narkhudas in former years and according to them, they have not received reasonable profit on the money lent. It is perhaps natural that in every case the Nakhudas assert that they did exceptionally badi=y last year, and the tar jars recite the number of high prices obtained by narkhudas for their pearls. The reduction of the tesquam from Rs. 100/- Sc Rs. 80/- to Rs. 80/- and Rs. 60/- seemed at the time rather severe It was made after much discussion with tarjars and XJarkhudas. It may seem that the divers themselves, being the cla^most affected, should have been consulted, but this, at present, is impossible. The diverspage -4- Pearling industry C?ontd « divers have no organisation and there is no v/ay of ascertaining their views. In this case, without doubt, they would not have favoured the reduction. The divers as a class are absolutely uneducated and are incapable of appreciating any attempts to improve their condition. They never consider the future and do not themselves mind in the least being in debt for their lifetimes. Attempts to legislate for their benefit are invariably dis-appointing as the divers themselves, do not, at the time, appreciate such action. The r eductions were made on the representations of narkhudas and tar jars, who saw they would probably be unable to finance their divers if the rate was as high as last year, as it was in strict accordance with the principles of diving reforms whose object is the gradual abolition of debts and advances, it was sanctioned by the Government. Individual divers, with whom the subject has been discussed, profess to appreciate the object, but that as the last season was a poor one the tesquam should not have been reduced# • ••••••GOVEHIMEUT 0?

Copies of reports on the working of the State Police and Jail from the Commandant are also enclosed. I have the honour to be, Sir Your Obedient Servant,During the last year this important question has received much attention. The staff of the Khalifa Schools, one in Manama and one in Maharak have been augmented by several teachers from Syria, recommended by Sater Baig, formerly minister of Education in Iraq. It is hoped that they will be a success although there is considerable feeling against the system of importing foreigners to teach in Bahrain schools. This is inevitable as local teachers do not exist. A branch of the Khalifa schools has been opened at Rufaa and is so far well attended. The wife of one of the new teachers and another Arab woman in Maharak have organised a class for girls which is attended by various daughters of the ruling family and children of well to do merchants. The Khalifa schools are attended almost entirely by Sunnis, as with one exception all the teachers are Sunni. It was suggested that a separate school should be opened for Shias. Several meetings were held on the subject and all the leading Shias attended and gave their views. It was decided to build a Shia school close to the old Shia mosque at Suk A1 Khamis. The site was chosen as being in the centre of a number of villages. A public subscription list was opened and Shaikh Hamad informed the Shia community that the Government would double the amount subscribed. So far almostEducation Contd•- almost Rs. 5000/- has been promised. It has been decided to start on the building of a small school at Suk A1 Ehamis and probably another school in Manama. The leading Shias of the neighbouring villages have assured the Government that they will send their sons to school. The cost of run ning the schools will be born by the State. This is the first time that there has ever been a Shia school in Bahrain and it is hoped that the result will be successful. The Shia Kadi, Syed Adnan, is giving strong support to the scheme and all the leading Shias are in favour of it. At the same time the Mosque at Sul A1 Khamis is to be repaired for the use of the school. One of the sons of Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohomed A1 Khalifa has been sent to the Beyrout University. His actual fees are being paid by the State. This is the first time that a member of the Ruling Family has made any attempt to acquire education. The son^ of one of the Arab merchants has been sent to school at Brighton Grammar School. The arrangement is a private one. This is the first instance in the history of Bahrain of a boy sent for education in England. The Persian School which is said to be subsidised by the Persian Government is well attended, but it is not patronised by local Arabs or Bahranis owing to its political tendencies. At present the best results are obtained from the American Mission Boy's School. Two scholars from the Mission school have been taken onEducation Contd.- taken on in Government Offices, but when an attempt was made to fill another vacancy of a clerk from the Khalifa Schools nobody was found with the requisite amount of education# The Government has every wish to encourage the State schools by giving appointments to the scholars in the various Government Offices but so far the standard of education falls considerably below that required in a junior clerk.LAM) registration department during 1 the°year tran8fera of P^opQ^ty were registered !• a. 3. 4 . 5 * 6 * 7. 0. 9. 10 . 11 . 12 .

Total Imports for 1926 - Rs. 1,86,04,280/- Total Exports ' - 88,08,590/- Total Imports for 1927 - 1,90,63,505/- Total Exports ' - 84,45,940/- There has been a remarkable increase in the import of Sugar loaf and ground, and also in coffee. Owing to an exceptionally good coffee crop the price was cheap, 30^o less than last year which encouraged Bahrain buyers to purchase in large quantities in the expectation of a rise in prices. ; r ( Owing to business competition between Java and beet sugar, sugar prices decreased 20$ on last year which resulted in increased imports to Bahrain. The heavy price of sugar in Persia may also have contributed to the increase in imports. The pearl market showed an increase of 15$ - 20$ over last year, owing to this the diving community had more money to spend and therefore more piece goods and sundry goods were imported. A 50$ increase in import of A.P.O.C. oil is the result of the A.P.O.C. agents giving credit to their purchasers. Import of Ford cars has decreased as purchasers are waiting for the long expected new model. Demand for expensive high power seven seaters has increased. Imports of timber, coir yarn and tamarind from MalabarMalabar by Dative crafts are gradually decreasing and these commodities are now being carried by steamers as the freight has been reduced. The number of motor jallyboats is double that of 1926. Sail cloth, grass mats and pottery are manufactured locally,chiefly by the Shia Bahranis. The demand for local built boats has been better during 1927 than during the previous year. Altogether trade is generally good and the bazaars show a larger variety of articles for sale than previous years. Trade in Manama is far better than in Maharak. Maharaq shopkeepers complain that owing to disembarkation of passen gers steamer and native craft cargo in Manama, most of the buying and selling takes place in that port. An arrange ment by which certain native craft will unload direct at Maharak, passing the Customs there, is under consideration. Maharak merchants are anxious that the proposed road connect ing the tw r o islands should be built as it w r ould greatly increase the trade in Maharak.MUNICIPAL IT liCS Maharak. Luring the last year a Municipal Council under the presidency of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa has been established in Maharak. The Municipality is financed by the State and also collects some revenue from house taxes which are^on a lower scale feo those in Manama. Since its inauguration there has been a considerable improvement in the condition of the town and work is being done in widening streets i/t- qJU A», jft. i^lu. * fb-a (M-Wv ' to allow for Motor Traffic. There has been no outward opposition to the Municipality, but as it is a new institution the ultra conservative section of the town do not approve of it. Manama. A new Municipal Council was elected during 1927 and various changes were made on the staff;since then a remarkable amount of work has been done in the town. Several streets in the middle of the bazaar have been widened and many shops and houses have been partly demolished in order to improve streets. The Bazar is now far cleaner and less congested. It has been decided to remove the fruit and fish markets from the inside of the bazar to a place on the edge of the town. A new meat market is being built of cement and corrugated iron in place of the present insanitary erection of date palms. Trees have been planted along several of the main roads. This was formerly impossible owingMunicipalities contd» - owing to lack of water, and the Municipal garden is receiving attention. The overflow from the artesian wells in the town has been regulated and drained off to the Sea. Various local rules have been made such as regulating the number of passengers travelling in boats and launches between the islands, regis tration of coolies, extermination of dogs, free vaccination, compulsory protection of food for sale against flies, extermination of rats, and numerous other measures intended to improve public health and general cleanliness.PUBLIC WORKS Lo fresh public works of any imx^ortance were undertaken during the year but two important building contracts were completed. Ihe Sea Road . I’he second half of this road is now finished and was opened by the Shaikh on 27/9/27. The road now extends from the western end of the town to the Government offices at the eastern corner, a distance of nearly 1500 yards. The road is 30 feet wide and bordered on the sea side by a stone wall with a para pet. The road is a handsome and useful improvement to the town. A mole and three docks for shelter and better accomodation of native craft have been built adjacent to the customs pier. She total cost was Rs. 123,190/-. The Palace The Shaikh's official residence, a large partly stone building, was finished during the year. It stands some distance to the southeast behind the town. It is the first building of cut stone that has been made in Manama. Roads. A considerable amount of work has been done on the island's roads, mostly between Manama and Sakhir. A deviation has been constructed from the main road to the town of Rufaa. fPublic Works contd*- Miscellaneous. ihe Manama Police Station has been partly rebuilt. Many of the places inside the sea wall, formerly foreshore have been filled in and an order has been passed that all the ground between the sea wall and the town, now full of water when the tide is in, must be filled in within two years. A large oil store has been built by the Anglo Persian Oil Company and another store is being built by the Standard Oil Company, on the shore about half a mile west of the town. This is a result of new fire regulations forbidding the storage of more than fifty tins of petrol in any one building within the Municipal area. A considerable amount of private building is being done in Manama and in many quarters stone and mud buildings are replacing straw huts.MISCELLANEOUS department. A department for the proper control and registration of wakf property was instituted during the current year. The department is under the management of the three Sunni Kadis assisted by a council of notables, Shias and Sunnis. There is at present some dissension on the subject as the Kadis object to the presence of the council which is under the presidentship of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa A1 Khalifa. Courts. The Bahrain Court heard 896 cases during the year, the greater proportion being civil cases. A petty court has been instituted to relieve the Bahrain Court which hears of Rs. 100/- and under. Captain Parke and Shaikh Mohomed bin Jabar A1 Khalifa, Amir of Manama.sit on the Court. No^, cases heard in six months amounted to 281.- Captain Parke also sits on a small Joint Court with a Persian representing the protected subjects appointed by the Agency. The New Shara Court consisting of the three Sunnis Kadis was appointed some months ago. They sit tw r ice a week alternatively at Manama and Maharak. No cases are now being sent to the Sunni Kadi Shaikh Quasim who, owing to his advanced age is unable to deal with vrork. Rufaa. A number of wealthy merchants of Manama purchaseoLland on the high ground north of Rufaa and some of them have the intention of building houses there for residence during the summer. The climate is more dry than that of Manama and Muharak. Official Visits . H. E. Shaikh Hamad paid a visit to the Shaikh of Dohan in the summer!

Since that time I am glad to report that no crime of a serious nature has occured and the population as far as it is possible to ascertain are quiet and confident and respect the present Force. I cannot speak too highly of the loyalty and assistance given me by all ranks, including members of the clerical staff. I think it speaks very highly for the general behaviour of all ranks in Bahrain and I have not had a single complaint about any one and that in a place where a very large number of people are out to find the slightest fault with the Police, I consider speaks for itself. Jail. During the year 1927-28 the following prisoners have been dealt with in the State Jail.- Criminals admitted during the year 1st Jany *27 to) 31st December 1927 •• •• •• Convictions previously to 1st Jany '27 Civil Prisoners during the year Total. 9 29Health.

The work hours vary according to the time of year, at present they are 7 to 11-30 A.M. 1 to 4-30 P.M. (Eight Hours) In the hot weather the same number of hours are worked and only the hours of work are changed. Sd/ L.S.Parke, Captain, Commandant, State Police.REPORT OF THE MASON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL 1927 . The general situation in Bahrain has improved very distinctly. The bitter poverty of the people has been much relieved by a fairly good pearl season and hostility toward the powers that rule, so painfully evident in the Past has given place to an apprecia tion of Western political guidance unique in Bahrain’s history. It is a pleasure to mention the cordiality of our European friends, and far more important, a continued and increasing appreciation of the Hospital by the entire community. Perhaps the most delightful feature of the year has been the support of the work by its friends. Mr. Pennings could hardly have done more if he had been a member of the staff. Dr. Dame worked as steadily for the Hospital at home as he does on the field. Dr. Murphy of Detroit, a personal friend of many years lifted the deficit on the Hospital’s work, and gave the whole Bahrain landscape a beautiful rose tint. We have been able to take care of theo / 'eieJbiQiV 9fl^ olXo^ .0 sn *i xdstxuj. — i . o j •euilol 9 c extremely poor this year. The friends who made this possible were many. Mr. Kellogg who makes the corn flakes helped most of all. Jusef Kanoo did nearly as much. Major Holmes who digs our artesian wells opened his heart too as did many others. It was a “ refreshment to the eyes ” to meet with such a response from so many quarters. \ The stream of patients from Persia and from the local Persian community continues to grow, and the situation created by this is becoming serious. Half of our in-patients and nearly that proportion of our dispensary patients cannot understand Arabic. We recommend that the Doctor in Bahrain be given some assurance of permanency in his appointment, and asked to learn Persian in addition to Arabic, annual vacations to Persia being authorized for this purpose.

We have appreciated most of all a separate room which we can use as a laboratory. Routine laboratory exami nations have been made for many patients. Our plans for the preparation and study of Pathological material have materialized only in part, due to trouble with the apparatus. Malaria continues to be the background of our Medical work. Venereal disease still increases. The surprising prevalence of asthma in chronic Malaria cases has continued to puzzle us. We are seeing a larger number of Peptic Ulcers and the question arises whether a vitamjme deficiency may not be a part of their cause. In the Surgical department, after a cautious trial throughout the previous year we have adopted excision of the tarsal cartilage as our treat ment for trichiasis. We are considering its use for all cases of Chronic trachoma. Experience has led to a modification in the technique of the operation which we use for Hernia. We hope that our small percent age of recurrences will not be smaller still, Tutocain a new local anesthetic from Germany seems very promising. EVANGELISTIC. Among the Hospital in patients evangelistic work has been carried on as formerly. The effort is to do personal work with«. i, ■ ■ ‘TRO i 2(*XOW 9rl-. si oiriv oo io c i J39fi'.*x&lt; idBLiU&lt;. ni si 'liijIxvaH A r r f \ a &gt; 1 Fm n rf i ^ T . every patient who offers a mind at all receptive. Mr. Pennings has done the greater part of this work, and he has always had a courteous, and often a cordial reception. Friends of Hospital patients have added to the numbers of those attending Sunday services in the chapel. Morning clinics have been opened by simple services lasting usually about fifteen minutes. Mr. Pecnings and Mr. Hakken and Hanna have all helped. Mottoes have been hung on the walls of the waiting room, and a few distributed in Moslem houses which asked for them. The larger mottoes suitable for public work were secured so late that the plans to make such texts the subject for successive dispensary talks remains to be carried out nextjyear. It is a great pleasure to be able to report a real advance in work done for the villages of the island- Throughout the Winter we maintained regular weekly dispensaries in Jidhofs, Bilad el Kadeem, and Rifaa. After the people had been treated and small operations performed, it was a continual surprise to see how willing and even eager the people were to listen to simple presentations of the Gospel.

Jidhofs to us in the past, but at these weekly outdoor services ranged from twenty-five to nearly or quite a hundred. 1 OURS. Our hopes that we might visit Riadh and Hassa during the year have been disappointed. We received many cordial letters from Bin Saoud but were not able to secure an invitation to visit the interior. In Hassa and Kateef Mohammedan worship has been made uniformly Sunni in character. Worship in Shiah mosques, and Shiah readings are forbidden. This compulsory change in religious practice is bitterly resented of course, and in such an atmosphere it is unlikely that visitors from outside will be wanted for some time. Bin Saoud was forced into this course of action much against his will, and his parti, zans everywhere insist that the oppressive regulations will be revoked just as soon as possible. It is some thing that we may well pray for. We made a very pleasant trip to Kateef just before the new' rules went into effect. We took the Ford with us so we might divide our time between Demam and Kateef. Miss Dalenberg treated the women and Mrs. Harrison did evangelistic work among them. Not as much Surgical work as usual was done on this trip, but as a means for breaking down prejudice it was outstanding. Not a dozen9ri. ''1 f) n ' 1 . x d B . i LU votes could have been mustered in the entire com munity against our return as permanent citizens when the trip closed. A more strenuous trip was made to Muttreh. The demand for Medical and Surgical work was tremen dous, and there was very little time available for any evangelistic work or even for visiting. We made many friends however and came back with renewed conviction that one of the Mission’s greatest oppor. tunities lies in that neglected district and that we must establish a Hospital there just as soon as we possibly can. Even under the unfavourable conditions of the trip, receipts were encouraging so much so indeed that we feel that such work can be made self- supporting from the very beginning if necessary. PLANS. The next step in The Mason Memorial Hospital must be the development of the Laboratory to include the preparation and study of the Pathological Material from operations. This is more important here than at home even, for we never have Post Mortem examinations. As soon as it is financially possible we must secure a qualified Indian Doctor to work with us. It will not be necessary then to close the Hospital when6 7 mustered in the entire corn- urn as permanent citizens &gt; was made to Muttreh.

This than at home even, for we xaminations. lancially possible we must Doctor to work with us. It to close the Hospital when the Missionary in charge is away on vacations or tours. Evangelistically we must develop the village work still further and as soon as the right man can be found open a branch dispensary in Kateef. The attitude of the people there is so cordial that this will probably be possible even now when conditions are so upset. It may easily be the first step toward occupying the interior. Above all things we must show more of the Spirit of Christ in our work so that men may be drawn to Him by it. P. W. Harrison.OPERATIONS PERFORMED IN THE M. M. H. 1927 . ABDOMEN.

Bray, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, who visited the island in November and Sir Denys returned his call. H.E. Sheikh Hamad’s relations with his father have continued to improve throughout the year. He relies more and more on the advice # of his brother Sheikh Abdulla and settles no major problem withou t consu11 ± r i g him. Sheikh Suleiman the eldest son of the Deputy Ruler has worked throughout the year as a member of the Bahrein Civil and Criminal Court. Sheikh Rashid bin Mohamad the Deputy Ruler’s nephew was appointed President of the Salifat ul Ghaus ( the Diving Court) but he was not a success in this position. Other cadets of the Al Khalifa family have been employ ed in minor capacities. The relations of the Deputy Ruler with the Political /i Agent have continued to he ex tamely cordial.

The Land Registration Department has done excellent work throughout the year and the apposition to it has now disappeared and its benefits are appreciated. 369 transfers of property were registered as against 900 pn 1986.

Both bodies are very active an have most progressive ideas. Agriculture. Artesian-»wells have been sunk during the year and many people are buying land for cultivation. Adari water-channel has been re-built.. Education. There has been a great advance in this direction. Eleven boys, sons of Shaikhs and merchants are being educated at Beyrout aad about 640 boys are at school in Bahrain. Expenditure on education has risen to RS. 70,000/- per annum.

Only the followers of Shaikh Abdel L&amp;tif have returned _ to Budeya. Pearl Trade. Ho decision was reached as^to the^use of motor launches which were temporarily forbidden, ^ne Pearling Season of 1928, was better than previous years, and a corresponding improvement appears in the Customs Receipts.

In comparison with the year 1927, the imports of 1928 show increases of 20$ in Loaf Sugar, 15$ in Java Sugar, and 40$ in Tea, This is due to good' crops and the consequent depreciation in wholesale prices. The import of Rangoon F.ice shows a decrease of 25$ under 1927, and Calcutta Ballam rice also shows a decrease of 10$ (though the wholesale prices have fallen by 20$) This is because these imports do not now come by one large consignment in a direct steamer, as previously, but by the ordinary mails, and consequently these would be spread over the whole season. RE-EXPORT cargo shows an increase of 17$ over 1927, *)~~**A il foi*. a very pleasing sign indicating that the merchants appre- Cf ciate the security of passing their goods through Bahrain, ' ' instead of Dubai, where the charges are slighly less. The A.P.O.Coyfs products per British Tanker Steamers ^ are about the same as last year. rji The motor-car market^has not been quite so active as for merly, partly because the State is by now fairly well stocked, and partly because of the late delivery of the new Ford model. I anticipate a little more activity during the coming year, as there is a livelihood of a British firm entering this field of activity. Imports by native craft are less than before, due partly to some dullness of the market in dates and chandals, ftd and partly to steamers’ competition. An important indication of local prosperity, due to a good pearling season, has been in the increase in the import of Piecegoods and fancy goods, which are about 15$ above 1927. Also, the construction of the famous local joliboat has increased during the past year. Other local products are sail-making from locally woven cloth, matting, and pottery which are constant with the demand. The port is served, in addition to native craft, by the B.I.S.E.Coy’s steamers, which call here weekly with the upmail, and fortnightly with the down mail; also Strick steamers call here monthly with cargo direct from l-ingland, and Hansa steamers under a working agreement with the B. I*S.E • Coy’s ete interests. To give further see** security to shipping certain improvements in local port lighting are under consideration; and recently an old beacon at Bab-al-Hathar, off Sheaibah has been rebuilt, and it is greatly appreciated by the native craft plying between this P or “ and Arabia, several wrecks having occurred in this neighbourhood, prior to this work. Financial.Accounts are'caicni are calculated by Arabic Calendar'! There is an increase in revenue but also a large icrease in recurrent expenditure. The Civil List has been greatly Ided to and now amounts to over 5 lacs instead of A^-lacs. Ruling Family. Two of the Shaikh’s younger sons have married! TheKhaiid Shaikhs, banished for murders at ultra, have been permitted to return and are taking over their eoniis- cated property.Uonel IBjeii «I ISaljrjtxK, ijersxscit 17th January, 1929., In reference to the boat-building industry in Bahrein, it may be of interest to note:^ for the year to December, 1926, new craft built and sold in Bahrein were 119; old craft purchased, $0, for the year to December, 1927, new craft built and sold in Bahrein were 7^J old craft purchased, 10. for the year to December, 1928, new craft built and sold in Bahrein were 89; old craft purchased, 14. It will be remembered that quite a number of craft were damaged or lost in the great storm of 1-2 October 1925; and consequently there would be heavier building in 1926. The year 1926 was not a very good pearling season; consequently in 1927 there would not be quite so much money available for expenditure on boat-building. '1’he year 1927 had a good pearling season, and consequently we see that more craft were built and purchased in 1028. The craftsmen at Naim complain, as ever, that business is slack and they are not well paid for their boats; but I notice that they are prettily steadily emoloyed both on new craft and on repairs. Next spring they will of course be busier, on the approach of the pearling season. I think it true to say that the industry is steady and firm with a slight upward tendency. In regard to the canvas-weaving and sail-baking industry; this is steady and copes with the local demand. A settlement of about six families was made at Budayeh in 1924; but this languished owing to lack of drinking-water, and the families departed. Thus we find that fresh centres of the industry have +^ 4 = trAQr» a+. TWfl* Marlrh bin Jumreh. ( iust behind Budayeh); and on land, they are kept busily at work. These workers are all aanaranas; ounerwxse it might perhaps be well if they were settled at Naim close to the boat-building industry. yTZX m,' ' The American Mission at work in Bahrain.

Lieut-Colonel C.C.J.Barrett Held charge of th- Agency till the 28th April, when Captain 0. G. Prior took over. Khan Bahadur Sayyid Siddiq Hasan was India Assistant throughout the year. RTTT.ER OP BA.'R; in AND THK aL-HI,LIPAH FAMILY Shaikh Sir Isa | has been friendly in his attitude, and has not shown any dis-s position to question the present regime. His truculent wife, the ’ Queen * Ayesha was absent on Haj for a part of the yeaf; and is said to have been much gratified by the notice taken of her there as a result of a letter of good offices given by Colonel Barrett. Shaikh Hamad bin Isa, the Deputy Ruler has oeen on the best of terms with the Agency throughout the year. His distaste of work in any form is increasing and it is becoming more and more difficult to get him to make a decision. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa has been of great assist- -ance to the Bahrain Government. He has more push and go than all the rest of his family put together, and since he exerting his influence more and more on the side of good Government, much is to be noped of him in the future. Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa returned from Lingah in January and was obliged to part with his gold watca and other bribes to avoid taking out a Persian jawaz. Later he went to India for three months and spent most of the time at Bombay. He was given a free trip to Rangoon by the B.I.S. N. Company which he much enjoyed. As President of tne mamm Municipal Committee he is quite useless, more from mental incapacity than anything else. Shaikh Salman bin Hamad has been doing steady and useful work as Joint Magistrate and Judge of the Bahrain Court. He is hard working and sensible and will make a useful Judge when he has more confidence. Shaikhm Shaildi Rashid bin Muhammad, the father-in-law of Shaikh Hamad has become President of the Majlis el Urfi, an v is doing well. Certain other members of the Al Khalifah family have been employed in posts of lesser importance. BAHRAIN STATE . Captain Parke went on leave on the 21st March and retume d on the 12th October* In his absence, Mr. Belgrave carried out the duties of Commandant of Police. On the whole Sunni-Shiah relations have been satisfactory throughout the year, but in Muharrum it was reported that the Persians in Muharra^ had commenced hold ing processions, and were behaving in a provocative manner. The *olitical Agent re nested them to desist and they did so. A result of the persecution of Bahama* at Muhanmerah has been to estrange Banrsin Shiahs from Persian Shiahs, and the two communities have little in common now. Ali bin Abdullah and Ali bin Jafar were appointed Shiah adhis, the former for the town of manama and the l&amp;tM Wm for the villages. During May an agitation was set on footto bring about the return of Shaikh Ihalaf the ex-Shiah i^dhi, now at Kerbelja. The agitation was ignored and eventually . subsided. IIsailimkEfimMMrid-JtMt It will be remembered that the Bahrain Government attempted three years ago to form Waif Committees but were obliged to give up the idea on account of the outcry raised. The Shiahs voluntan- -ly decided to form one in May and it has done excellent work. Many unsuspected lapfs have been discovered, ana an income of some 50,000 rupees has already been secured. The outstanding event of the year in the internal affairs of the State were the trial of certain members of the Al Khalifah family for offences committed between 3 and . 88 years ago# By a stroke of lucj: the Police had Been able to lay their hands on a gang of men who had carried out many mur derous attacks on Bahrain villages, and being* foreigners, the had been sentenced in the Agency Court to life sentences. It was conclusively shown that they had been instigated to these acts by certain kt Khalifah, ana since it was most undesirable that the instigators should escape scot free, Shaikh Hamad was pressed to deal with them. This he was very loth to do, buf'patience will subdue tigers and Numidian lions”, and he finally allowed the Bahrain Court to take up the cases.^Shaikh Abdullah was added to the Court, and all three^were found guilty. Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khlid was convicted of instigat ing the attempt on Shaikh Hamd’s life three years ago, but Shaikh Hamad curiously took no action on the Court’s decisi. and the would be assasin shortly afterwards went to live with him at Sakhir# Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah al Ghattam was convicted of instigating and being present at the attack on Farsia m which two of his tenants were murd red. He was made to pay/ r 7500blood money. Shaikh Hamad bin Subah was convicted of having instigated the murderous attack on his tenants in the village of Tubli, and was sentenced to pay two blood 1 monies, or 1600 dollars. He was also depriveo of his post of President of the Commercial Court. These trials cannot fail to have an excellent effec as they constitute the first occasion on which any of the Al Khalifah have had their crimes brought home to them. The Bahrain Court, as the instrument of justice has had its prestige immeasurably enhances. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa was most useful during the trials and the results were largely due to his efforts. mr. nnwnRSSIOH .

On the 15th March the Manama Shiah school was opened, and a Boys school in Hedd and a new Girls school in Manama have been opened. The despa tab ii oi 7 boys to beirut University at entirely disproportionate cost of one third of the total education budget has not proved a great success and | is probable that some will not toe *ept on taere. She boys were not selectee for intellectual attainments, ana are far too backward U usnefit by University training. The American Mission maintained two day schools, on for boys and the other for girls. The girls school suffered from the opening of a Government girls school and lost almost ' all its pupils. The Rev. Mr. Hakken also takes night classes in English. ym.IGE FORCE . The members of the India 'olice dwindles to 85, and Arabs were maintained at B4. A force of some 150 naturs or night-watchmen also exists. Public security has been good throughout the year, except for a demonstration of 206 divers at Muharraq demanding increased advances and a A.; • ‘ at Hedd over two boys of easy virtue. There were k*xxxx 201 prisoners in the State Jail during the year, a marked decrease on former years• The year was a poor one for the pearling industry. The catch was good, ( one remarkable peirl worth over a lakh being found ) but the leading buyers combined to keep prices down, and the slum in Wall Street had a disastrous effect on sales after the season. Merchants who took their perispearls to India are not ‘believed to have sold half of them, and it is feared that conditions may be nExtworse next year.

The prices have come down in the boat building in dustry, and a number of launches were made. Kelvin engines upto 72 H.P. are successfully put into locally made hulls, and appear quite satisfactory. 130 British and 10 Oennan ships entered the port , during the year, as compared with 96 British and 7 Oeniian \ vessels during the past year. The increase in British ships is principally due to the more frq^uent arrival o^ Strick Ellerman vessels, the Persian Customs difficulties having made transhipment at Bunder Abbas impossible. The change is all to the advantage of Bahrain, and though the Strick cargoes are not heavy, they will no doubt increase. The S.S. Barenfels of the Hansa Line ran aground on the Pasht Adhbal. This is the third stranding on this reef in three years, and a powerful light is urgently required either on the Pasht Adhbal or somewhere on the 10 fatnom line ^ to tne north of it. The tonnage of the vessels entering Banrai is a quarter of the tonnage of vessels entering the port of Basra ( excluding Abadan ) but though the Basra lights are innumerable Bahrain has but two.

The following items were of interest to Bahrain * , In April al Hithlain was treacherously take by Fahad bin Jiluwi and killed. In May Fahad himself was killed . together with 600 of his followers, and his camp looted by the Ajmsn. Bin Jiluwi was overwhelmed by the news and evidntly received some fora of mental stroke, for a trustworthy observer considered him permanently affected. He recovered towards the end of thebyear. Between the 18th and 23rd June 3000 boxes of ammunition and £700 rifles arrived for Bin Saud sola to him by the Government of India. In August fiffir Saud came to replace Bin Jiluwi, and seven offers stuck in the Dahana. He oeme on ahead with the only one to cross, but the others were attacked and burnt by Ajman. He stayed in Hofuf till November when his father recalled him, on account it is said of the 400,000 dollars he had managed to spend. The persecution of Bahama at Qatif createc. an unpleasant impression at the close of tne year, and the impotence of His Majesty’s Government to help them has undoubtedly diminished our prestige. As aresult of tne representations of Captain Fletcher the persecution oi Bahama at Mohammerah died down in September.

The desire of certain members of SalaijUta tribe to leave Bohah for Bahrain threatens to break the long esta blished friendship between Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh .Abdullah. The relations between Shaikh Abdullah and Bin oaud remain good. The former places little reliance on His Majesty T s Qovernment and pays a handsome retaining fee to Bin Saud yearly to be on the safe side. SLAVEES . 27 slaves were manumitted during the past year. CLIMATE . The summer was cool for later than usual, but the w^ih^r did not cool till later than usual. 2.10 inches of rain fell during the year. Owing to the rebellion and opening^of Nejd , ^he arrival of the Royal Air Force and the Heajaz Air Farce, 4 and the multitu^cTus additions to the days work , the Agency has carried on with the greatest difiieulty curing past year.

U^ ^ /ive thP hoi honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE BAHRAIN AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1930. PERSONNEL . Captain G.G.Frior held charge of the Agency throughout the year. Khan Bahadur Saiyid Sidaiq^ Hasan proceeded on leave to India on the 1st April 1930 and returned on the 3rd November 1930. Mr.M.J.Gazdar M.B.E officiated during his absence. RULER OF BAHRAIN ANL THE aL KHALIFA FAMILY . Shaikh Sir bin Isa has been more friendly in his attitude whether through good will or senile decay it is hard to say. He is slightly deafer than before but otherwise time leaves no mark on him. Shaikh Hamad has been on excellent terms with the Agency throughout the year. He has showed signs of being more able to stand on his own feet,and needless to say has received every encouragement to do so. His health suffered a relapse partly owing to the absence of Dr.Holmes,Dr Todd being less successful in persuading him to take his medicines. Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa has rendered useful services to the Government as Minister of Education and the brunt ol tne agitation in the schools fell on his snoulders. lie showed^r however, an inclination to take hunting trips to the mainland leaving the Adviser to grapple with the more arduous problems. He was nearly drowned on returning from one,his launch oeing caught in a storm. Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa took the customary summer holiday to the Lebanon. He feels unable to take tnis holiday wit^ouu explaining his decaying health for weeks beforehand,now saying that one side of his face has become larger than the other,now saying that if his skin is indented by pressure it retains the mark both of which he considers very serious symptoms. If he were not President of the Manama Municipality his futility would2. would be of no interest,but his incapacity is a serious drag on Shaikh Salman bin Hamad continues to do useful work as Joint Judge in the Bahrain Gourt^. Allegations are occasionally integrity# Some of the merchants are beginning to allude to him openly as the 'Heir Apparent' though he has not,of course,been recognised as such by His Majesty ! s Government# Shaikh Rashid bin Muhammad las done well as President of the Majlis al Urfi. Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad has been made Joint Magistrate on the Lower Bahrain Court and shows promise,and if he can over come his laziness will do well. Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad was taken by the Political Agent to India to have his eyes attended to# It was discovered by his Indian tutor that he was on the point of going blind through want of attention,and the provision of proper glasses has made a marked difference to him# Shaikh Hamad T s callous indifierence to his son’s obvious disability was a regrettable feature and some pressure was required before the boy was allowed to leave Bahrain. The Political Agent arranged for him to make a short tour in Rajputana,and he was much impressed by what he saw. He * was surprised that Government did not hang Mr Gandhi,and on being pressed to buy khaddar said 'Why should I buy inferior cloth? My father is a Shaikh I ’’ BAHRAIN STATE . Mr. de Grenier,Director of Customs,proceeded on leave on 1st April and returned on 1st October# A serious quarrel arose between Mr de Grenier anti the Amir of Manama for which the Matter was mainly responsible and peace was restored with some difficulty. tne useiulness ol the promier mu n icipality heard against him but the iidviser has a high opinion of his3. m Captain ar^ie took leave on urgent private affairs to settle his father T s estate,starting on 9th December and returned | on the 3rd March 1931, Mr.Belgrave performed the duties of Director of Customs in addition to his own duties. Bahr ain Police Force . The Indians had dwindled to 70 and the local police increased to 39 at the close of the year. There is also a force of naturs or night watchmen,numbering 65 and 40 respectively and there are also a few at Rifa T a. There is a defence scheme in existence against an outside raid,and the arrangements apparently consist of withdrawing all Police to the Port,leaving the Foreign community to have their throats cut by the invaders. Sunni-Shiah relations improved,and owing to the cessation of complaints from the Bahama, at Muhammera the relations between the Persian Shiahs and Bahama more or less became normal Shaikh Abdulla and Sakai Shaikh Ali bin Hasan continued to be the Shiah Qadhis and the three Abdul Latifs the Sunni Qauhis. A young Alim, Muhammad al Madani,a former clerk of the late Shiah Qadhi Muhammad al Madani aspires to the position of Qadhi and has unfortunately been allowed to practise rights which are the exclusive previlege of the appointed Qadhis. There was some agitation for the return of Shaikh Khalaf but it was ignored and subsided. / The sentences on the three Al Khalifa mentioned in last year ! s report have undoubtedly had a good effect and have done much to strengthen the hands of the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Court. It may be taken that the power of the Al Khalifa to commit serious crime with impunity has been,let us hope, broken for ever.OIL CONCESSION . xiiajor Lolmes arrived on the 15th April and was followed by two American geologists,Messrs Taylor and Davies,a month later. They left again on the 21st of July,and without making any definite statement,for obvious reasons but are understood to have been optimistic in the possibilities of finding oil at Bahrain. The lolitical Agent detected a clause in the Oil Concession that gave the Company^to indemnify tliemselves for any losses of whatever nature by deducting them from payments due to the Bahrain Government. The injustice of this clause was pointed out and the Political Agent requested that the Shaikh should be advised not to agree to the Assent transferring the Eastern and General'S concession to the American interests until this clause had been modified. He was supported by the Residency and the Colonial office obtained a letter modifying the clause from the American combine. ARTESIAE AEllC . * A check has been put on the indiscriminate sinking of artesian wells but far too much water is still being wasted. Shaikh Hamad has sunk a very successful well near the sea coast at Qarzekhan on the western shore of tue island,but it will be a long time before all the water can be utilized. The Government sank a well on the open ground near f All but the water was sulphurous and two other attempts failed. It is unfortunate tiiat the only unclaimed land near Manama is unsuitable for artesian wells. AGRICULTURE . On the recommendation of the Political Agent an agriculturist was engaged from T Iraq. He appears exactly the type of man wanted,and all the big date garden owners consult him freely. He gives lectures at the schools and takes the boys out for practical training. In the days of Ibn Batuta Bahrain was famous for its cotton,and there is no reason why it should not be grown again.: The Bahrain dates are apparently of good quality but badly tended. At present the Island is entirely dependent on the pearl trade tor a living,and if agriculture was properly developed it would prove a valuable second string,but until some opportunity is given to the shamefully rachrented peasantry to enjoy the fruits of improvements made in their holdings,progress will be difficult. CUSTOMS HDVEmiBS . The total Customs’ collections for the year amounted to Rs.7,90,107/-. MUHICIPALITIBS * Revenue has fallen off,apart from halving the subsidy paid by the G-overnment to the Manama Municipality,and all suggestions for raising the house rates (which were recently reduced by half) were met with no enthusiasm. The councillors are almost all owners of house property and are averse to any form of taxation on buildings,or indeed any tax that affects them personally. Much street widening has been done in both Manama and Muharraq,and some town planning has been done to the south of the former. Despite the strict prohibition on all forms of intoxicants, liquor is constantly finding its way into the towns,and is usually distilled from dates. The Police made several important captures,but so long as the demand exists there will be a supply The offenders are mostly all ’Iraqis. PUBLIC WORKS . No large works were undertaken owing to the necessity for economy,but some work was done on the Manama-Mukarraq causeway, mainly as a form of outdoor relief, ihe road was originally planned to be forty feet wide,but as the Political Agent pointed out that it would be completed in half the time and cost nearlyhalf as much ii it was made twenty feet wide,without materially detracting from its usefullness,the width has now been reduced to that figure. EDUCATION . The new Inspector of Education has been a great success, but undoubtedly showed too great a tendency to model the schools on the Beirut system,and introduced English into all except the very lowest forms. The Political iigent drew attention to this and suggested that the schools should model themselves on Baghdad and Basra,and not on Beirut,and,since the indigenous boy is not very intelligent,urged that time should not be taken up with English until he had obtained a good grasp of his own language. Effect had been given to his suggestions,but unfortunately in early February the abuses that had been discovered by the Inspector determined the two headmasters of the Manama and Muharraq Sunni schools to provoke a crisis and get rid of him at all costs. Without warning,they suddenly dismissed the boys after making most objectionable and subversive speeches,and closed the schools. Next day when summoned by Shaikh Abdulla, the Minister of Education, they did not appear but sent a list of demands,which included re nests that the Inspector should have no authority to inspect schools,ana that no changes should be made in the staff T s pay,and that appointments should be permanent. They were informed that no discussion could take place until they returned to work,but they replied that until each demand had been granted they would remain on strike. The other masters and the boys paraded, the town,causing considerable excitement,but after the dismissal of the Head masters peace was restored. On the return of tne headmasters to they immediately launched a venomous campaign against the Agency in the press,no doubt considering it better copy than abusing Shaikh Abdulla who actually ordered their dismissal. The masters had been emboldened in their attitude by tne open support of Yusuf Fakhru and Khan Baiiadur Abdul Aziz Qusaibi.andpart of the propaganda employed was to say that religious instruction was being displaced in favour of English- Actually the number of forms in which English was taught had just been reduced and the religious teachers themselves admitted that no alteration had been made in their curriculum. Neither the Eadd or Hifa’a schools took part in these disturbances,and all the Shiah T s held aloof. The Government girls schools are doing well,and altogether some five to six hundred boys and girls are receiving free State instruction. All the boys at Beirut University were withdrawn at the end of the school year. It will be recalled that they were sent tnere without any selection on either mental or moral grounds, nor had any undertaking been taken that they would work for the Government on their return. They appear to have profited nothing by their stay at Beirut,in fact a less suitable place could scarcely have been chosen for boys from a primitive place like Bahrain,and on their return they refused point blank to work for the Government with^ one or two except ions, who mentioned some exorbitant figure 4s the least remuneration they could accept. They have learnt very little and show no sign of gratitude for the large sums spent on them and all the State has to show for an expenditure ol over half a lakh is a. xew young men with wind in the head. The American mission maintained two schools. f ihe boys school had a maximum enrolment of 76,and also neld night classes, and the girls school a maximum enrolment of 107,though about half this number would be the average attendance. The new Government girl T s school has not affected the attendance at tne Mission’s girls’ school,in spite of the fact that they have contributed most of its pupils and a teacher. The American Mission deserve every credit for the pioneer work they have done for female educ4tion in Bahrain. The Herd -ir Hakken's ardent evangelism caused some excitemeni and the Political ^ent advised him to abate his zeal if he wishec8 , fa'?'? l i_ £-4-. wished to remain in Bahrain. TRADB . ihe year proved disastrous for the Pearling industry and. consequently tor Bahrain,pearls reaching some 30^ of their 1929 value. Ihe catch was above the average but tnere was next to no buying. Practically the wnole of the season T s catch remained . * unsold except for the cheaper qualities which were bought fairly freely,and the year ? s sales amounted to only some 28 or 30 lakhs. Jlext year T s prospects are even gloomier. The reforms in the diving industry continue to exercise a most beneficial xnlu influence and there is little doubt that a far greater proportion of the divers now understand the advantage of keeping out of debt. Even Qatar has been obliged to follow suit and institute divers books,and since the obscure mamifica- aJr tions of diving finance oblige many divers and boat owners Qatif and Dammam to take all their advances from Bahrain,they have to bind themselves to Bahrain terms and rules. The total value of the trade of the year amounted to Hs.2,53,00,480 as compared vdth Rs.4,04,45,915 in the preceeding year. The total value of imports amounted to Rs.1,60,37,490 as against Rs.2,67,51,467 in the preceeding year. The exports amounted to Rs.9,26,29,990 as against Rs.1,36,94,448 for the preceeding year. The figures for exports are not accurate since few of the pearls exported are declared at their proper value if declared at all. i BOAT BUli^ING . Eighteen new motor launches were built in Bahrain of which six were exported,and six old craft were fitted with engines. Fifty-five new sailing boats were built in Bahrain of which four were exported. The engines used are almost invariably Kelvins. One hundred and twenty-three British ships and eleven German ships entered the port as compared with one huncred and thirty and ten last year. The Strick vessels are bringing more cargo9. ^ than Dei ore, ana Bahrain now fills the place of Bandar Abbas as a transhipment port for the Gulf. BLBCTRIC LIGHT . Ihe electric power station was opened b/ Shaikh Hamad on the 12th May* BANKRUPTCIES . Two very large bankruptcies took place in the year,that of the A1 Baqar Brothers and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Sharif who absconded to Persia leaving debts of over three lakhs,two lakhs being due to the ilansa line whose agent he was,and whom he had swindled by allowing himself and his son to take delivery of goods without retiring the bills of lading. A suggestion was made for the establishment of a Chamber of Commerce but the idea fell through owing to lack of support from the Shaikhs. flcrtjjui JYcL^nj Several visits were paid by His Majesty f s Ships,and on the 27th November Rear Admiral E.J.A.Sullerton,Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station arrived for a two da/s visit. Shaikh Hamad I invited him to go hawking and both weather and sport combined to make his visit a success. Admiral Eeville paid a visit in the Diana arriving on the both December and leaving on the 2nd January. ROYAL Aih FORCE . j The Royal Air Force entered their new Rest house in June, and the negotiations regarding the aerodrome have been concluded. | The Political Agent made a number of flights with the R.Afduring the year,including a crash amongst his experiences. J'iork on the petrol tank at Yas was begun towards the end of November,but owing to various circumstances the project was not completed before the year closed. THE HEEJAZ AIR FORCE . This ill assorted body arrived at tne close of the preceedingyear,^no. ivlarcn oegan to be a th;rn in the sine of the Political Agent, k disgraceful orgy resulted in the dismissal of one pilot attd after prolonged unpleasantness,and the timely removal of the arn iorce to Jedda in August alone prevented another pilot and two oi the mechanics sharing the fate of the first pilot# By their actions,this Force did an immense amount of harm to our prestige,and their departure was haileci witn profound relief by the whole of the British community. POST OFFICE# This ^ost office does not deliver letters at the residence of addressees. Buring the year 4499 Registered letters were received and 4097 despatched a slight reduction on last year T s numbers. 4991 parcels were received and 489 despatched and PtS.9055 worth of stamps sold.

The number of Civil suits filed in the Agency were 1957,an increase of 25^ on last year,and criminal cases 350,an increase of over 15,The total number of petitions registered were2584 as compared with 1949 during the past year. The year was a record one both from the point of view of cases heard and fees collected, and the latter more than pay for the whole of staff except the Political Agent. An extra clerk has been applied for to cope with the extra work,ana without his assistance it will be impossible to carry on. MEDICAL . Assistant Surgeon R.Holmes proceeded on leave and was replaced by Dr.N.C.Todd. Mrs.Todd died on the 11th eptember from heart failure.11 . Th.6 total number of cases were 1930. 1929. Outdoor patients. 9153 7289 Indoor patients. 257 276 Major and Minor operations. 435 787 An influenze epidemic raged in the first part of the year furtner deaths occurred at Calali from malaria. Some progress was made with vaccination and the population seem to becoming aware of its advantages. Dr and Lrs holmes returned on the 14th December. Dr.Hoimes is very popular and it is entirely due to his influence that Bahama wcmen are beginning to make use of the hospital. They are Shiahs and will not go to the Mission hospital if they can possibly avoid it. The American Mission maintains two hospitals,one for men and one for women. In spite of the frequent absences of Dr.Dame the former had 31,384 cases,including 431 in patients and 36o and 439 major and minor operations respectively. The women T s hospital had 8308 in patients,255 in patients and 125 major and minor operations. The departure of Dr. Rothchaefer had a bad effect on this hospital as the new Lady Doctor does not inspire the same confidence. VISITS OF GOVEMENT OFFICIALS. The Lon T ble Lt Col.H.V.Biscoe,Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,accompanied by Major T.C.*,.Fowle and Air Vice , arshai Sir Robert and Lady Brooke Popham arrived at Bahrain on the 4th February,leaving by the Patrick Stewart the same day. Colonel Biscoe also visited Bahrain on the 31st June and 17th July,in the first case by Southampton and in the second by ftq Cyclamen. The Cyclamen received a severe buffeting on her way from Las al Khaimeh to Bahrain. He paid a final visit to Bahrain from the 8th to 11th November accom.j&amp;nied by /ir.Blanchi in tae fatrici Stewart and the Senior Naval Officer in the Patrick Stewart.12. ^ 7n? J Captain R.L.Q^Connor,officer on special dut/,paid two 'TZ&amp;j visits to iiaiirain stc ying about five weeks with the Politic? 1 Agent, Captain Prior paid two visits to Qatar in the year and also visited the mainland. Two Persian Shaikhs,Shaikh Muhammad al Hum and Shaikh Maahkur of Gaobandi visited Bahrain during the year. The former came to borrow money off Shaikh Hamad and the latter to collect uebts ia due to him. Both asked the Political Agent for dritish help and both were told that nothing* couid be done to help them. MEJD . The outstanding event of tne year was the visit of His Majesty King ibn Sa f ud to Bahrain. He left Ras Tanurah on the 20th February and landed at Bahrain on the 25th after the conclusion of the Lupin conference. He received an amazing ovation on his arrival,the Shaikhs having gone out to meet him as soon as the steamer was sighted. As luck would have it the Political Agent received a message from the Residency announcing that he was not coming and specially went to-Shaikh Isa,who was awaiting him at the Pa la nee to tell him so. As Bin Sa T ud landed almost immeciately afterwards a most unfortunate impression was created. Al together, from the point of view of the British connection the visit was a disaster,and nothing could have demernstrated more exactly the tenuity of our hold on Banrein. The Political Agent visited Qatar on the 22nd January and returned on tne 24th. The Amir, Muhammad bin Suwailim was friendly and useful results were obtained. It was clear that the accounts received in Bahrain of the oppression of Bahama had been exaggerated,and even the subsequent reports of other atrocities were found to be in most cases untrue. The situation continued to be de&amp;idate,however, and Bahrain,and strangly enough the Phaikhs who take little interest in Phiahs were much excited over our apparent inability to protect Bahrain interests. As a result of the Political Agent’s negotiations with the Amir * probably as a result of discovering that His Majesty’s Govewere onl^ interested in genuine Bahama and had no intention of asserting any protection over those who had no claim to Bah rain nationality,the Uajd Government finally appeared to accept tne situation. In £fc.y,a genuine Bahraini named Ahmad bin Abbas who had been imprisoned by them was released,an act which called forth the gratitude of his relatives to the British Government, whom they considered responsible. Continued efforts were made to find water by boring at Ras i lanurahjbut fortunately sand was encouiitered which defeated all efforts. If water were to be found there, it would be a compara tively simple matter to establish a port and a large proportion of the Bahrain trade would be diverted. The Qusaibis were in an even stronger position at the close of the year,and so long as they continue to do the lion ! s share of the mainland trade,the favour of their royal master will have little effect on their great and growing power in Bahrain. On two occasions,they took advantage of the Political Agent’s absence to commit arbitrary acts which showed unmistakeably the position they would assume if they were allowed to become Bin Baud’s official representatives in Bahrain,or if the hold of the Agency weakened. Bin Sa’ud wrote a most objectionable postscript to a letter he sent to Shaikh Hamad in which he complained of the injustice done his subjects and threatened the Shaikh with the wrath of ’his friends’ no doubt referring to His Majesty’s Government. Shaikh Hamad and the Ruling Family were somewhat nettled by this letter,and Shaikh Hamad replied equally brusquely tuat he had heard of no complaints from Bin Ja’ud’s subjects and invited him to say what they were. Bin Jiluwi recovered sufficiently to take over the Governorship of Hasa and in August made an attempt to get uhaikh Hamad to send him for decision a case ot theft wnich occurred in Bahrain harbour. in October Muhammad at Tawil’s commission arrived and proceeded to tighten up financial control to the intense an of the usaibis and Ajajis.X r x } Tiie Political Agent was able to avert the impending quarrel between Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasiin al I'hani and Sliaikh Hamad over Salaita. Shaikh Hamad was persuaded to return one who had some claim to Bahrain nationality,so that he might regulate his debts and at the same time/^secured an unofficial guarantee that the man would not be harmed. Bahrain,with its good Government and increasing number of capitalists,acts as a lodestone to labour in the surrounding territories,and there is no doubt that others will leave their homes and migrate to Bahrain whether their rulers like it or not. Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim exerted himself to rescue a young Persian Baluch who had been caught by slavers and brought to Qatar for sale. He was sent to Bahrain and repatriated to his home near Bandar Abbas. Qatar shares the prevailing depression to a greater degree than Bahrain,and customs have dropped by 50^• Shaikh Abdulla showed some signs of desiring a greater degree of protection from His ;«ajesty T s Government but finding no enthusiasm for closer contact on their part has not pursued the matter with vigour. SLAVERY . Eighteen slaves were manumittec curing tue year. A traffic in woman from Halabar to Bahrain came under notice curing the year. Some women were repatriated and others assisted to find husbanas. Steps have been taken to check this trade. Difficulty is experienced in dealing witn the victims as very few persons here speak their language and recent arrivals ~ know no d&amp;xah Arabic. 3L1MAT, xte .year was a not one,and the cold weather very late in arriving. 1.93 inches of rain fexl during the ^ear.The close of the year found the Agency English office^ in a state of chaos owing to the shortage of staff, the extra English oi f ice clerk asked for in June 1j3Q not arriving till January 1131 • in tact,but for the immense energy 'and devotion to duty of kr.Gazdar,both as Head Clerk and officiating Indian Assistant, the English office would have ceased to function. It is now the turn of the Vernacu&amp;ar office to re nire assistance,ana an extra clerk has been asked for to help with the increasing work. The number of cases has increased by 25 /; / and at the close of the year it was found impossible to keep up with political work. The closing stages of the Nejd rebellion provided a great deal of work,and a great deal of time of the staff was taken up in the purely mechanical work of decoaing messages,one ten page message froia the Colonial Office for Bin Sa T ud occupying the Head Clerk ana First kunshi for two whole days,owing to corrupt groups and the necessity for an accurate translation. If the extra vernacular clerk is not provided chaos will ensue. An Assistant Political Agent will also soon be needed, if the Political Agent is to have any time to meet Arabs. The close of the year saw British prestige higher than the year before. The release of a prominent Bahraini at Qatif,due it was supposed,to the efforts of the British Government had a fcery good effect,and the lack of persecution at Muhammera was favourably notec. Internal disorders were few,and Shaikh Hamad showed a disposition to assert himself more,in which he received the warmest support from the agency. In iact but for tue appalling slump in the pearl raarket,the year would have oeen satisfactory.
