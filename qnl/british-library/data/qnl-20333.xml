The Government of India while noting your view as to the improbability of the visit taking place, are of opinion that the matter is sufficiently serious to justify immediate action^.end they are inclined to th:nk that the best way of exercising pressure on bin Saood / with a view to pre- . venting the visits, might be through the channel of the Sheikh of T - r oweit who controls, to a large extent the supply arms fcr . jjd ivhici. must stiT; oe a matter of importance to bin Saood.0(121: 3, Tht Political Agtnt at Tr owtit is, thtrefort, authoristd, unless you see any objection, to make enquiries of Sheikh Mubarak as to the facts.

From—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In reply to Foreign Department letter No. 444)1-E.

Even allowing a modicum of discount upon the views expressed by Sheikh Mobarek, the probability is that they are primarily well founded. At the same time the question of the spread of Wahabi influence is one with regard to which we need to maintain a very vigilant attitude, and I should have addressed Government on the subject on my recent return from Beraimi had I not found the Foreign Department letter under reply, awaiting me at Bushire. 3. The Sheikh of Abu Thabi at a confidential interview which he asked me to ^ive him on the Lawrence spoke to me very strongly on this question. The Government of India will have learnt from paragraph 2 of Captain «• ^^ Trevor's previous communication that r*o. 518, Qfttod 29th October 190d» cti~ *1 'l. r7 j ca * _ M t j* i . i. j Sheikh Zaeed was sufficiently disturbed by bin Saood's missive to proceed to Maskat and discuss the situation with the Sultan, and I found him still much exercised at heart. It is not surprising that being, as he is, the leader of the Hinawi element in Northern Oman (as the Sultan of Maskat is further south), and having been himself instrumental in the final extinction of Wahabee influence from Beraimi and the Pirate Coast in 1870, Sheikh Zaeed, and his kinsman the Sheikh of Debai, should regard the contingency of the appearance of bin Saood with much anxiety. 4. Nor is there, on the other hand, much cause for wonder if, as is the case, the Ghafiri Section of the Trucial Chiefs, that is to say, all except Abu Thabi and Debai, should regard bin Saood's overtures with favour, if not with pleasurable excitement. An indirect result of them has been that Shargah and Hamriyeh, and Shargah and Umm-el-Kowein, who have respectively for a long time been on strained terms, have lately made the support of the Beni Katab Bedouins in a quarrel with Sheikh Zaeed on the Beraimi side, an occasion for reconciliation among themselves, as Ghafiris, for united resistance to Sheikh Zaeed, whom, as the most powerful Chief on the Coast and as a Hinawi, they regard with jealousy and distrust. I did my best to impress upon Sheikh Zaeed the folly of inducing a com bination of the other Sheikhs against himself by proceeding to extremities with the Beni Katab, and I am glad to hope from the Besidency Agenfs recent reports that he has found a pacific solution of his quarrel with them ; so that ^ any cause for actual unrest is for the present removed; I think, however, that I have said enough to show that the progress of bin Saood's fortunes will be keenly watched on the Pirate Coast by all parties. 5. Sheikh Zaeed was very anxious that the Government of India should take steps to prevent any movement of bin Saood towards the Pirate Coast, and that imperative orders should be issued to the Ghafiri Sheikhs not to intrigue with him. Beyond the sign which we have already made through Sheikh Mobarek, as now reported, there seems little else that we can do at present, but if the Govern- ^ ment of India approve, I see no objection to my giving all the Trucial Sheikhs, ■ both Ghafiri and Hinawi, to understand that on the grounds that general unrest f prejudicial to our commercial interests on the Coast would inevitably result, I lthe Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with bin Saood. The existing impression on the Trucial Coast undoubtedly is that as long as bin Saood restricts his movements to the land, the British Government will as heretofore refrain from interfering in any way; but the political situation has been so much modified in the last 35 years, that I can hardly think that in regrard to the present problem a strict adherence to tradition would be a safe policy for us to pursue. I beg to be favoured with the views and instructions of Government as early as may be possible. No. 97, dated 17th January 1906. From— Major P. Z.

I have the honour to forward a copy of a communication from the Govern- XT aaai t? t&gt; v mnK ment of India, regarding the reported No 4441-E. B., dated 5th December 1905. ^ i j . • •- .1 Vi* a . ambition of bm Saood to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman. This was one of the matters which I had hoped to discuss with you personally at Busrah last week, but as you know, I was prevented from proceeding there at the last minute. 2. The position is briefly this:— Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Kahman has shown by letters which he has addressed to some of the Trucial Chiefs that he has some idea of attempting to re-establish the old Wahabee influence which his forefathers formerly acquired in Oman and of paying a preliminary visit to the Pirate Coast in connection with that aspiration. His interference in the affairs of the Trucial Chiefs or with subjects of the Sultan of Maskat would obviously be a most undesirable contingency; and the Government of India consider that our best means of preventing it is through the medium of Sheikh Mubarak. Hence their desire that you should sound him on the subject. In order that it may not appear that we attach very great importance to the reports at present existing, it would be better that you should in the first instance discuss the matter with Sheikh Mubarak, not as if you were acting on the instructions from Government, but as if on a casual reference from me. You might tell him, as is the case, that during a tour on the Trucial Coast from which I have just returned, I heard from some of the Sheikhs that Abdul Aziz bin Saood had been writing to them about a visit which he said that he con templated paying to their country ; and then ask him if he thinks that bin Saood seriously contemplates such a thing. You could go on to say that you cannot suppose that Government would approve of any interference by bin Saood in the affairs of Chiefs in treaty relation with us, and that you would advise Sheikh Mubarak as our friend and that of bin Saood to discourage the latter from the project should bin Saood consult him in the matter. Please report as early as possible the results of your interview. No. 1, dated Camp Jahra, the 19th January 1906. From— Captain S. G. Knox, I .A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter No. 97, dated Bushire, 17th January 1906, on the subject of bin Saood's pro jected visit to the Pirate Coast and Oman. 2. This morning, I took the opportunity of discussing the matter with Sheikh Mubarak on the lines indicated at the close of paragraph 2 of your letter quoted above. 3. Sheikh Mubarak informed me that he had heard of bin Saood's plans which he regarded as a mere attempt to extort money from the various coastal chiefs; that he had written already to bin Saood, pointing out to him thea&lt;? 00219 f impolicy of a confession, on the part of a ruler, to lack of funds; and further reminding him that bin Rashid was only scotched not killed; that bin Saood's power in Nejd was anything but finally established; that he had neither funds nor transport for a policy of aggression in the direction of Oman and that the first fruits of such an attempt would be that Sheikh Mubarak would break off relations with him. 4. The Sheikh, in conclusion, said that he did not suppose that, after this letter, bin Saood would persist in his design, though Sheikh Mubarak would not undertake to answer for the opinions and policy of an ignorant savage. 6. The Sheikh and I were quite alone at this interview and I have done my best to render accurately the substance of his remarks. It would appear that Sheikh Mubarak by no means approves entirely of bin Saood ; he com plains that there is a want of system and organisation in El-Eiadh and that bin Saood is not the man to attain to the position of his forefathers. Recently, the Sheikh has been constantly complaining of the degeneracy of the Arabs and the utter want of security and order outside the limits of his own terri tories, but I have been unable, so far, to learn what recent occurrences have given rise to these complaints.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit a further report from Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, on the subject of Ibn Saood's alleged intention to risit Northern Oman, in continuation of my letter No. 51 of the 4th instant. 2. Sheikh Mubarak's suggestion that Ibn Saood's overtures to the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast are merely a plan for obtaining financial support^ (or blackmail) from them, is probably well founded, as from another communica tion in connection with Nejd affairs which I am addressing by this mail to Government, it will be apparent that his position in Nejd is so unsettled at present as to make it improbable that Ibn Saood would be in a position to turn his serious attention to the Trueial Coast. At the same time I see no objection to the issue of the admonition recommended in paragraph 5 of my last communication above quoted. 3. In regard to Sheikh Mubarak's attitude, it seems possible that his temporary disapproval of Ibn Saood is due to the fact that while his own relations with the Turks are getting more friendly, Ibn Saood's are becoming decidedly strained, and this means no doubt that the latter is less inclined than before to be guided by the Sheikh of Koweit's advice in his relations with the Porte.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my Camp No. 1, dated 19th January 1906, on the subject of Ibn Saood's projected visit to the Pirate Coast and Oman, I have the honour to inform you that Sheikh Mubarak visited me yesterday morning and of his own accord introduced this topic of conversation and informed me that he had written to Ibn Saood on the subject* lie again assured me that he had every hope that the visit would not come off and that Ibn Saood's only object was money. 2. This uncalled for return to the subject suggests to me that Sheikh Mubarak has strong objections to Ibn Saood being served by any port but Koweit and that we may reckon on Sheikh Mubarak's support in this matter.

Secretary of State for Eoreigu Affairs, copy of a furthet Secret t letter from the Government of India on the subject of a visit which the Wahabi Amir Abdul Aaiz bin Saood is reported to be intending to make to the Pirate Coast and Maskat in the coming spring. It will be observed that on the 5th December 1905, the Government of India authorised enquiries being made of the Sheikh of Koweit as to Bin Saood's intentions, but that the result has not yet been reported. In the meanwhile the Government of India, in view of the serious consequences which would ensue if Bin Saood should succeed in establishing his ascendancy over the Trucial Chiefs or the Sultan of Maskat, suggest that he should be approach ed either through the Sheikh N of Koweit or the Sultan of Maskat or other suitable channel, with a view to ascertaining whether he is prepared to stand by the declaration of his predecessor not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government. In regard to this I am to observe that the declaration made in 1866 was not proposed, or even formally accepted, by the British Government, and it contained a reference to the claim of the Wahabis upon the Customs of Maskat. The Government of India further suggest that, in the event of Bin Saood's failing to give the necessary assurance, he should be warned that any attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or on the Pirate Coast would be regarded as an unfriendly act ami that suitable measures would be taken to frustrate it. These measures, in the opinion of the Government of India, might consist either of a more stringerit embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and elsewhere, or, in the case of necessity, of actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened. \ The serious consequences which might arise from the re.establishment by Bin Saood of the Wahabi dynasty throughout t^he centre of Arabia were JEnclosure 4 to Pro.

Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople of the 16th May 1904, No. 373, and the question is further complicated if, as appears to be the case. Bin Saood has been recognised by the Turkish Govern ment and has acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sultan. It will be observed that the Government of India consider that it would be useless and undesirable to bring pressure to bear on Bin Saood through the Turkish authorities. So far as Maskat is concerned I am to observe that the Brench Government is conjointly with the British Government interested in its independence, and in the event of interference by the Wahabis with the Trucial Chiefs the measures proposed by the Government of India might not be effectives For instance, such control as we may be able to exercise over the importation of arms into Arabia is limited to arms imported by British subjects. The questions raised by the Government of India are thus complicated, and in view of 6ur desire to refrain from any entanglements with the rulers of Nejd, it seems ^desirable to take no steps, in the absence of any urgent necessity caused by Wahabi action, until His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople has been\ponsulted on the proposal to approach Bin Saood otherwise than through the vTurkish authorities, \ 19 180FD \ Jl20 The suggestion of the GoTernment of India that in the event of Bin ^aooti's failing to give satisfactory assurances a more stringent embargo should he placed upon the traffic in arms appenrs to raise a further difficulty conveying the implication that in the contrary event the Government of India would be prepared to acquiesce in the import of arms by the Sheikh of ♦ prt no, 36i in secret e., august 1904, kos.

The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, A. GODLEY. Extract from the ^Englishman' dated the 10th March 1906. The home papers give the story of a futile attempt on the part of Turkey to impress a sense of its temporal authority on Arabia. An expedition was despatched from Baghdad to Kassim in the centre of the Nezd district. The expedition reached this town without having struck a blow but through extraordinary laxity, the Turkish Government after its arrival ignored its existence. The soldiers tired of neglect began making their way back in groups to Koweit. Of the original 2,0C0 soldiers only about 150 remain at Kassim, and the effort of the Turkish Government to show its authority has only earned derision. This humiliating fiasco has done great harm of Turkish prestige in Arabia, and it makes a striking illustration of the childish ineffici ency that reigns at Constantinople.

Extract from the 'Times of India', dated 30th March 1906. With regard to Koweit Mr. Leland Buxton says there is no doubt that The Persian Gulf Imbroglio. the Sheikh of that We is playing a double game and is intriguing with the Turks. The Sheikh is now allied with Ibn Saood (one of the two most important Emirs of Central Arabia) who has just become a protege of Turkey, and there now exists a sort of Triple Alliance between this Emir, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the Turks, an alliance directed chiefly against Ibn Kashid (the second most powerful Emir of the region). As a result of this understanding the Turks have now been enabled to establish garrisons at Nejd. Mr\ Buxton says the treaty recently entered into between Lord Curzon and the 'Sheikh will prevent Koweit ever becoming a foreign naval station; but it should not be forgotten that there is also another possible harbour which would serve as the terminus of the Baghdad Railway, situated between Koweit and the mo^uth of the Shat-el-Arab river. This harbour is called Khor Abdullah; and soe^nafter the secret arrangement entered into between the Viceroy of India and the Koweit Sheikh the Turks oscupied the shore of this harbour, and it still remains in Turkish occupation. While in Baghdad Mr. Leland Buxton made special inquiries as to what extent British commerce was being affected by German competition, but found that the former was still holding its own. ''At the Persian Ports on the Gulf I was informed that the arrangement by which the Customs were placed in the hands of Belgian officials was most unpopular among the Arabs and the Persians, and that as a result of this measure the tariffs were much higher than under the old Persian regime. It appeared to be generally understood that the Belgians were carrying out this work in the interests of Russia. As the result of inquiries made in many quarters as to what extent Russian influence had been affected by the results of the late war I found that the Russian position was practically as strong as ever/' Extract from a letter from the Folitical 'Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 620, dated Bushire, the 18th {received 27th) March 1906, «**«*«« Having spent three days at Koweit during last week, I have the honour to submit, for the information of Government, a few observations regarding the present aspect of affairs there. I met Sheikh Mubarak on three occasions, and on 7th instant had a lengthy interview with him at the Agency, for the details of which I beg refer ence to the attached memorandum drawn up for me by Captain Knox who was likewise present. It will be seen that during it several topics were touched upon, some of which are subjects of separate correspondence. 2. The trend of our conversation regarding the affairs of Central Arabia, which was started by Sheikh Mubarak, is Of some significance. The possibility of the Ruler of Koweit smoking the calumet of peace with Bin Rashid, and Mubarak's own vision of a three-cornered compact between himself, Bin Rashid and Bin Saood, which would in practice probably be found to amount to a defensive alliance for resistance to Turkish expansion in Nejd and Hassa, is an interesting, if somewhat Utopian, prospect tb contemplate. It is to be feared however that Sheikh Mubarak's own ambitions, as indi cated in the second of the conditions suggested by him to Bin Rashid, are likely to form the chief obstacle to such a development. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in the course of the strife of the last few years both Bin Saood and Bin Rashid must have been brought to realise what a strong position the Ruler of Koweit, territorially situated as he is, occupies both strategically and politically in relation to them, and they evidently see the advantage of maintaining friendly relations with him. In connection with Bin Saood's doings I may remark it is possible that his recent telegram to the Porte was sent to disarm suspicion preparatory to some further move, as recent reports from Bahrein show that the Turks are now having trouble at Hofuf, in which it seems possible, if not probable, that Bin Saood has had an indirect hand. ******* Extract jrom a note of a conversation between the Resident in the Persian Gulf and Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, dated 7th March 1906.\ *»*•»*« The Sheikh informed the Resident that he thought he would be interested _ ^ , . .v . . to hear that he had lately, on 24th Feb- (1) Tl* protpects of F .c. .a the .ntenor. (29th &gt; a letter^ _ from Bin Rasbid couched in friendly language and proposing that Sheikh Mobarak should be on the same terms of friendship with him as the Kulera of KoweH had been with his uncle and grandfather before him. The Sheikh said that he had replied to Bin Rashid that he, Mubarak, was a imn who loved peace and quietness and would welcome friendly relations with him, provided that Bin Ra^hid would keep withia his own boundaries and not harass his , neighbours, and was really sincere in his desire for peace. The Resident, in the way 'of friendly interest, asked how peace could be arranged betweeh the two; whether a personal meeting would be necessary or p&lt;r whether trusted messengers would be sent. The Sheikh replied that it would be done by correspondence and that a meeting would be unnecessary. He proceeded to sketch the terms on which, in his opinion, a reconciliation between him and Bin Rashid could be consi dered practicable. ^ These were (i) That Bin Rashid should have Chhaffa (KafEa) and Hail, and the Bedouins of Jebel Shammar. (ii) That he. Bin Sabah, should have -Koweit, Aneyza, Poreyda, Sedeyr, and Washm and should control the tribes occupying them. (iii) That Bin Saood should hare Nejd and the Wadi Dowasir. ' The Resident asked if Sheikh Mobarak thought that he would be able lo keep the parties to their agreement with himself and with one another ; and the Sheikh replied that he could. The Resident then asked whether tender such circumstances Bin Rashid would have sufficient income to enable x him to live without harrying his neighbours, and Sheikh Mobarak replied that he would have Hail and Chhaffa, the Zakat of Shammar and the produce of forays on the Harb and Aneyza tribes between Hail and Medina. km' \ Asked what view the Turks would, in his opinion, take of this triple alliance, Sheikh Mobarak replied that they would undoubtedly regard it with disfavour. \ The Resident then asked whether the relations between Sheikh Mobarak (2) The relations between Bin Subah and Biu and Bill S 100d Continued the Same as Sa o o&lt; i. formerly; to which Sheikh Mobarak re plied that they did, and that Bin Saood still listened to his advice. Major Cox then thanked the Sheikh for his co-operation in ascertaining the truth regard ing Bin Saood's alleged intention to visit Oman. \ Mobarak rejoined that Sayyid Feisal of Maskat had also written to him and that he had told His Highness that there was no cause for apprehension, and that Bin Saood had quite enough to do where he was for some time to come. \ A reference was then made to the long telegram sentVfrom Bushire to 'Constantinople through Jasim Bin Thani on behalf of Bin Saood. Sheikh Mobarak was asked what inference he drew from the fact that Bin Saood had not consulted him before, and regarding its despatch. The Sheikh said that ^ he had received full details from Bin Saood's messenger, Mussad Bin Suweilim, who sent the telegram, but admitted that he had heard nothing on the subject direct from the Bin Saood family or from Abd-ur-Rahman. He thought this was because the telegram had been inspired by Sheikh Jasim Bin Thani, of whom be spoke in no very favourable terms. No. 773, dated Bushire, the 5th April 1906. From—M ajor P. Z.

It is reported that he has renewed the agreement of friendship which previously subsisted between his late father, Sheikh Ahmed, and Sheikh Zaeed. (6) As regards the Beni Kutb, the Chief of Umm el-Kowein, agreed to use bis best endeavours to induce their elders to visit the Chief of Abu Thabi and conclude an agreement with him : but if his efforts proved unsuccessful, he undertook not to support them against Sheikh Zaeed. In connection with this Sheikh Zaeed has gone out to Sumeih with his troops and is said to be awaiting the result of Sheikh Rashid's endeavours. Extract from the ' Times of h 35 dated the 9th April 1906. Fighting is reported at Ras al Khaima, between the inhabitants of that town under Sheikh Zaid and the powerful Beni Kittab Bedouin. Operations so far amount to one or two skirmishes, some desultory sniping by the Beni Kittab, and occasional looting of camels and cattle by both sides. Sheikh Zaid is preparing to take the field shortly with a largo body of towns men drawn from Umm AlKatwan, Al Ajman, and Ras Haninya in addition to his own immediate followers, the idea being to put a final stop to the Bedouin raids on the coast towns. \ The new hospital in connection with the Residency at Bahrein is rapidly approaching completion. The Arabs seem to be gradually overcoming their prejudices against these institutions, and the Mason Hospital at Bahrein built and equipped by the American Arabian Mission generally has a fair number of beds occupied. Building operations are well forward on the new Mission school and chapel, and it is hoped that the dwelling house to replace the present unsuitable and insanitary residence, will be completed before the end of the year . c, . \ MEMORANDUM.

While I quite concur in the view of the Secretary of State for India that serious complications would ensue should the Ameer succeed in establish ing his ascendancy over the Trucial Chiefs and Maskat, and that it would be well to convey to him a warning that bis action in those parts must be limited by respect for our engagement with the tribes with which we have treaties, I am disposed to think that such warning will be more effective if conveyed directly rather than through the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Maskat. As regards Mubarak, it seems fairly certain that, in view of the more friendly relations which have recently been established between him and the local Turkish Authorities of Basra,. the Porte would at once get news of our communication to Abdul Aziz, and would in all probability take steps to neutralize its effect. I would therefore suggest, for the consideration of His Majesty's Government, that our warning would be more effective if it could be arranged that a vessel of war should meet Abdul Aziz at one of the places along the coast which he proposes to visit, and he were given clearly to understand that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Trucial Chiefs will be allowed.

To The Right Hon'ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Fort William, the 11th January 1906. Sir, We have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of the correspondence detailed in the annexed list, regarding a proposed visit of Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman-bin-Saood to the Pirate Coast and Oman, and to invite • Pro. No. 218 in Secret K, June 1904, No«. 207- a reference to the correspondence ending 218. with Mr. Brodrick's Secret despatch* No. 24, dated the 29th April 1904, on the subject of our relations with the Wahabi dynasty. It will be seen that Abdul-bin-Saood, who has been staying in El Katr,. has addressed letters to the Trucial Chiefs, expressing his intention of visiting their territories in the spring; and that the Chief of Abu Dhabi has conferred personally on the subject with the Sultan of Maskat, who is much agitated at the idea that the Amir of Nejd may possibly visit Oman. His Highness considers that, should Abdul Aziz make his appearance anywhere on the shores of Oman, it would be the signal for all the Ghaferi tribes to rise against him. 2. Reports from our local officers in the Persian Gulf seem to point to the recent reassertion by the Wahabi dynasty of its former position in Nejd acquiring a permanent character. The cessation of hostilities in Nejd has left Bin Saud free to expand in other directions; and the visit of Sheikh Zaid of Abu Dhabi to Maskat shows that the situation is actually the cause of some anxiety to the Trucial Chiefs, of whom the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is the most important. We, therefore, consider it very necessary that a course of action should be concerted at an early date, so that we may be prepared for developments. On being apprised of Ibn Saood's intention to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman in the t See letter No. 4441 E.-B., dated the 5th Decern- ensuing Spring, wo directedf Major cox to ber 1905. ascertain the facts from Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit. We desire, however, to point out how very serious to our prestige and influence the consequences might be, if Ibn Saood should attack the Pirate Coast Chiefs or the Sultan of Maskat, or succeed in extending his influence over them, and how important it is that we should prevent, as far as lies in our power, such a contingency, especially now that the Wahabi Amir has recognised the suzerainty of the Sultan. 3. In our Secret despatch No. 69 (External), dated the 24th March 1904,{ t Pro. No. 215 in Secret e.. june 1904, Nos. 207- we contemplated the possibility of having 218. to revive the treaty relations w T hich existed with the Wahabi Amirs, in case Ibn Saood should succeed in establishing and extending his ascendancy. Now that the latter has come into power, and has given out that it is his intention to extend his influence towards Oman and the coast generally, it seems to us desirable to ascertain whether he is prepared tostand by the engagement of his predecessors not tooppose or injure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government. His Majesty's Government will no doubt agree with us that it would be both useless and undesirable to brinsj pressure to bear on Ibn Saood through the Turkish authorities, since his proceedings at El Hassa and in Nejd, as reported in the recent diaries from the Persian Gulf, indicate that he would not be likely to pay any attention to the remonstrances on their part; while we should be serving Turkish interests by involving ourselves in com plications with the Wahabi Amir. We would therefore suggest that, if His Majesty's Government see no objection, this enquiry be made from Ibn Saood through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit or the Sultan of Maskat or other suitable channel, and that he be warned, in the event of his unwillingness to give the necessary assurances or to declare his intentions as affecting British interests in Oman or along the Arab coast, that any attempt on his part to interfere in that locality or with the Chiefs and their subjects would be regarded as an unfriendly act, and that suitable measures would be taken to frustrate it. These might amount, in our opinion, to a more stringent embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and elsewhere on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, or even, in the case of an attack being imminent, to actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened, as might be necessary.

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of .uc . u r , India, translation of the marpinaily noted *No. 137, dated 15th September 1905, with enclosure. . i«iti • r news-letter * which I have received from the Residency Agent, Shargah, reporting, inter alia, the movements of the notorious Mohamed Abdul Wahab of Darein in Katif district. Translation of a news letter No. /J7, dated i^th September igo^, from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Major P. Z. Cox, C./.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. On the nth Jamadi Thani 1323 (13th August 1905) the Chief of Debai proceeded to the village cf Hatta for the purpose of repairing a spring for irri gation of date trees, etc. He returned to Debai on the 23rd Jamadi Thani (25th August 1905) and it appears that he has appointed one of his men, named Abdullah bin Bauker who belongs to the Lariyeh Ajam tribe to look after the spring. On the 14th Jamadl-Thani (16th August 1905) Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab arrived at Debai by the mail steamer from Bombay. When he landed at Debai from the mall steamer the Chief of Debai's locum tenens fired a salute of 2 guns and hoisted his flag on the Government House. This Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab is a merchant and deals in pearls but he is a resident of Darein in the District of Katif, and a Turkish subject. He visits Bahrein, Katr and Bombay. It appears that Mohamed bin Abdul W T ahab is the bearer of presents sent to all the Chiefs of the (Pirate) Coast from Abu Dhabi to Um-el-Kowein, by a Bania named Nakandas Jowerjin residing at Bombay. Every Sheikh has been sent a silver tray, weighing 130 miskals and one pair of Binoculars and one Brocade Shawl with a letter. I beg to forward here with a copy of one of the letters for your information. Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab arrived at Shargah on the 21st Jamadi-Thani (23 r d August 190^). The Chief of Shargah fired a salute of 2 guns and hoisted his flag on the Government House, and entertainments were given in his honour by the Chief of Shargah and some of the inhabitants of that place. He remained at Shargah for 3 days and handed to the Chief the presents sent with him by Nakandas Bania adding a small bundle containing silk cloth, Abba, (cloak) a watch, etc. He then returned to Debai. On embarking on the boat at his departure for Debai, he distributed Rs. 500 amongst the servants of the Chief of Shargah. The Chief of Ajman had sent 2 dromedaries to Mohamed. He, however, did not accept them and returned them to the Chief sending Rs. 100 as a present at same time from himself to the Chief. The Chiefs of Shargah and Debai had each sent 2 dromedaries to Mohamed Abdul Wahab. He accepted them and despatched them to Bahrein by the mail steamer. Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab tried to bring about a reconciliation between the Chief of Shargah and his uncle Sheikh Salem bin Sultan. The latter, how ever, did not agree that the reconciliation should be effected through him (Mohamed) saying 'you are a foreigner and an understanding should be made by one who should (always) be present to see that it is not infringed.' I have heard that a friendship exists between the Headman of Fujeira and Sheikh Salem bin Sultan and that the former has invited the latter to come to Fujeira as his guest and has prepared for him some presents in the shape of dates etc., and awaits Sheikh Salem's arrival at Fujeira.2 2 It appears that, if no reconciliation is effected between the Chief of Shargah and Sheikh Salem, the latter will join the Headman of Fujeira and Zed-el-Helali, the Head of Shehiyeen against the Chief of Shargah and take possession of the villages belonging to the latter in the mountainous districts of Ras-el-Kheima and Shargah. But this fact has not become public as yet. Most of the inhabitants of Shargah and Ras-el-Kheima inwardly desire to be ruled by Sheikh Salim bin Sultan. If the latter attacks Ras-el-Kheima and Shargah even with only loo men, the towns-people will join him. But Sheikh Salem is an old man and does hot like fighting and quarrels and only desires means of subsistence from the Chief of Shargah ; but the Chief does not agree to grant him the same and, I think, that, if the case remains in this state, Sheikh Salem will take some measures to involve the Chief in trouble. Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab gave Sheikh Salem bin Sultan $400 and 20 bags rice as a present. Translation of a letter&gt; dated 15th Jemadi-ul-Awal 1323 {igth July 1905) from Nakandas Jowerjin to the Sheikh, You have of course heard the news of the marriage of (my) son Subbagh. We have sent marriage gifts to some of our friends. As you are one of the most respectable friends of ours, we send you, through Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdul Wahab Pasha a present, viz., a silver tray and a pair of binoculars which I request you to accept and oblige us. My son Subbagh sends you salaams.8 Extract from the Diary of the Persian Gulf Political 'Residency for the week ending 15th {received 23rd) October 1905. ******* Shargah. 13. 5th October 1905* —Abdul Aziz Ibn Saood has addressed letters to the Trucial Chiefs in which he annouDces his visit to El Katr and his having effected reconciliation between the El Murrah, Beni Ilajir and Ajman tribes.

The latter is Sultan bin Naser Sweidi whom Sheikh Zaeed hasJffl n tryi ng to settle at Zoara (a disputed peninsula between mml ikh Zaeed's mother was a relative of Sultan bin Naser. 2. The Chiefs of Shargah, Ajman and Um-el-Kowein came to Debai to see Sheikh Zaeed, and matters about which there were disagreements between them, were discussed. Sheikh Zaeed asked the Chief of Um-el-Kowein to refrain from entering into any relations with the Bedouins, assuring him that if he was afraid of them, he would support him, against them. The Chief of Um-el-Kowein, though he inwardly wishes to maintain his relations with the Bedouins, especially the Beni Kutb, has accepted Sheikh Zaeed's advice. The Chiefs then returned to their territories where they were visited by Sheikh Zaeed later on. * * * EL • 3 * • * No. 515, dated Bushire, the 29tli October 1905. From— Captain A. P.

I have now heard that Sheikh Zaeed-bin-Kalifah duly visited Maskat and that the Sultan is much agitated at the idea that the Amir of Nejd may possibly visit Omaa. His Highness considers that should Abdul Aziz make his appearance anywhere on the slioros of Oman, it would be the signal for all the Ghaferi tribes to rise against him. 3. I think it is unlikely that Bin Saood will endeavour to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman, but the appearance of the Wahabi Amir in this quarter would certainly cause trouble, and I think that steps should be taken to prevent his making any such visit, should it appear later that he seriously contemplates doing so. I therefore submit this report with the request that the Government of India will be pleased to favour me with instructions as to what action should be taken, should such a contingency arise. Translation of a letter No. 149, dated 5th October 1905, from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I beg to forward herewith copy of a letter from Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Eahman, Amir of Nejd, to the Chief of Debai. He has addressed similar letters to the other Chiefs. Herewith is also enclosed copy of a letter from Khalid-bin-Abdulla-es- Soweidi residing at Katr to the Chief of Abu Dhabi, and of the letter from Amer bin Shaban of J3eni Hajir to the Chief of Abu Dhabi. They all contain reports regarding the aforesaid Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Eahman. The Chief of Abu Dhabi has despatched the letter received by him from Abdul Aziz-biu-Abdul Rahman, to His Highness Syed Pysel, Sultan of Maskat, and intends proceeding to Maskat by the mail steamer which is due at Debai from Bussorah on the 6th October 1905.

Our state is good by God's grace. I write to inform you that I came to these parts in consequence of the disagreement which had taken place between the Yam tribe (i.e., Ajman). I visited Katr and effected a reconciliation between them and punished the offenders. I proposed to stay there to look into certain affairs, but it became too hot— the heat of this country is well known—and I will, if God please, visit these parts without fail when the spring comes. My object in doing so is to look into certain affairs. I thought it desirable to inform you of this. Halnad-el-Hareibi will furnish you with further particulars. Translation of a letter dated from Khalid-bin-Abdullah-es-Soweidin to Sheikh Zaeed-bin-Khalifah. I have received your esteemed letter and was glad to hear of your welfare. Sheikh Hamadan's letter has been received and gladdened me. I write to furnish you with the news of Bin Saood and the Bedouins. After his arrival at El Hassa, he remained there for several days and he was given a grand entertainment. He summoned them (the inhabitants) and issued Bills on them. No one could reject the Bills. He has appointed three Sheikhs at El Hassa for hearing complaints and imprisoning people. The Askers (Turkish soldiers) were obedient to his orders. He made peace between / Jy-the Bedouins. And Bin Saood will take action against whomsoever found guilty of haying committed robberies. Mazyad and Nawleh-bin-Sherim of Al Murreh, Bin Shaban of Beni Hajir and Mansoor-bin-Ghanim of Kheyarin came to him and were reconciled with him. He made peace between them and Ajman and other tribes and proceed ed to a watering place named Azarnookeh to-day. Mansoor-bin-Ghanim came to me, gave me this news and brought me a complimentary letter from him informing me of this arrangement. After the peace was made the representative of Mari (Al Murreh) went to Baeej and that of Beni Hajir proceeded to Araij. As regards Ali-bin-Ahmed (El Khalifah of Bahrein), the Christians summoned him to Bushire and told him either to remain as before, that is to say, as a wicked man (Sbaki) or to undergo five years' imprisonment at Maskat. He preferred to undergo imprisonment and proceeded to Maskat. Translation of the purport of a letter (undated) from Amer-bin-Shaban to the Chief of Abu Dhabi.

I was reconciled to him ; and he made peace between me and the Ajmans and others. By God 1 Oh Zaeed! my eyes did not fail to see the trays, tents, house furniture, coffee pots of Constantinople make, belonging to Bin Hashid (which were with Bin Saood). Your turn has come now. He said ' Oh Amer, by God, I will explore the country belonging to my father and grandfather, from Maskat to Jealan.' Oh ! Zaeed, I saw that he turned his eyes (towards you). I asked him whether he had a good intention or a bad one. JSe said he would act upon God's will. I said ' Zaeed is the Imam of the Arab Coast and has relations with your people at Katif and El Hassa, and this fact is not hidden,' He said he would do everything properly. He is a man of high account. As to El Hassa by God, the day'he made his entry there, his men took charge of the local administration; and he deprived that place of all its valuables.

They then came to Shargah and entered into an otfensive and defensive alliance, which, it is believed, is aimed at the Chief of Abu Dhabi. No. 441'1-E. B., dated Fort William, the 5th December 1905. From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 513, dated the 29th October 1905, requesting to be furnished with instructions as to the attitude6 you should adopt, should Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdul Rahman-bin-Saood endeavour to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman. 2. The Government of India, while noting your view as to the improbabi lity of the visit taking place, are of opinion that the matter is sufficiently serious to justify immediate action; and they are inclined to think that the best way of exercising pressure on Bin Saood with a view to preventing the visits, might be through the channel of the Sheikh of Koweit who controls, to a large extent, the supply of arms for Nejd, which must still be a matter of importance to Bin Saood. 3. Ihe Political Agent at Koweit is, therefore, authorized, unless you see any objection, to make enquiries of Sheikh Mubarak as to the facts, A report should in that case be sent of the results of the interview. 4. Since the present rumour appears to be somewhat indefinite, care should bo taken at the present stage not to give too official a character to any commu nication that may be made to Sheikh Mubarak. G.

(Aitchison's Treaties, Vol. X., p. 116). Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 22nd February 1900. With reference to my letter of the 29th April 1904 as to the affairs of Nejd, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to enclose, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a * ^ „ t , , , further Seeret Letter 9 * from the * rso. /, Ibeoref, dated 11th J;inuary 1906, ^ c t i;„ an ,l enclosuiTs. ' Government of India on the sub- ject of a visit which the W ahabi Amir Abdul Aziz bin Saood is reported to be intending to make to the Pirate Coast and Muscat in the coining spring. It will be observed that, on the 5th December 1905, the Government of India authorised enquiries being made of the Sheikh of Koweit as to Bin Saood's intentions, but that the result has not yet been reported. In the meanwhile the Government of India, in view of the serious consequences which would ensue if Bin Saood should succeed in establishing his ascendency over the Trucial Chiefs or the Sultan of Muscat, suggest that he should be approached either through the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat or other suitable channel, with a view to ascertaining whether he is prepared to stand by the Declarationf of his pre lecessor not to oppose or t See Declaration o( the Wahabi Anur, injure British subjects residing in his territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government. In regard to this I am to observe that the declaration made in 1866 was not pnyposed, or even formally accepted, by the British Government, and it contained a reference to the claim of the Wahabis upon the customs of Muscat. The Govern ment of India further suggest that, in the event of Bin Saood's failing to give the necessary assurance, he should be warned that any attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or on the Pirate Coast would be regarded as an unfriendly act, and that suitable measures would be taken to frustrate it. These measures in the opinion of the Government of India might consist either of a more stringent, embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and eleevvhere, or, in the case of necessity, of actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened. The serious consequences which might arise from the re-establish ment by Bin Saood of the Wahabi dynasty throughout the centra of Arabia were referred to in the Despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople of the 10th May 1904, No. 373, and the question is further complicated if, as appeals to be the case, Bin Saood has been recognised by the Turkish Government and has acknowledged the suzerainty of the Sultan. It will be observed that the Government of India consider that it would be useless and undesirable to bring pressure to bear on Bin Saood through the Turkish authorities. So far as Muscat is concerned I am to observe that the French Government is conjointly with the British Government interested in its independence, and, in the event of interference by the Wahabis with the Trucial Chiefs, the measures proposed by the Government of India might not be effective. For instance, such control as we may be able to exercise over the importation of arms into Arabia is limited to arms imported by British subjects. The questions raised by the Government a 2cJ of India are thus complicated, and in view of our desire to refrain from any entanglements with the rulers of Nejd, it seems desirable to take no steps, in the absence of any urgent necessity caused by ahabi action, until His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople has been consulted on the proposal to approach Bin Sacod otherwise than through the Turkish authorities. The suggestion of the Government of India that, in the es^ent of Bin Saood's failing to give satisfactory assurances, a more stringent embargo should be placed upon the traffic in arms, appears to raise a further difficulty by conveying the implication tiiat in the contrary event the Government of India would be prepared to acquiesce in the import of arms bv the Sheikh of Koweit. * See Sir T. Sanderson's letter, dated Mr Morley is aware that in June 2i8t June 1904. 1904* it was decided to defer measures which were then under consideration for preventing the import of arms into Koweit. He would, however, l:e reluctant to approve any permanent departure from the established policy of His Majesty's Government of maintaining an effective control over the arms traffic in these waters.

I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, relative to the proposed visit of the Wahahi Amir to the Pirate Coast and Muscat. I am to inform you that a copy of your letter has been sent to His Majesty 's Ambassador at Constantinople for his observations, and that a further communication will be addressed to you on receipt of his reply.

With reference to the letter from this Office of the 1st instant, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a Despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople regarding the projected visit of the Wahabi Amir to the Pirate Coast and Muscat. It will be observed that Sir N. O'Conor is of opinion that any warning given to the Amir respecting his relations with the Trucial Chiefs and Muscat will be more effective if conveyed to him directly rather than through the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat, and I am to inform you that Sir E. Grey concurs in this view. I am, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State E. Gokst. for India.51 00241 Annex. Sir N. O'Conor to Sir E. Grey. No. 189. Confidential. Constantinople, 8ir, 20th March 1906. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Despatch No. 92, of the 1st instant, in which you were so good as to ask for my observations on a letter from the India Office enclosing correspondence relative to the projected visit of the Wahahi Amir to the Pirate Coast and to Muscat in the spring. While I quite concur in the view of the Secretary of State for India that serious complications would ensue should the Ameer succeed in establishing his ascendancy over the Trucial Chiefs and Muscat, and that it would be well to convey to him a warning that bis action in those parts must be limited by respect for our engagement with the tribes with which we have treaties, I am disposed to think that such warning will be more effective if conveyed directly rather than through the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat. As regards Moubarek, it seems fairly certain that, in view of the more friendly relations which have recently been established between him and the local Turkish Authorities of Basra, the Porte would at once get news of our communication to Abdul Aziz, and would in all probability take steps to neutralize its effect. I would therefore suggest, for the consideration of His Majesty's Government, that our warning would be more effective if it could be arranged that a vessel of war should meet Abdul Aziz at one of the places along the coast which he proposes to visit, and he were given clearly to understand that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Trucial Chiefs will be allowed.

The bulk of the file is correspondence between the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agents in Kuwait and Sharjah, the Foreign Department of the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India in Whitehall, the British Embassy in Constantinople, the various Trucial Sheikhs, Sheikh Mubarak of Kuwait, and Ibn Sa'ud. Included within this are letters sent amongst the Arab rulers themselves that came into the possession of the British via the Agent at Sharjah.The file begins with reports of Ibn Sa'ud's visit to al-Hasa in the summer of 1905 where he reconciled the quarrelling tribes of 'Ajman, al-Murrah, and Bani Hajar, and his talk of visiting the Trucial Coast and Oman. A discussion follows on how the British should deal with the consequential unrest and injury to trade in the Gulf should the visit occur, often seeking the advice of Sheikh Mubarak of Kuwait due to his close connection to Ibn Sa'ud. Warnings are then given to the Trucial Sheikhs to refrain from contact with Ibn Sa'ud and measures of blocking the arms trade to Kuwait and more direct military action are put forward. The file ends (at the close of 1907, after a gap of a year) with reports from Sheikh Mubarak that complaints about the British and requests for contact with Ibn Sa'ud had come to him from several of the Trucial rulers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Mubārak bin Ṣabāḥ Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Murrah (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Ajmān (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Hājir (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Al-Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000211#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
