Included are reports of searches undertaken on vessels suspected of trafficking of arms, including inventories of seized goods, and records of land attacks undertaken on arms depots and caches along the Gulf coastline.The later correspondence discusses the discovery of arms and ammunitions being smuggled into Koweit within cases of loaf sugar (sugarloaf), and attempts to identify those responsible for sending and receiving the smuggled goods.The principal correspondents include the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Arnold Kemball, and Percy Zachariah Cox); the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (William George Grey, and Frank McConaghey); the Political Agent at Kuwait (Stuart George Knox, and William Henry Irvine Shakespear); the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department (Hugh Shakespear Barnes, Sir Louis William Dane, and Spencer Harcourt Butler); the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey) and India (Lord George Francis Hamilton, William St John Fremantle Brodrick, John Morley, Viscount Morley of Blackburn); the Viceroy of India; the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station (Edmond John Warre Slade, and Richard Henry Peirse); the Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department (Malcolm Henry Stanley Grover); the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf (Victor Gallafent Gurner, Charles Pipon Beaty-Pownall, and James C Tancard); and representatives of the Foreign Office, the India Office and the Admiralty.This is part 3 of 10. Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Navy, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Secretary to the Marine Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Koweit</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><subject><topic>Naval operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000005#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000005#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000005#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
