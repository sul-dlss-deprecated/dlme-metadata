The Secretary of State writes that the An 0 lo-Persian Oil Company deaire to get exclusive prospecting rights all down the Arabian littoral of the Gulf and in Oman and ask for the High Commissioner's views and mine. Do you think negotiations could be undertaken at once if necessary ? I presume the Sultan's Government would not raise objections but what do you think that the attitude of the Imam and Oman would be ? They would not consider themselves bound b$i an agreement made by the Sultan's Government I presume? And I fanc^y their attitude towards prospecting and to prospectors etc would probably be hostile. Telegram R. From Political Muscat To Resident Bushire No.1306 dated 10/9/21. The question raised by the Secretary of State frankly most- difficult. First I think any agreement would have to be made with the Sultan as it is a matter of foreign policy and Oman is theoretically part of his dominions. Matter with him would resolve itself into one of mone„ and he would probably agree to allow prospecting subject to royalty in case of oil being found. He would be made to guarantee safety on the coast ufct would not expressly in the interior and leave us to make arrangements with the tribes on our responsibility. Directly this was done it would be necessary to approach the Imam and the tribes. It would be a question of money and though negotiations would be most difficult it might be possible to obtain permission onon condition subsidy would be paid t^^retically for protection and if oil was found further subsidy which would be really type of royalty. This complicated method only means as they would not be bound by agreement made by the Sultan and theywould consider prospecting against normal trade and travel. For these reasons I think emphatically that negotiations could not be undertaken for some time.a /- Ar/- 1 ^.

Before oennenting upon the provisions of this^Agreenent, l desire to explain in sono detail the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards this Concession and towards the question of the grant of Oil Conoesoiono on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian milf In general. For this purpose it will be convenient to review briefly the oircunstanoes which have led up to the present situation, in this despatch I do not propose to deal with the question of the Nejd Concession, since this v/ili form tho subject of a separate despatch. 8. As you are aware, His Majesty's Government as part of a considered policy have obtained from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and from othor native rulers in the Persian Gulf, formal undertakings to the effect that they will not grant any concessions for the development of Oil in their territories to any person, or persons, not approved { ,, appolntod ,, ) by His Majesty's Government. Hie object of THE -JTINO RESIDTOT IN THE PERSIAN GULF., 3 s) OBTAinlng these undertakings was two-fold# In the flrot place it was intended thereby to protect the ml ora theiraoelwea against the pernicious activities of unscrupulous Concession hunters of the type which preyed so successfully upon the Turkish £*xpire before the war, and secondly it was desired by this weans to restrict the grant of Concessions to reputable British fime, and thus to prevent the infiltration of foreign inoluenoo in the Persian oulf, which was regarded as politically undesirable* 3 * In order to avoid advantage being taken of the native rulers* inexperience in such natters. It was laid down that applicants for Concessions ehould not negotiate diroot with the Sheikha, but should, in the first instance seek His majesty’s 0ovemnont , o permission to apply for a Concession upon approved linos, and, having obtained ouch pennisolon and agreed upon temo which His Ma3osty , s Government would be prepared to recommend to the Sheikhs as acceptable, should then open negotiations either through the Political Resident or through the medium of the Political Agent concerned. Jta&lt;the summer of 1921 the Anglo—Persian Oil Company expressed a desire to secure a series of exclusive prospecting licenses for Oil over the whole Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf# The Company*e proposal was referred to this Department by the India Office and, as my predecessor was satisfied that the Anglo—Persian oil Company were in a position to undertake and carry out satisfactorily the dovoiopnont of the oil resources of that area, the proposal was accepted in principle# After considerable correspondence and negotiation the main heads of an Agreement covering exploratory and prospecting rights in the territories of Bahrain and Kuwait were drawn up in agreement with the Company by the interested Department of His Majesty's oovernront. anda A, tZU — V -O ©fi and vore ooonunloatod to the Politioal Realdont for suhnlsslon to the SholKhe ooncomed* Iheae draft heads of , Agreonent, which were Adapted from the usual Colonial Model f were so franed as to provide the nucleus of an Agreenent, which would, in ray opinion, have been In every way favourable to the Interesto of the Sheikha, in that they were designed not only to provide for the expeditious and systematic A development of the oil resources of their territories, but also to produce for the Sheikha very handsome royalties# 5# However, before any agreement could be concluded Major Heines, avowedly, and probably actually, in ignorance of the neoesslty for obtaining the prior permission of His Majesty 1 a Government, approached the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain direct and succeeded in inducing then to grant or .s undertake to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate, exploitation of oil and other minerala in their territories# features (notably the provision whereby the Sheikhs would receive a percentage of the shares of the exploitation Company, in the place of a definite royalty based upon output) and they would in any case romiire to be substantially modified before I should feel Justified in advising the Sheikhs to accept then# But suite apart from this t i consideration, I felt very strongly that the Sheikhs should impunity, nor that 'unapproved' firms, by approaching than direct, should be permitted to secure Concessions the terms of whioh had not previously boon submitted to Hie Majesty’s Govemnentf particularly in view of the fact that the whioh he represented, exclusive Concessions for the 6 • These concossions contain several imsatisfactory Anglo-A A ^ ■ O % Anglo-Poralan oil Conpany would thereby have directly suffered aa a result of having carefully observed all the conditions required by Hio Hajesty f s oovemnent# A tel egrets was therefore sent to Colonel Trevor on the 50th June instructing him to inform the Shel&amp;hs that His Majesty 1 s Govonnent would not approve of the oonoesolons which contrary to their undertakings they had granted to Major Holmes, and that the Pastern and General Syndicate was not a firm approved by His Majesty’s Government# 7# By this latter statement it must not bo understood that my intention ms to give the impression that His Majesty’s Government had spy objection in principle to the Eastern and General Syndicate except on the grounds of the irregular manner in Which their Concessions had been obtained* On the contrary, so far as His Majesty’s Gowemmont are aware the Eastern and General syndicate although possessing neither the wide experience of oil production nor the efficient organisation and financial strength of the Anglo-Peroian ell Company are a substantial and reputable fins* 8* In view of the attitude taken up by Pis Majesty’s Government the Sadtern and General syndicate have nw volunteered to modify their Concessions in such manner as to Conform to the wishes of Ills Majesty’s Government* Those concessions have not yet boon closely examined in the Colonial office but if in fact the syndicate show themselves willing to accept such suggested modifications as may upon examination prove to bb necessary, and moreover iViaJ* *%o-kO / S '-*■ 2 * are able to satiafy no that they are in a position and intend to carry out to the full the obligations which they propose to undertake towards the Sheikhs* I shall no longer* subject to ny remarks In the following paragraph, feel any strong objection to their candidature# 0* on the other hand* the Angl ©-Persian oil V Company both by their priority of application and by their due obeerwanoo of the correct procedure, have in ny op&amp;l&amp;cn established an undoubted claim to His HaJosty f s Governments prior support, provided, of course, that they are prepared to offer to the Sheikhs terns at least as favourable as those submitted by the Eastern and General syndicate# Conoerruently I am not prepared to recognise the Concessions granted to the latter Company unless and until the Sheikh of Kuwait has set forth his objections to the draft Agreement submitted to him by Sir Arnold Wilson! has explained hie statement (reported in the telegram of the 13th July from the Political Agent, Kuwait, a copy of which accompanied your despatch of the 30th July Ho# 378) that the draft Agreement is entirely unacceptable to himself and his people: has satisfied mo of the validity of thooo objections!

Trevor, C.S.L, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 218-S. of 1921, DATED BuSHIRE, THE 8TH (RECEIVED 20TH) SEPTEMBER 1921. Subject: — Anglo-Persian Oil Company's desire to obtain concessions to 'prospect for oil on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence between the Colonial Office and the India Office regarding the desire of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain concessions for oil in certain Arabian territories on the Persian Gulf Littoral, copies of which were sent to the Foreign and Poli tical Department and to me (with Mr. Wak^ly’s letter No. P.-2794, dated 30th June 1921)T 2. I waited to reply to this as I expected some communication from, the Government of India, but as considerable time has elapsed, and His Excellency the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia has already communi cated his views in his letter No. S D -1928, dated the 10th August (a copy of which is annexed in case it has not alreadv been sent to the Government of India), I think it advisable to submit my views without further delay- 3. As regards Kuwait and Bahrain I agree with His Excellency the High Commissioner that, in view of the Conventions of 27th October 1913, and 14th May 1914, which we have made with the respective Sheikhs, there is no objection to negotiations being opened at once. I also concur with His Excellency that the Style “ Anglo-Persian Oil Company ”■ is undesirable -for a Company obtaining a concession in Bahrain and that it would be advisable to form a subsidiary company to be styled “The Arab Coast Oil Company ”, or “ The Arabian Oil Company ”. I presume the same Company would prospect all down the Arabian Littdral and Oman, so perhaps it might be styled “ The Eastern Arabian Oil Company ”, unless operating all over Arabia in which case “ The Arabian Oil Company ”, or “ The Anglo-Arabian Oil Company ” would be better. 4. As regards Muscat, the present Council of Ministers is very amenable, and I think that if they were sounded by the Political Agent on the subject we should find that no objection would be likely and that negotiations might be opened at once with the Muscat Government. But as the Government of India are aware, the writ of the Muscat Government does not carry far beyond the coast, and what view the Imam and the Omanis would take is difficult to say. I am enquiring from the Political Agent who has just returned to Headquarters if he can give any idea on this point 5 .In respect to the Trucial Coast, I would observe that the Sheikhs and Tribes of this part of the world are extraordinarily ignorant and back ward and I think that a sudden request for exclusive prospecting rights would be regarded with the greatest suspicion and would meet with deter mined opposition in all the Sheikhdoms. I think it would be best in the case of these Sheikhs to endeavour, in the first instance to obtain Conventions similar to those made with Kuwait and Bahrain, and later on to try for concession if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, after prospecting in the neighbouring countries, thought it worth While to prospect on the Trucial Coast. M ith the exception of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi the Trucial Coast Sheikhs have only a narrow strip of sandy soil between the Oman Hills and the sea; whether this is likely to contain oil or not of course I cannot say, but I should think prospecting there might well be left to the last. 6 I agree with His Excellency the High Commissioner that it would be good policv for the Company to pay a lump sum to clinch the negotia- Hous if the Arab Potentates concerned show they would welcome it and especially if they agree to exempt the machinery of the Company from Customs dues. , T j- A copy of this letter is being sent direct to the India Office.

Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 223-S. of 1921, DATED BuSHIRE, THE 13TH (RECEIVED 28TH) SEPTEMBER 1921. Subject: — Anglo-Persian Oil Company's desire to obtain concessions to prospect for oil on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. In continuation of paragraph 4 of my letter No. 218-S., dated 8th September 1921, I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of telegrams ,which have been exchanged between the Political Agent, Muscat and myself regarding the request of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to exclusive prospecting rights in Oman., 2. I think the view of the Political Agent is correct and that it would not be advisable to open negotiations immediately. I think we shall have to wait until it has been possible to get into closer touch with the Imam and the Omanis, and if possible to souud them on the subject. It will certainly be necessary, as stated by Mr. Wingate, that a subsidiary agreement should be made with them as they would not consider themselves bound by an agreement made by the Sultan’s Government. A copy of this letter has been sent direct to the India Office and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, Baghdad. Enclo. I to Serial No. 4. —Telegram R., from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to Political Agent, Muscat, No. 1531, DATED THE 9th SEPTEMBER 1921. Secretary of State writes that Anglo-Persian Oil Company desire to get exclusive prospecting rights all down Arabian Littoral of Gulf and in Oman and asks High Commissioner’s and my views. Do you think nego tiations could be undertaken at once if necessary? Presume Sultan’s Government would not raise objections, but what do you think attitude of Imam and Omanis would be? They would not consider themselves bound by agreement made by Sultan’s Government, I presume? And I fancy their attitude towards prospecting and prospectors, etc., would probably be hostile. Enclo. II to Serial No. 4 .— Telegram R., from Political Agent, Muscat, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No, 1306, DATED THE 10th (RECEIVED llTH) SEPTEMBER 1921. Your telegram 1531. Question raised by Secretary of State frankly most difficult. Firstly I think any agreement would have to be made with Sultan as it is matter of Foreign policy and Oman is theoretically part of his dominion. Matter with him would resolve itself into (1) money and he would probably agree to allow prospecting subject to royalty in case of oil being found. He would be made to guarantee safety on coast but would not be expressly (responsible for?) interior and leave us to make arrange ments with tribesmen on our responsibility. Directly this was done it would be necessary to approach Imam and tribesmen. It would be question of money and though negotiations w'ould be most difficult it might be possible to obtain permission on condition that subsidy would be paid them theoretically for protection and if oil was found further subsidy which would really typify royalty. This complicated method only means as they would not be bound by agreement made by Sultan and they would consider prospecting against' normal trade and travel. For these reasons I think emphatically negotiations could not be under taken for some time. LXI-39oSerial No. 13. — Letter from the Hon'rle Lieutenant-Colonel A. P. Trevor. C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 38-S., dated Bushire, the 10th (received 23rd) January 1922. Desire of Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain exclusive prospecting rights on Arabian littoral of Persian Gulf. With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram, No. 2374-S., dated 11th October 1921 on the subject of the desire of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain exclusive rights to prospect for oil on the Arabian littoral, I have the honour to forward herewith for the inform ation of the Government of India a copy of the following correspondence on the subject:— (1) Letter dated 22nd December 1921, from Resident Director, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to Political Resident, asking to be allowed to open negotiations with Bahrain and enclosing (2) Letter dated 22nd December 1921, from Resident Director, to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, asking to be allowed to open negotiations with the Sheikh of Kuwait and enclosing draft agreement: (3) Telegram No. 22, dated 3rd January 1922, from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf to High Commissioner, Baghdad, repeated to Political Agent, Kuwait. (4) Telegram No. 4-S., datel 4th January 1922, from Political Agent, Kuwait to High Commissioner, repeated Political Resident, Persian Gulf. (5) Letter No. 36-S., dated 10th January 1922, from Political Resi dent, Persian Gulf, to Resident Director, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Mohammerah. 2. I do not think that the procedure suggested by Sir Arnold Wilson— riz., that he and I should proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement and try and get the Sheikh to sign it—is likely to be successful, because the Sheikh is very old and obstinate and will require a lot of talking to before he will agree to sign any such agreement. This, as I have stated in enclo sure No. 3, can only be done by the Political Agent in the absence of any representative of the Company resident in the place. When the Political Agent thinks that the Sheikh has adopted a reasonable attitude and shows signs of being willing to sign, a representative of the Company might go over with a draft agreement for final discussion and signature. 3. From enclosure No. 4 it will be seen that the Political Agent, Kuwait feels certain that Sheikh Ahmad would not sign such an agreement straight off; so I think that it will be best for the Political Agents in both places to do the preliminary negotiations. 4. If the procedure indicated above is adopted, there will be no need to follow that suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir Arnold Wilson’s letter, which I venture to think is hardly suitable. As the same agreement is required from the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain and I shall have to deal with the Bahrain one, the most convenient plan would seem to be for me to arrange both, but for me to appear at Kuwait on behalf of the High Commissioner and then proceed to Bahrain as the representative of Government seems anomalous. A copy of this letter is being sent direct to the India Office. Enclosure I to Serial No. 13 .— Letter from Sir A. T. Wilson Resident A Director, Strick Scott, &amp; Co., Ltd., to the Honourable the Politi cal Resident, Bushire, dated the 22nd December 1921 I have' the honour to enclose for your information a copy of a letter which I have addressed this day to His Excellencv the High Commissioner Baghdad2 2. I beg to apply for permission to negotiate on the same lines with the Sheikh of Bahrain, and to solicit your personal assistance in the matter in. due course: I venture to hope that if and when permission to negotiate is granted you will find it possible to be present in person at the negotiations. 3. I further solicit your assistance in obtaining from the Trucial Chiefs conventions in regard to the Exploitation of Oil similar to those already made with Kuwait (27th October 1913) and Bahrain (14th May 1914). Enclosure II to Serial No. 13. —Letter from Sir A. T. Wilson, Resident Director, Strick Scott &amp; Co.- Ltd., to His Excellency the High Commissioner, Baghdad, dated the 22nd December 1921. I have the honour to state that I have been instructed by the Board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited to open negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait with a view to concluding agreements with them in connection with Oil in their territories. 2. As you are no doubt aware, it was provided under the arrangements concluded in 1914 for a fusion of interests in regard to Turkey of the D’Arcy Exploration Company and of the Turkish Petroleum Company that none of the participants would interest themselves in concessions any where in the Ottoman Empire otherwise than through the Turkish Petro leum Company. 3. The Clause in question reads as follows: — “ 10. The three groups participating in the Turkish Petroleum Com pany shall give undertakings on their own behalf and on be half of the Companies associated with them not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production or manu facture of Crude Oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe or Asia, except in that part which is under the administration of the Egyptian Government or of the Sheikh of Kuwait or in the “ Transferred territories ” on the Turko-Persian Erontier, otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company 4. You will note that the territories of the Sheikh of Kuwait are specifically excluded. 5. The Board do not consider it necessary at this stage to incur the considerable expense involved in registering a new subsidiary Company, and propose that negotiations should be conducted on behalf of the D’Arcy Exploration Company. I trust that this course wid have your concurrence. 6. I enclose a draft of the Concession which T propose to negotiate with the Shaikh of Kuwait, if and when I have your authority to do so, for which authority I now beg to apply. 7. As regards Article 10 of the draft, in view of the fact that the Bakhtiari Khans are taking such strong exception to the deduction of In come Tax on dividends to which they are entitled, the Company would prefer to a share interest an arrangement under which an annual payment equivalent to 10 per cent, of the nett profits, after providing for deprecia tion, etc., should be paid to the Shaikh. In this connection reference is invited to the terms on which the A P. O. C. holds its concession from the Persian Government: viz., 16 per cent, of nett profits. It is considered by the Board that not more than 10 per cent, would be justified in the case of Kuwait and Bahrain in view of the somewhat unpromising prospects of finding oil at either place, and the very heavy capital expenditure involved, and of the purely nominal assistance in regard to protection required from the Chiefs at either place—practically no pipe line would be needed for .' example if oil were found. 8. I have no official information as to whether Kuwait is at present for purposes of Political Administration under Baghdad or Bushire, and only venture to address you on the subject as the result of an informal conver sation with the Political Agent-V-O / x ft A //&gt; 3 As however I have also to negotiate v/ith Bahrain, and as I would propose to do so (subject to the approval of the Political Resident) immedi- atelv after the completion of negotiations with Kuwait, I venture to ask that&amp;Lieutenant-Colonel Trevor may be authorised bv you to accompany me to Kuwait in R. I. M. S. “ Lawienee ” to assist me on your behalf in these negotiation^: without your or his presence the Shaikh might, on view of his arrangements on the subject with Government, not f^el justified in negotiating. 9. I have sent a copy of this letter with enclosures to the Honourable the Political Resident 1 m the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Kuwait. COPY. Draft Agreement.

He has also addressed me asking to be allowed to take similar action in Bahrein. I have not yet received any instructions from Government that negotia tions should be opened but in any case I think it would best for preliminaries to be undertaken by the respective Political Agents. I do not know present Sheikh of Kuwait but I doubt if he would be prepared to sign an agreement of the sort straight off when presented to him by Sir A. Wilson and mvself, and I am quite sure the Sheikh of Bahrein would not. Latter would certain ly require a lot of talking to first and probably former would too. This I think Should be left to Political Agents with support from me if-necessary, and when Sheikh is amenable representative of Anglo-Persiari Oil Company might take over agreement to be discussed and signed.

So far His Majesty’s Government have not given permission for nego tiations t6 be opened, no doubt however they will do so shortly. When they do however I think the best plan will be for the Political Agents to prepare the way by preliminary talk’s with the respective Sheikhs. I am quite certain that the Sheikh of Bahrain who is as you know very old and rather obstinate, will never agree to sign an agreement of this sort straight off. He will need a lot of talking to and persuasion which can onl} be done by the Political Agent as there is no representative of the Company resident at Bahrain. I do not know the present Sheikh of Kuwait but the Political Agent states that he is quite sure that Sheikh Ahmad would not be willing to sign the agreement without lengthy discussions and consultations. In the circumstances I think the best course would be to instruct the Political Agent at Bahrain to discuss the question with tlje Sheikh when ever possible and report when the Sheikh shows signs of becoming amenable; a representative of the Company could then proceed to Bahrain with the draft agreement for final discussion and signature If necessary I would support the Political Agent in the preliminary negotiations I think similar procedure would probably be best in Kuwait also, L XI- Sf'GSerial No. 20. —Confidential letter from the Hon’ble Lieutenant- Colonel A.

These were handed to me personally on May 2nd, May 3rd and May 4th^. respectively when I visited these ports during my recent tour in R. I M. S. “ Lawrence ”. It will be seen that the wording of the letter of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is slightly different; this was due to the fact that he considers him self the principal Sheikh on the Trucial Coast and as such did not like to copy the words used by the others. I think however the words he has used will serve the purpose. The Sheikh of Umm-el-Qawain was unfortunately absent from his headquarters, but I hope to secure a similar undertaking from him on my next visit if the Residency Agent cannot get one before; I fancy he will be able to as the Sheikh of. Umm-el-Qawain is in a contrite frame of mind at present. Enclosure 1 to Serial No. 27. —Letter from Sheikh Saeed ben Maktoom. Chief of Debai. to Lieutenant-Colonel A. P.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign and Poli tical Department, endorsement No. 497/107-Ext., regarding the desire o^ the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to obtain exclusive prospecting rights on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, I have the honour to forward’herewith fcfr the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. 25-C., dated 19th May 1922, from the Political Agent Muscat, stating that the Sultan has informed him of a reported show of oil in the Southern part of the Gulf of Masirah, and further that His Highness has had the report verified as far as it can be done by an uneducated and in expert Arab. 2. From what Major Rae says it seems almost certain that a seepage exists at the place mentioned. I do not know if the Geological Survey oi India would have sufficient data regarding the region to enable them to give any opinion as to the chances of obtaining oil in paying quantities. I he neighbourhood of Masirah is a wild and savage country, and on more than one occasion, as the Government of India are aware, the crews of wrecked steamers have been maltreated in that region. There is no doubt however that the inhabitants consider themselves within the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, and that they have nothing to do with the more or less autonomous Omanis inhabiting the country to the West and North-West of Muscat. The report of the Sultan’s emissary that the natives do not mention the show of oil as they do not want interference is quite probable, and I fancy they would do their best to discourage prospectors and exploiters, who would have to be in a position to protect themselves. 3. However since there seems little doubt that a show of oil exists, it seems advisable to take steps that the future exploitation of it (if necessary) should be done by British interests. On the other hand it seems unlikely that the negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company regarding a prospecting license for Oman will be settled for some time. I venture there fore to suggest that the Political Agent should be authorized to negotiate with the Sultan an agreement regarding oil in his territories similar to the conventions made bv the Sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain, or on the lines of the Sur Coal Agreement of 31st May 1902 (No. LXIX, page 242, Aitchison Vol. XII). Ah agreement on either of these lines w^quld protect British interests, and, as there is now so much competition for oil all over the world, the sooner, in my opinion, an agreement is made, the better. I would there fore, suggest that, as the Sultan will not return to Muscat until December next, the Political Agent may be authorized to negotiate one with His High ness the Sultan, if possible, while on recess in India. Enclo. to Serial No. 57.—Confidential letter from Major M. E. Rae, I.A , Political Agent and H. B. M.’s Consul, Muscat, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 25-C., dated Muscat, the 19th May 1922. Oil in Muscat Territory. I have the honour to say that information has been received which seems reliable that there is an oil show near the coast in the southern part of the Gulf of Masirah. The information was given me by H. H. the Sultan who had sent a man specially to verify the information as f^r as an uneducated and inexpert Arab could do. The messenger has reported that oil does showat the place where it had been reported to show, but that the people of the neighbourhood wish to keep this secret as they do not want to be interfered with. It would be interesting to know if the Geological Survey of India can say whether there is any probability of a workable supply of oil being found m this neighbourhood. ' - Hie report of this oil show raises the question of Governmenit’s wdshes about oil exploitation in Muscat territory. Your telegram* No. 1531, dated Jth September 1921, showed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company wished to obtain exclusive prospecting rights, but did not show if Government approv ed ot their doing so. I have, therefore, the honour to request that I may be informed if Government desire that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should or should not acquire all oil interests in Muscat territory. If it is Government’s desire that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should acquire all oil interests in Muscat territory I wxmld ask permission to a ( 1 the Company direct about the examination of the show now report- ed and also about prospecting in Gwadur territory and on the Oman Coast which it might be possible to arrange. i Mr . Wingate’s reply to your telegram No. 1531, mentioned above dealt only w ith the possibdity of getting exclusive prospecting rights for the Anglo- 1 ersian Oil Company in Oman proper. I think it would be simpler and more effective to obtain an agreement similar to that regarding the Sur Coal fields (Aitchison Vol. XII page 242), covering all mineral oil throughout the oultan s dominions. This would block all concessions not approved by the Government of India. Moreover it would be much easier to arrange for a particular prospecting expedition than for prospecting in general ''and in practice it would be necessary to arrange for each expedition separately whe ther there was a general agreement on the subject or not. If any agriment is required it would have to be negotiated with the Sultan personllly and he will not be in Muscat again until December. I could, of course' visit him in India, if required. % L XI-39Ji J I 4 Serial No. 51. —Confidential letter from the Hon’ble Lieutenant- Colonel A. P. Trevor, C.S.I., C.I.E.. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No 88-S , dated Bushirf, the 23rd February (received 5th March) 1923. Oil in Muscat territory. I have the honour to invite a reference to youi telegram No. 1457-S . dated the 11th December and to the penultimate paragraph of the letter from the Political Secretary, India Office, No P.-4498, dated 9th November 1922, regarding oil concessions on the Arabian sid* 1 of the Gulf and particu larly in Oman. 2. In this connection, I beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter No. 1-C., dated 13th February 1923, from the Political Agent at Muscat forwarding an undertaking given by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, that he will not exploit petroleum in Muscat territory without consulting the Political Agent and without the approval of the Government of India. „ 3. Some delay occurred in obtaining the undertaking, the reason for which Major Rae has explained. This was not due to anv unwillingness on the part of the Sultan to give an undertaking, but merely to his having writ ten rather ambiguously worded undertakings. I recently visited Muscat and His Highness spoke to me on the subject of oil concessions; I gathered that he would be quite ready to give exploration licences, etc., if asked to do so. 4. It will be seen, however, from the Sultan’s undertaking and the concluding portion of Major Rae’s letter that the existence of oil in Masira Bay is not definitely certain, and that the report that its presence had been verified by a special messenger sent by the Sultan (vide enclosure to my letter No. 402-S., dated 2nd June 1922) was based on a misapprehension. ' 'Enclosure to Serial No. 51. —Letter from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire No 1-C., dated the 13th February 1923. Oil in Muscat territory. I have the honour to submit a copy of a letter about oil which I addressed to His Highness the Sultan in pursuance of the instructions contained in your Secretary’s telegram, No. 2009, dated 13th December 1922. I have also the honour to submit in original His Highness’s reply. The agreement in its present form was received on the 5th of this month. The date it bears is that of anothef agreement for which it has been substituted. The delay in obtaining the agreement in its present form has been due to difficulty in reconciling His Highness’s views on fitness of expression with my views on intelligibility. ^ ‘ I find I was wrong in saying in my letter § No. 24-C., of 19th May 1922, that the existence of oil near the shores of the Gulf of Masirah had been verified by a messenger sent by His Highness the Sultan. I misunderstood what His Highness said about this. He said a messenger had been sent and then proceeded to give some details given him by the original reporter which I understood to have been obtained by the messenger. It now seems he merelv gave orders for a messenger to be sent which orders seem to have been for gotten as most business matters are in this country. A special mission is now being organised to see if the oil exists.2 Sub-enclosure to Enclosure to Serial No. 51 »— Letter from the Political Agent and His Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, to His Highness Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, C.S.I., Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat, No 1751, dated the 16th December 1922.

What we heard about the existence of the mineral oil in our territory at Masirah is not still certain. We are beginning to enquire into the existence of this mine and after we know about it there will be a discussion between Your Honour and us regarding its exploitation, taking measures, arrangement of works and necessary conditions.

So far as I am aware the oii. seepages which have been from time to reported are sll in the Maslreh area - a region most difficult of access inhabited by a fanatical and suspicious people nominally under Hie Highnese'e suzerainty 'but actually practically independent who up till now hare always rssented any attempt hy outsiders to enter txm their country, Shaikh Mansur claims control over thaw but it is auestlo&amp;ble how far he oan make good this Olala; any way iVis certain that there is nobody else through whom it would be possible to deal* 6 a The oil seepages hare bsen reported at various times as being near the coast behind Bat H Maldcaz, and Inland from the ooast opposite the Island of Hamar al Hafar but in the last talk I had on the ^ subject with His Highness he said that he believed the main show to be South West of the &gt;»adi Kalbuh liftisr! . Is.

In any case negotiations with the local Shaikh^ \ are bound to be very protracted and much time must elapse between the grant of licenses and actual ex ploration and prospecting* q # This brings me to my last point.The con- -ditlon of the Muscat Btate finances demands that all possible sources of revenue be eacplorsd at an early date and if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are not pre pared definitely to make an effort to develop such mineral resources as Muscat is believed to possesc^* then we oan hardly in justice to Muscat pursue our policy of what amounts practically to reservation of within this field for them and His Highness will be JaUitngI.R.iio. 120 £3/10/24.

A. a i^V 2 4Liy dear Colonel, Confidential. 31st March 1925 Muscat I have cabled to you yet another difference found in the proposed Agreement regarding the oil concession.Thie now omits the second douceur of Rs.10,000 when the prospecting license is granted.Mackie says this has been omitted from the revised form of agreement put before the Shaikh of Koweit. Le tells me to-day he has heard from Jacks that the Colonial Cl j. ice is cabling to you approving of the changes reported by me. I wonder if this will turn out correct. as he has precious little to offer in return. he gets Rs.10,000 down on signing the agreement,and all he can otfer in the way of territory for prospecting and exploration is a very limited extent and subject to the possible compliance of Shaikh Mansur and other Jaalan leaders and tribesmen; and lastly the country round Dhofar - where he says there is oil. I shall counsel Thomas to recommend the signing of the agreement h.h.is certainly not in a position to stick out for big terms as he f has practically nothing to offer. ihomas* ship is a day late and does not come in till the secor .4 April. II.H’s horn seems to be unduly exalted with this fuss about the oil concession and he scarcely seems to appreciate what little he -hs i has to give,and perhaps the A.P.O.C.on their part scarcely have to the effect ' it being understood that certain parts are at present unsafe to enter”. As regards the merits and demerits of this agreement,! think myself that H.H.the Sultan is lucky to have such good terms offered him h as soon as I get your instructions regarding my telegrams. grasped the situation.That is why T have impressed on h.n. to qualify 'the territories under his control' by adding some formula $W r M -* 11 \'2 2 ) ’ 'ft He is certainly not in a position to give a concession over Oman, and failing which, if there is no saving clause,the A.P.O.C* might &gt;J easily claim that he has not carried out hie part of the agree- , an -ment i.e.to give/effective concession over what is known as Oman. J 1 H.H.may stick out for customs on private goods after 10 years; m fijiii p 11 i wmm MHm and I think he would be justified in that up to the extent of not letting the agreement fall to the ground. On Thomas’s arrival * I will let him and Mackie have a real good bargaining, and when they have come nigh to agreement,have the matter clinched. H.n. ha.s been particularly nice throughout and has taken much intelli- -gent interest in the matter. One only wishes he was not to all intents and purposes leaving his State for eight months. He is very pleased you have allowed him H.M.S.'Triad* on the 8th April and is busy packing,so I hear. •i Jii m Ycurs sincerely, (sd) C. G. Crosthwaite P a Sy Mackie and I have been wondering whethr Kamar Bay , where H. H. says there is oil and which I mentioned to you in my last d. o. letter’ lies - i. e. whether in Bushire political jurisdiction or in Aden jurisdiction . It is clear now from Lorimer’s Gazetteer Vol» 1 Historical pp 592 593 that this matter was decided by the Govt of India in 1879. The boundary between the two Residencies is Has Sajar which is eas t of Kamar Bay, and the latter place ( the bay ) is therefore not in Dho.ar. Vol 2 of the same compilation p. 446 gives Kharifot as the westernmost in the Dho£ar district ( see remark column ). Also the Hand Book of Arabia , Admiralty War Staff, 1916 Vol 1 p. 279 says ' Dhofar is employed for the whole coast tract from Has bus westward to a point beyond the village of Kharifot ', which on p. 281 Of the same book is described as the westernmost settlement °f Dhofar. *%*» l* t&amp;z. c 1 / fn IPROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR AN OIL CONCESSION BETWEEN THE A.

Dhofar offers perhaps a field safe for exploration but alleged oil appears to lie west of Sultan’s territory* It is also just possible rival oil concessionaires might approach leading hinterland Shaikhs direct. I therefore suggest that as Colonial Office clearly objects to the monopolist aspect of present proposals and insists on 100000 acres as limit of concessionary area the Company be allowed to divide this area into as many plots as they may desire* Configuration of terrain militates against large blocks.Batina coast is narrow strip between hills and sea* From Muscat southwards is mountainous country right back to the desert. Dhofar province with sea coast length of 130 miles by 18 miles in depth is hilly except for the maritime plain which is 40 miles long and only 10 miles depth at broadest place.Sultan leaves Muscat on 8th and authorises Council of Ministers to conclude agreement if A.P.O.C.continue negotiations.

I will wire the precise date as soon as possible. le should like him to proceed from J-askat borthw&amp;rds to Sohar, and as much beyond that place as possible making excursions Westwards wherever conditions admit to the coastal range. fe hope to send a ^ohamedan surveyor of the Survey of India with him who will also make a rough reconnaissance along the route taken on 1/4 inch scale : he will if need be be left behind after Lees has gone on elsewhere, to complete ai COPY. - 2 - 11. 9. 1925. a 1/1; inch survey of such areas as ere accessible. I believe Alban knows this district, at all events as far as Sohar : if he could be retained at Ifcskat until Lees arrival and could accompany hi® on his northern trip as far as and including Masand&amp;m we would gladly meet the cost of his salary for the period involved - about two months and all his travelling expenses would of course be paid. Gould you see your way to suggest this to the Government of India ? T hen Lees has ^ol as far North as he can he should either charter a dhow and go up the coast to Falcolm and F.lphinstone Inlets, or should return to Soh&amp;r or Maskat and charter a ahow thence. If any of H. M f s ships are available and could without inconvenience ferry him to Malcolm or Elphinstone Inlets we should of course be very grateful. If condition admit we should like him to cross the Msanoam Massif from Dibah Fujairah Shinas or Sohar - but this need not be arranged for at the moment : we should, however, be §uch obliged if you could collect any information re current political conditions for our guidance when the time comes. May we also ask you to be so good as to arrange forCOPY. 11. 9- 1925 - &gt; - for hired transport for the party from laskat Northwards; mules for riding and camels or donkeys for kit. I will wire precise composition of the party and amount of transport required later. I presume that H.H. The Sultan will provide all necessary guards on payment by us under Article 7, 2nd schedule of the Agreement. As regards Dhofar. 1 understand from you that 'Triad would be leaving Bombay for Dhofar about January 11th arid that you would ask the 8.N.O. to be so good as to permit Lees to go in her to Dhofar with his party - via: Indian surveyor, interpreter, and probably 2 or p servants. 1b would probably leave the surveyor at Dhofar to make a 1A irich reconnaissance of such parts of the hinterland are accessible and return to Maskat in the 'Triad* after a cursory examination of the locality.

I have discussed his journey up the Matina coast with Thomas and all arrangements for escorts etc are being made.Isa bin Saleh wont let Lees go into the hinterland at all, replying to Albany letter that the people were ignorant and that owing to the newspapers their minds were against us - though he himself was always the friend of the British. Jilccles will accompany Lees and 1 trust Lees will not attempt to do anything foolish as by trying to go where it is uhsafe. I expect Lees to bring a letter from you to me about the Baraimi project. I feel certain you have refused to allow it and it would be most difficult from our side. Thomas who has just returned from a trip up the coast says that the two so called Muscat tribes of Dedouins lying between Sohar and haraimi are most awkward customers. I have asked Thomas to open any letter Lees may bring from you and to act on it.Muecat 25-10-25. tily dear Lees I am very sorry tnat I shall miss seeing you at Huscat as I must leave to-day for Delhi.I have asked Thomas to make all the ’’political” arrangements for your tour,and as My predecessor,Captain Alban,tried to get permission for you to go a little way into the hinterland,where a Shaikh called Isa bin Caleb, is paramount,but the latter wrote that he was sorry that owing to the ignorance of the people and the nev/s spread about by the newspapers (sic)this v/as not possible. Please therefore confine yourself strictly to the places which Thomas will inform you are safe. I have not heard from the Fol. Resident whether he has passed any orders regarding the j^raimi proposition,but from this side it will be very difficult,if not impossible,to arrange. territory begins that is not Muscat’s - calba and -b'ajaira. I have talked the matter over with Capt.Leir. The ”Triad” will be ready to leave Bombay about the 26th January. at present arranged Captain Lccles will accompany your party.

You say that the Political Resident in they the Persian Gulf wishes that^jaay find here everything necessary for their comfort during their journey in these mountains. There is no doubt that the Wali of this place will do the needful as soon as he hears of the time when they will j&amp;sr reach here. You further say that a steamer of the Oil Company will come here to take them back as soon as they finish with their work. This has become known to me. It is necessary for the geologists to bring with them a good Interpreter to help them ,if they do not know Arabic. You have mentioned that the Political Resident desires that hx the steamer that takes me to Muscat, should land a geologist in the island of Musirah at the place where oil is said to exist. Has the place been ascertained exactly ? Is it in the island or in the mainland,near to it? I have no news from a reliable source as ±h to the exact place. You may know that at my discussion with (your predecessor) H.U.M.’s Consul,Muscat, I had explained verbally that before sending up the geologists to that part,we must aeqaint ourselves with the views of the 'bedouina and their Chiefs who reside at Mi Musirah and-* 1 - A^rtJ t' JcrtcUc. J*) r -o |o the country about it f and should come to terms with the Shaikh of Mu si rah — Shaikh ‘Mansur bin ITasir, who is obeyed on that coast which is inhabited by A1 JANAJAH mostly. His concurrence is necessary and without it no useful result may be expected. You wrxfcfi have written that you met Shaikh Bani Suali and discussed with him on the subject and he replied to you that he must asceratain what Mansur bin Nasir al Majaali has got in his mind as he is the Shaikh of M u sirah. The said Shaikh of Sani Suali has replied rightly because the Shaikhs of lani Juali have not got so much influence there as Shaikh Mansur, Qfcourse we hope help from the said Shaikhs as you think. They also hope that Mansur may not benefit alone. It is not hidden from you that the jcsrijaxits bedouins are always very troublesome in such matters. In these days one of the Shaikhs of £ 3ani Suali— •VP Hamdan bin Hasir who is brother Shaikh Muhammad bin Hasir has visited us and we have delayed him here to take him in the steamer with us. Perhaps through him we may know tha about the place and the pi people. Let it be known to you. ^who As regards this province of Dhofar, it is mysel?\*tai Mihe lat ter wroteftp; suggested to H.J.M.»s Consul.Muscat and [the Political Resident \ to deapatch the geologists to examine in the Persian Gulf this place during the time when we ourselves were here. You have in your letter dated the 18th October 1925 29th Rabi al A wwal 1344 informed me that the gelogists hax&amp; are coming to Muscat and will proceed on the latina Coast upto Khasab to examine that part and that you have addressed Shaikh Isa bin Salih al Harithi to let^-a^ access inside his boundaries. Uodoubt you got frQETia 1 reply according to your wishes. We confidently hope that the Council of Ministers have done every thing possible in the matter and also that the Walls af and the Shaikhs of Satinah have done the needful. We are pleased that you will accompany the geologists, although we did not think it necessary that CanaKii Consul—— 3. should go personally. We are awaiting the arrival of the geologists to arrive here in the month of January to examine the treasures of the land. As you have conveyed to us the compliments of Mr Thomas and Captain Eccles, kindly give them m our Salams. May you ever enjoy happiness, and salams.
