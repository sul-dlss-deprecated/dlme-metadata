(280/12/34). British i-jnbassy, Baghdad. 8th October, 1934. My dear George, I awaited Ward's return in order to discuss with him the subjects of your letter E 3716/58/34 of July 26th. He fully realises the threat to his pilots and will immediately inform us of any impending act of aggression against either the pilots or Iraqi Port rights at Abadan. 2. He tells me that he has for years been trying in vain to secure and tr^in suitable Iraqi pilots, but says that even the river men are not sufficiently sea.minded to pilot big shis; they will not stand the hardships of life in a pilot boat at the mouth of the Shatt and refuse to be parted for long from their families- 3o many of the Iraqis also suiter from trachoma. 3. The next best thing might be Kuwaitis, who are sea- minded, but the objection to employing them is that so many are indentured in the _^earl diving trade under conditions almost of slavery. If they abandoned that calling in favour of piloting', they would be made to suffer in various ways. 4. He incidentally confirms the information 1 reported him as giving me in paragraph 5 of my despatch 10.540 oi September 11th. Yours sincerely, (signed) George Ogilvie Forbes. G• • Rende 1 ^sq. ,C.M.G .Confidential D.O. c- V -v/ Political ngency, Kuwait* 218t Jecember 1934* The Reference paragraph 3 of Ogilvie Forbes' letter of 8th October 1034 to Rendel (forwarded under your j rinted Letter ro.C-317, dated the 19th December) and which you asked me to comment on* 2* I am afraid I must cross swords with Ogilvie Forbes for his unjustified insinuations about Kuwait seamen, and 'that so many are indentured in the pearl diving trade, under conditions almost of slavery etc.' 3. Apart from the actual words used, ana which do not appear to me in the least to bear on the case C&amp;ilvie Forbes is diseussing, I do not think he has any right at all to suggest as he does that the Kuwait Pearl Diving Industry is run on 'slave' lines, seeing that he has never visited Kuwait and cannot know local conditions. 4. AS a matter of actual facts the Kuwait diving fraternity are not badly treated, and if anything tneir lot is a happier one than that of their confreres of Bahrain, who since Major Daly reorganised things and took in hand the betterment of their conditions of service, and finances generally, have never had anything to complain of• 5. It may interest Ogilvie Forbes to know that since my arrival in Kuwait, that is 6 years ago, I have never had a single case of a complaint from a diver, (and there are ample opportunities for him to do this), that he was being uniairly or unjustly treated by his naukhoda(captain) or by his employer if such own several pearling boats* 6* The reason for this is not far to seek. The Shaikh, or his deputy Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir, personally deal with all complaints th-.t come up between divers, naukhodas and owners of boats, and only in very rare and complicated cases Hon’ble Lieut.-Col*T *C.Fowle,C *B.£•, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf •cases are the disputants sent to a sort of 'Saliia' Court conducted by one nbu Gammaz a popular old sea Captain oi knowledge and discretion who has the confidence of the whole sea-faring community. 7. The very fact that Kuwait lies on the nkiinlana ais.es for better treatment of crews and divers generally ior it qhite an easy matter for a sailor to escape into Nejd or over the border into Iraqi if he feels he is suffering harsh treatment or gets so deeply in debt to his employer, as to be virtually a slave. Bad treatment of divers would result in wholesale desertion, which does not occur. 8. On the contrary so po^ula-' is the Divine, business with the Arab of North gast Arabia and so anxious is he to try h:s lick, that in normal years quite 10,000 tribesmen both from Bin Baud’s dominions as well as from the garden districts round Basra, Suk Esh Shuyukh and Nasriyeh in Iraq come down to Kuwait annually to see what God will give them. This figure has been reduced to about 6,000 in the ^ur or five years but only owing to the depression in the pearl trade generally, when some 260 boats instead oi the lull complement of 700 boats have put to sea. 9, Cgilvie Forbes presumably does not know that, oefore a diver goes to the banks he receives an advance oi money from his boat capt-in to enable him to buy a lew luxuries and hand the rest to his family. This advance is anouax-ty fixed by the Shaikh himself (SkLAF) for the whole diving fraternity. Similarly on return from the banks the individual diver gets another advance (TISQAM) to help him through the slack season. This also is fixed by the Shaikh personally. Both amounts are usually in the vicinity of He.40/60 and is quite apart from what he earns as profits from the 'catch'. Apart from the above ti# employers or actual owners oi boa^s, who stay at home are in duty bound to see that their divers' families /-3- iamllies do not get into difficulties when their men folk are at sea* This is also by the Shaikh's orders and the duty is considered an honourable liability* 10* The above advances are supposed to be recovered from the pearl catch and are in 50£ cases so recovered* But if a boat is unlucky and the catch is poor, then the diver cannot pay back his debt till next year* The law allows this and no interest is ever charged* 11* The number of indebted divers in Kuwait is nothing like as much as in Bahrain 1 believe,and certainly not to be compared to the number in ^atar and on the Trucial Coast of Oman where conditions are as different fran Kuwait as chalk differs from cheese* , 12* Divers in Kuwait also have special rights which they do not possess further South - for instance (a) a man's son cannot be taken as a diver in lieu of his father's debts H ^ (b) a wife's property cannot be seized in payment of her deceased husband's (diver) debts ^ ^ 13* There are roughly 700 pe rl boats in Kuwait and 100 ocean-going dhows who go on long Journeys to India, Zanzibar, Red Sea, etc* during the autumn, winter and spring months* Only a few of these ocean-going dhows' crews are divers and their Captains never are* There is nothing to prevent these big dhow capt &gt;ins and most of these sea-faucine crews for that nutter, taking to service as pilots provided they get sufficient ly paid for the work* They are magnificent men and of a breed rarely seen in this 20th Century. 14* Mr*Ogilvle Forbes' statement that if these men abandoned trelr calling in favour of piloting, they would be made to suffer in various ways is ridiculous on the face of it* Kuwait /CONFIDENTIAL.

If ttoy abandoned that calling in favour of piloting, they would be made to suffer in various ways.** 3. I*m afraid I must take some exception to Ogilvie- Forbes* remarks* In the first place this hit st Kuwait seems to me rather gratuitous in the context in which it appears* ^uite apart froi- the Kuwaiti divers, as Cgilvie- Forbes must know there are many Kuwaiti dhows the crews of which are line seamen, and who would certainly be quite willing to become pilots provided they were offarad sufficient pay* There was no reason therefore, as far as 1 can see, for the question of the divers to be brought up* 4* In the second place Cgilvie-1 orbes’ statement that the divers work under conditions almost of slavery is not His d«cellency borne / 3ir F#H*Hus5&gt;hry8 t a.C*M.G.,G*C*V*0*t K • B *^i • , C • X •£» •, His Majesty’s mbassador, Bagdad*- 2 - bome out by actual facts which ara as follows y as suppliad to as in a raport by Dickson* Dickson during his tirua at Kuwait, soma six yaara now, has had no complaints iron divars of bad traatr.snt, though thara liava baai* ample opportunities for divars to make such complaints* Most diving cases ara heard by the Shaikh himself, or hie deputy Shaikh Abdulla, the remainder ox the cases being tried in a local Court unaer one Abu Baseiaz, a retired dhow Captain. The Shaikh, on whom the main responsi bility rests for the conduct of the diving, whatever his faults may be is a humane man, and Abu Gammas has the confidence of the sea-faring community. Moreover motives of expediency enter into the treatment of divers quite apart from those of humanity or justice. Nothing is easier for a diver, if he xeeis he is being harshly treated or harassed over his debts, than to cross the frontier into Nejd or Iraq. Consistent bad treatment of divers would result in wholesale desertions, which would certain ly not suit the Shaikh, and such dfsertions ao not occur. as a matter of fact the diving profession seems to be popular as thousands of individuals come to Kuwait yearly from Nejd arid Iraq to try thair luck on the banks. 5. The following are some details as to how the business side of the diving is conductedi (1) The season lasts about 4 months in every year,i.e* from June to Jeptember. Before a diver goes to the Banks he receives from his boat captain an advance oi money, (fixed by the Shaikh for the whole diving fraternity), for himself and his family. Similarly on return from the Banks the diver gets another advance to help him through until the next season. 3otn advances are about Hs.60/- (2) /@ ® !° -3- (2) The above advances are recovered iron, the alverfe share of the catch y but If the boat is unlucky and the catch poor f then under the diving law the debt is carried forward until next year. Ho interest is charg ed. (3) By the Shaikh^ orders the employers, or actual owners of boats| who stay on shore wheh the diving is in progress f have to see as far as possiole that the divers* families do not get into ditficulties when their men folk are at sea. (4) The son of a deceased diver can only be &amp;&gt;ade to work off his lather's debts by a creditor ix he - the son - wishes to follow in his father's footsteps as a diver. Should the son decide to follow seme other profession he is free to do so arid the creditor nas no claim on his services. (6) The property of the widow of a dsceaseu uiver cannot be seised for debt provided it is registered in her name. 6. I certainly do not wish to pitch my case too high, or to maintain that everything is perfect with regard, to Kuwait divingf or that cases of individual harship do not occur. But such cases are not peculiar to Kuwait* all over the world f even in .jhgland y labour conditions are far from perfect. Luch poverty no doubt exists amongst the Kuwait divers y but one has to re-ember that of late years the bottom has dropped out of the pearl market. The divers themselves y too, work ing in a trade which is in the nature of a gamble on the catch are feckless folk and readily allow themselves to drift into debt, while 1 do not suppose that creditore in Kuwait are / %any more , tendcp»heart.6d than thosa alaawhdr®* Cn tha other hand unlike their colleague* in most other countries they are not allowed to extort interest* 7* In conclusion it appears to iue that ^gilvie-i crbes * statement that the Kuwait divers work M unuer conditions almost of slavery* gives quite a wrong iiqpreaeion, and I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat unfortunate that, before making thia statement in a demi-official letter which has had official circulation, he did not apply either to Dickson or myself for further info mat ion on tne subject* I am sending a copy of this letter to lettealte and Laithwnite• Yours sincerely, scUT.C.Fowle.No.C/43.

In view of the facts (a) that divers can mostly obtain other employment and (b) with the probable expansion of the Japanese cultured pearl industry the Gulf pearl may soon be unable to find a profitable market, it is perhaps no longer necessary to discourage the use of modern diving equipment by local Arabs (but not of course by foreigners). It is arguable that they ought to be .allov/ed to make what they can ou* of the lacal pearl while there is a market left. \ (SGD.) Vv.R.HAY. Lieut.-Colonel A.C.
