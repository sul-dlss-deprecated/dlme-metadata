With reference to your memorandum N 0 o 4 l /53 of 21st September 1935. I think that the following procedure might be adopted. When a Ruler proposes to be away from his Principality for a considerable period and informs me that he is appointing an individual to represent him in his absence, he should at the same time also let me knew whether he wishes the representative to receive the salute due to himself as Ruler - not of course his Personal salute if he happens to possess one. I would then pass this information on to you and the representative would duly be given the salute. 2. Should the Ruler, in the case of a short absence for instance, make no special arrangements for a representative, or appoint a representative but state that - for various reasons - he did not wisha salute to be fired then no question of giving a salute would arise, but see paragraph 5 below. 3. Please see authorities 3-6 shown under paragraph 5 (g) of Section *B' of Article 55 of the East Indies Station Order Book. MUSCAT. The Council of Ministers in question was formed during the time when the late Sultan Taimur bin Faisal refused to live in Muscat, and was in reality a Council of legency to carry on the Government in his perpetual absence, fhen Sultan Taimur abdicated and the present Sultan came to the throne in 1932 the latter dissolved the Council. The present /present Sultan has a Council to the members of which he delegates various administrative duties, but they are not entitled to any salute either collectively or individually. If the suggestion in my preceding paragraph is adopted there would be no question of a Council receiving a salute. The only individual to receive one would be the individual who will represent the Sultan. If this individual is a member of the Ruling Family he will receive 13 guns, otherwise 9. The Sultan may appoint a Council to assist this individual, but that will be merely a matter of administrative convenience from the point of view of the Sultan. I suggest therefore that the authorities 3-6 referred to above be deleted from the Table. 4. Under paragraph 5 (d) and (f) of the same Article the eldest sons of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, if they represent their father, receive a salute of 5 guns. Under the suggestion made in paragraph 2 above should the eldest son be appointed representative, and should the Shaikh wish him to receive a salute, he will receive the salute of 7 guns and not 5. If the son does not represent his father he will of course get no salute. 5. Under paragraph 5 (d) and (f) of the same Article there is the case of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait being absent for a short period having named no representative, or being sick, on the arrival of one of His Majesty’s Ships. In this contingency if the eldest son visits the ship it may be held that he does so as his father’s representative and he can be accorded a salute of 5 guns. 6 . If you concur in the above suggestion you will doubtless approach Kis Excellency the Commander in Chief, East Indies, arid will let me know the result in due course. 7. /7, Tor your information the following are the Personal Salutes of the Rulers His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait 11 guns. « m mm »» Bahrain 11 The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi 5 The Shaikh of Sharjah 5 sd.

SALUTES TO SHAIKHS’ DEPUTIES. With reference to correspondence commencing with my No.41/453 dated 21st September 1935, the Commander-in- Chief, East Indies, has now informed me that he approves in principle the recommendations contained in my No.219/453 dated 1st November 1935 and enclosure, a copy of which is attached. An amended article will be inserted in the revised East Indies Station Order Book in due course. 2 .

Y.S.Butler. CAPTAIN, SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF.Enclosure to S.N^O, &gt; P.G . 1 3 No.9/453 of 25th February 1936, The Senior Naval Officer,Persian Gulf, H.M.S• Shoreham at Bahrain 1st November 1935. No,219/453. Pr om Date The Commander-in-Chief* East Indies Station To SALUTES TO HITLERS* DEPUTIES IN ARABIAN WATERS With reference to my No.190/587 dated 6 th September 1935, paragraphs 36 to 39, the opinion of the Honourable the political Resident has been obtained, and the following procedure is now recommended. 2. When a Ruler proposes to leave his Principality, he should inform the Honourable the Political Resident whether he is appointing a representative to act in his absence, and if so, his name and whether he desires that this individual should receive a salute. This notification would then be passed to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 3. As a rule, the son of the Ruler is seldom appointed in his father’s absence, although provision has been made for this in East Indies Station Order Book, Article 55, Section 3, for Bahrain and Kuwait. If the son was however appointed to act in this capacity, he would be entitled to a salute of 7 guns at these places in accordance with paragraph 2 above. 4. There is also the contingency at Kuwait and Bahrain, of the Shaikh being absent for a short period having named no representative, or being sick, on the arrival of one of H.M. Ships. The Honourable the Political Resident suggests that in this event, if the eldest son visits the ship, it may be held that he does so as his father’s repnesentative, and in accordance v/ith the present Article 55, he could then be accorded a salute of 5 guns. It is thought, however, that such a provision might be confusing, and that it would be best to limit the salute to the eldest son, to the occasion set out in paragraph 3 above. 5. As regards Muscat, the present Sultan dissolved the Council of Ministers or Regency Council referred to in Article 55, on his accession to the throne in 1932. He later appointed a number of councillors for various administrative duties, but the Honourable the Political Resident does not consider that they are entitled to any salute either collect ively or individually. The only individual entitled to receive a salute is the Sultan’s representative - 13 guns if a member of the Ruling Family, otherwise 9. 6 . In no case would the deputy receive the Ruler’s personal salute. Eor convenience, it is suggested that these should be inserted in Article 55. The amendments suggested above have b een included in a draft /- 2 - draft Article 55, Section B, which is forwarded herewith for your consideration. The flag amendments proposed in No.393/E.I.2632 have not been included as Admiralty sanction has not yet been received. sd. V.S.Butler. Captain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Oulf. Enel. No.1.
