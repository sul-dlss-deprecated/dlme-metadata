Mr. Maicola 5 2. MR. URN DEL recoiled that the Tandi Government had been repeatedly Invited tc send delegates to Bahrain in order to discuss with the Bahrain Government the ques tion of commercial relations between the two States. He was doubtful, however, whether the Saudi Government would agree to such a conference while they were still in doubt whether or not His Majesty's Government were trying to bloc (cade the Hana coast. It mi^it be necessary to mafct a definite statement of policy to the Taudl Government in onler to persuade them to accept an Invitation. 3 . 3IH A. BYAN stated that his conversation with Xing Tbn 'tend at Taif previous to his departure on leave had convinced him that the King felt with great intensity about this subject, more particularly in regard to what he conceived....conceived to b« T fi« Majesty*? GeveramenVs boycott of hie et+e^pte to develop tlie Maea coeet. He tack umbrage at anything iR the nature of except.ioiJtl treatment of Mb porta an compared with others in the Qulf. He already believed that the Bahrain Government, who® he identified with ”l«j rsje«ty*s Oovemmert, were preventing chips from carrying cargo direct to the Far* coast. Such a notifica tion hy the Bahrain Government with regard to vessels carrying direct cargo for the mainlsrid as Colonel Fowle had proposed In Ms letter Ho.578/8 of the 25th June to Vr. Laithwnite, would only intensify King Ibr. Sand's grlovance. 4. COLCtSL FOWLS explained that his proposel had been Intended as ro more than o tentative suggestion, r and that in the light of the views expressed by the Foreign Office (see J/r. Mendel's letter of to Mr. Lp.lthvra.ite) and the Board of Trade in regard to It, he was willing to withdraw It. 5. The discussion then panned to the question of the tactics to he adopted vla-a-vis of King Ibn aud ir. dealing with teis dispute. Anmming that the vpiestion of the economic relations between Bahrain and 'ro.jdi Arabia would have to he include! among the subjects discussed in the propose! genera’, negotiations between ''is Majesty's Government and the Cauil Government (and the meeting agreed that this question must in fact be pooled with other out standing questions in the t:! s negotiations) it was necessary to draft a line of policy for Hr A. Hyan's guidance, ’’’here were two distinct aspects of this question: (a ^ ■(a) King Itm Hand daalred an assurance from His Majesty's Government that the hostile attitude of Bahrain towards direct shipments to Hasa, the moat striking example of which was the *Ahmedi' case, did not represent the consistent policy of the Bahrain Govern ment or Hie Majesty's Government. (b) Apart from this question of direct shipment to Hasa ports, there was also the question of the rate at which the transit dues levied by the Bahrain Government on goode for the mainland were to be fixed. 6 . 31th regard to (a) the first point that arose was whether It was permissible or desirable to use the possibility of a policy of 'blockade' as a threat to Induce Ibn laud to agree to a conference at Bahrain. 7. MH. BAITHWAITE suggested that, although It wae clearly desirable to arrange a conference at Bahrain If this could possibly be managed, ultimately, if the 'Saudi Government proved unaccommodating, a policy In the sense indicated by the Bahrain Government's action in the 'Ahmedl* case might be Justified on grounds of necessity. The ihelkh of Bahrain could not afford to lose the money which came to him from Bahrain's transit trade and his action In defence of this trade could be Justified on those same grounds of urgent economic necessity which Fuad Bey Hamaa had recently invoked in defence of the Gaudi blockade of Koweit. It therefor* seemed legitimate at least to threaten King Ibn Gaud4. n tn^, ’ , * ns ®. and perhaps a 1ev*r to s«atp e th» lifting of the Koweit blockade. could only bo Jtmmed nc s dlrtct ntnwire of Tot^l «fi.tlon t/hg Kowol't Mockndo • and it. had heon of rood that, two were ferloua ebjactiona to #ct*bli«hin£ any dlroct connexion the^a two ona^tiona. Moroova^ the Infl^anca enjoyed by Hie 'rovem^mt in Arabia nnd thr Persian Golf raatad in fact partly on their not naing such retaliatory methods. Two Macke did not r^ke a whlt&lt;» and we should fain nothing by using the illegiti mate methods sometimes practised by our adveMarlta. ^■rfhtr, the &lt; 5audi Oovernr-ent had already been nsmirad that the * Ahmeii ' Incident did not represent n settled policy, and that r fie Majesty's Govemfiient did not Intend to blockade tT ara.- - — . 9. SIR A. RYAN added that, in his view, the 3audi blockade of Kowelt and the suggested Bahraini blockade of the Hasa ports were not really parallel. A precedent for the first might perhaps be found elsewhere, but it would in Sir A Ryan’s opinion be contrary to all civilized practice to prohibit the carriage of goods, by way of through shipment, to the Hasa coastunder penalty of the Slips not being allowed to call at Bahrain or compelled to pay transit dues there. He considered that His Majesty's Government would not be able to Justify these extraordinary measures which constituted King Ibn Saud's main grievance. In replying to the Saudi complaixtHis Majesty's Government must either deny that they, or the Bahrain Govern Tent, were preventing British shipping from making direct shipments to the Hasa coast or they must admit it. He suggested that a possible course might be to admit that the British India Company were acting under some pressure from the Bahrain Government and in the light of their own Interests, but to add that His Majesty's Government would not actually encourage the Company to adopt another policy unless a satisfactory general settlement were reached between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. 10. MR.RENDEL objected that this might result in an awkward discussion with the Saudi Govern;ent as to the • • • •to the extent to which action could be taken by His Majesty’s Government to facilitate direct shipments, and that such discussion might end in His Majesty's Gov rnment being engaged in more active intervention than they had contemplated. On the main point at issue he added that it seemed unlikely that King Ibn 3aud would agree to a conference until he knew whether a blockade were seriously threatened or not. In view of this and also of the irregularity of a blockade policy, he proposed that King Ibn 3aud should be approached on the following lines. No blockade would be imposed on Saudi ports; on the other hand the transit dues were essential to the finances of Bahrain. His Majesty's Government trust therefore, once again invite the Saudi Government to discuss the general question of their conmercial relations with Bahrain at a conference. If a satisfactory general settlement were reached at this conference. His Majesty's Government would undertake to see that the transit dues were not raised above a certain point. This would enable His Majesty's Government to make the proposal ibr a conference attractive to the Saudi Government without necessitating the employment of a threat of doubtful legitimacy. 11. 3IK A. KYAN11. UIH A HYAN agreed generally. He then further elaborated Mr. Handel *a suggestion and proposed that the following line should he taken with the Saudi Government on their being once again invited to a conference at Bahrain:* (a) The baud! Government should h* assured once again that the action of the Bahrain Government in connexion with the 'Ahmedi' Incident did not represent a settled policy. (b) As regards the attitude of British shipping towards direct shipments to Hesa, the daudi Government might he told that His ^jesty’s Government were unable to dictate a policy to the interests concerned, who naturally followed their own advantage. His i^ajesty 1 * Government would, however, ensure that the Bahrain Government did not exercise undue pressure. (c) The Bahrain Government were entitled to raise the transit duos. ilr A. Hyan very much doubted, in spite of the renewed representations which had recently been made to them, whether the Saudi Government would agree to a conference without receiving beforehand an assurance that His Majesty's Goveranent did not intend to enforce a blockade of the Hasa ports. Such an assurance might nevertheless be confined to the most general terms and it might be hinted to the ;^audi Government that. If they proved obdurate, the transit dues might be raised against thera.12. m. LAI TH WAITE suggested that King I bn Seud might refuse to negotiate under a threat. a. r{YAf4 agreed, but observed that If King Ibn Saud did decline the proposal for h conference, he might be told that the Bahrain Government must recompense themselves for the lack of any satisfactory commercial arrangement with Saudi Arabia by raising the dues. The question then arose whether any raising of the dues in these or similar circumstances should extend to the levying of duei&gt; on those goods which at present pass into oaudi Arabia free as being for the King’s personal use. &amp;IR A. .RYAN recommended that goods which were genuinely for King Ibn baud’s own use should in any case continue to enjoy exemption, since his resentment at the removal of this privilege might do more damage to Anglo-baud! relations than its abolition could profit Bahrain. Mr. LAITHWAITE inclined to the view that, if failure to reach an agreement resulted in an economic war, even King Ihn baud’s personal stereo could not be passed over. As it was, he appeared to be receiving under this exemption consignments very much larger than the needs of his household would seem to warrant, e.g. 30*000 bags of rice, and it might be assumed that the surplus went to the tribes. 159. 13. On the main issue MR. LAITHmAITK and COLONciL WDWLt; concurred generally In the course proposed by Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite proposed, however, that the assurance regarding the blockade should only be given, if the Saudi Government refused to attend the conference unless they received it. He also preferred that His Majesty's Government should not specifically uncertake to ensure that the Bahrain Government did not bring pressure to bear on the shipping companies. He suggested further that the Saudi Government might be warned that if they should develop Has Tanurah or other Hasa ports in aggressive opposition to Bahrain, they must expect the transit dues to be raised. Finally, if the Saudi Government particularly desired that the negotiations at Bahrain should be tripartite, j\ they might be told that the Political Resident or the Political Agent, Bahrain, would assist the | conference. 14. MR. RSNUSL also agreed to the course proposed. The threat to raise the transit dues ana, in his view, a legitimate bargaining counter, whereas the threat of a blockade was not. 15. • • • •10 . 15* MR* LAITHWAITiS in conclusion suggested that it might be possible to say to the Saudi Government that, if they would agree to negotiate at Bahrain, His Majesty*s Government for their part would advise the Bahrain Government not to exercise for the time being their undoubted sovereign rights and raise the dues. A summary of the course of action agreed upon by the meeting was then dictated, which is given below as amended later by Sir A* Ryan: !• It is still the policy of His Majesty’s Govemraent to press for an early discussion of this question at a Saudi-Bahraini conference, to be held at Bahrain, with the assistance of the political authorities, to explore all the issues and endeavour to arrive at a settlement which would be confirmed in due course through the diplomatic channel. See the 1952 correspondence, the record of Sir A. Ryan’s conversa tion with Ibn Baud at Taif on July 15th last and the record of the conversation with Fuad Bey Hamsa at the Foreign Of lice on September 21. 2. If the Saudi Government now agree to this local con ference and a settlement acceptable to the Governments con cerned results from it, cadit quacstio . If a settlement joes not result, the ground will be clear for further discussion with the Saudi Government in the course of the genera negotiations contemplated after Sir A. Ryan returns to Jedda. 5. If, as a condition of agreeing to the local conference the Saudi Government press for a statement by His Majesty s Government as to their attitude regarding the imposition of restrictions by Bahrain on direct shipments to the Ha fa Coast, Mr. Calvert, or In due course Sir A. Ryan, is authorised to make a statement on the following lines, using discretion/11 . discretion as to the precise form to be given to it:- (a) The action of the Bahrain authorities at the time of the isolated Ahmedi incident was an expedient adopted by them in conditions of urgency and did not represent a considered policy of His Majesty's Government. (b) Neither His Majesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government have forbidden shipping companies to accept cargo for direct shipment to the Hasa Coast, under penalty of not being allowed to call at Bahrain, although, in the single case of the Ahmedi, transit duty was claimed. His Majesty's Government cannot in fact issue instructions to shipping companies regarding such matters in normal circumstances. It is for the companies themselves to consider applications for facilities for direct shipment, having regard to all the factors affecting them, including such regulations as may be made by the Bahrain Government in the exercise of their sovereign rights. (c) His Majesty's Government are, however, anxious to promote the removal of all causes of difficulty in connexior with the general question of shipments for iiasa. If the local conference is agreed to and produces favourable results, they will urge the Bahrain Government to reirain from any future action analogous to that taken in the case of the Ahmedi. (d) It is owing to the influence of His Majesty's Government, which was exerted strongly with the Bahrain Government in 1920, that Saudi importers have for many years enjoyed the benefit of a very favourable rate of transit duty, which has in recent years been insufucient l to/to cover tbe cost of the increased facilities provided at Bahrain for goods in transit. 1 His Majesty's Government cannot, however, ignore the importance of the transit trade to the economic life of Bahrain. While recognising that the fostering of direct trade to the Saudi nmjnipnd is a matter entirely within the rights of the Saudi Government, they must equally recognise that any consider able diversion of trade from its present channels would seriously affect the revenues of Bahrain and would necessarily compel the Bahrain Government to compensate themselves by raising the dues on goods continuing to pass through Bahrain. The interests of Bahrain and Hasa must continue to be interdependent for many years to come and the case is one for a mutual accommodation of those interests. (e) His Majesty's Government consider that this statement should remove any misgiving on the part of the Saudi Government as to their attitude, which is inspired solely by their desire to promote the desired accomuodfition oi 1 interests, as a result of a free exchange of views between experts qualified by local knowledge to advise on the best means of attaining it. 4. If the Saudi Government should now agree to the loca,. conference and its proceedings should nevertheless be delayed by insistence on the Saudi side on the grievances alleged by Ibn Saud, the Political Agent will have authority to make a statement on the above lines at any stage, where it may seem to him appropriate. 5 ./5. The Saudi Government have made a special point of urging that goods consigned to Ibn Saud or his Government should be exempted from transit dues. If the local conference is agreed to, this point will doubtless be raised and it will be necessary to define the scope of any such exemption* If no settlement is arrived at* it may become necessary, not only to raise the dues, but to restrict the exemption or to refuse any exemption whatsoever, even in the case of goods for Ibn Baud's personal use. It is left to the discretion of the Legation in Jedda and the Political Agent to include a hint as to the ultimate possibility of a severe restriction of existing exemptions in any statement on the above lines, but care should be taken to avoid any premature pronouncement which might be construed as a threat aimed at Ibn Saud personally*Ah INDIA OPPIGS, ^&lt; 1.2 mimiALL, LONDON, 3.W. 1. P.Z.6267/34 12th October 1934 My dear Powle, ^ I fear that the minutes of the discussion at the Foreign Office which you and pyan attended on 8th October are not yet available. The Foreign Office lave, however, sent me a redraft, which I enclose, prepared by R/an, of the proposed instructions on the subject of Bahrein Transit Dues. There is, I think, no difference of substance except that less emphasis is laid on the question of the handling of the threat of withdrawing the exemption for goods consigned to Ibn 3aud personally. There seems no objection to the modification embodied in paragraph 5 of the draft on this point. 2.

This question is Tor discussion at the Foreign Office on ftonaay afternoon with Colonel Fowle. The position in regard to it is set out in my note helow. I discussed it at some length with Colonel Fowle yesterday afternoon and we came to the conclusion that: (a) on the general question the only thing to oo was to continue to press the Sauui^s (and if necessary the Foreign Office) to agree to an informal discussion with Bahrein, as the result of wnich some friendly arrangement could he come to; (h) it was not only not possible to have a succession of /dimedi incidents, but that it would be difficult to avoid^gTving Ibn Baud the direct answer which he wants (so that he can pass it on to the shipping companies) - that obstacles such as were employed in the Anmedi incident will not be placed in the w'ay of shipping companies or individuals who wish to carry cargo either direct or through Bahreini waters to the Rasa coast. On the other hand, it would, of course, be desirable to avoid any positive statement until tne conference had taken place in Bahrein and if possible to leave it to tne Bahreini representatives at the conference to give a categorical assurance that there would be no repetition of the incident, in return for some concession on tne Saudi sloe. (c) it would be advisable to drop the proposal recently put forward by the Resident lor criticism in regard to the discouragement of direct shipment to/to toe ttainlana ^la ^tif by Japanese vessels, the political arguiiients against pressing it advanced in utiv roreign oxiice letter oelow being accepted as decisive. ‘ s * y° u agree we will take this line at the conference. 30 far as I know it will entirely satisfy hie foreign Office ana Sir Andrew Ryan . But we must of course continue to urge the importance of leaving nothing undone to secure tne interests of Bahrein. 7 • L vitalMinute Paper. pol i :i gal Departm ent. There are two questions tor consiaeration in connection with the Bahrein transit cues; (a) the general question of an agreement between Sauai Arabia and Bahrein; (b) the proposal recently put forward by tne Political Resident that, with a view to discouraging direct shipment to the mainland at q,atif by Japanese vessels, the Bahrein Government might notify in gooa time that they would not permit vessels which carriea direct cargo for the mainland to call on the same trip at Bahrein. 2. As regards the first of these questions, it will be remembered that in 1920 certain concessions to Ibn 3 auu in regard to transit traffic were forced on the Sheiich of Banrein Dj H.L. G. In particular, the Sheikh agreed to cnarge duty only on transit gooas consigned to the mainland provided that these were removed from the Bahrein Customs House within 20 days from the date of landing; and to charge no duty on goons for the mainland transhipped from steamers direct into lighters which proceeded to the mainland. 3. In June 1932 an informal understanding was reached between Bahrein and Ion Baud's agent, Ibn Jalouwi, which allowed Bahrein a 2,% duty on transhipped cargo destined xor Sauai Arabia, even if transnippea directly into lighters. 4 . Later in the same year an agreement was reached between Bahrein and one harzuk, a merchant interested in the trade witn Saudi ^rabia, under which terzuk agreed to pay a transhipment cnarge of 2% 2621 6000 3 342% if he were allowed overside delivery within Bahrein waters, to ship consignments of not less than 3000 hags at a time, and to refrain in future from ? fir chartering vessels for carrying cargo direct from the mainland, 5. In November 1932 there occurred the case of the AHL/EDI. This vessel having arrived at Bahrein with cargo both for Bahrein and for Saudi Arabia and having refused to pay duty on the latter, which it was not proposed to tranship in Bahrein waters, was not allowed to land her cargo for Bahrein, whereupon she sailed to Has T^nura ana landed the whole of her cargo there. 6 . The action of the Bahreini Government in tnis case, while it may have been within their sovereign powers, was regarded by the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office as being extremely high-hanaed, and prima facie it appears difficult to justify a demand for payment of transit dues on goods not landed in Bahrein. The deterrent effect of the incident was, however, apparently complete, and since it occurred there have been no lurther endeavours to ship cargo in bulk ^or the Hasa coast via Bahrein, Bahrein duty being evaded on the ground that the bulk was not broker in Bahreini waters. Ion Baud has repeatedly requested H.M.G. to state whether the AHkEDI incident represents a settied policy designed to interfere with direct shipment to the Hasa ports. He states that since the incident in question it is impossible to interest shipping companies in direct shipments to his ports and tnat tl eifect is incidentally to make it difficult for him to proceed with the development of the port of has mnura He is anxious for a positive statement by H.M.G. that vjl ' incident does not represent hd that it will not reoccur. a settled policMinute Paper » 2621 6000 3 34 Department. ^• H.fVi.G. have consistently urged that this Question he dealt with locally at an iniormal conference between Saudi and Bahreini representatives with wnicn trie Political Agent should he associated. Ihn Saud has hitherto refused to agree to such a conference, hut Fuad Hamza, in tne recent discussions^ which took place at tne Foreign Office, agreed again to urge tne King to ao so. so far as tne general question is concerned we must a/vait the result of Fuad Hamza's efforts. 9. The second question for consideration is the desirability ana practicability of the Political resident's suggestion for deterring direct shipment to the Hasa coast by Japanese ships. The Board of Trade would regard action on the lines proposed by him as somewhat high-handed, but express doubt whether the Transit Convention, ior example, would apply, seeing that the vessels would call at Bahrein for tne purpose of trade ana not merely of transit ana that so long as tne re is no discrimination a country would seem entitled to grant access to its ports to what vessels it pleases. They assume that the provision would be of general application ana would apply also to Britisn vessels. 10. The Foreign Office, while agreeing that the proposed measure might technically avoid a charge of discrimination insofar as it would oe equally applied to shipping of all nationalities and that it might oe legally within Bahrein's sovereign rights, strongly urge that approval should not be given to it. Its effect upon Ibn Saud, whatever technical justification there might be, would be most unfortunate ai^d would not/1not merely 'oe calculated to reduce the prospects of any friendly settlement of the dispute about Bahrein transit aues, but would in all probabilit/greatly reduce, if not altogether remove, any hope of a satisfactory general settlement between H.L.G. and Sauai Arabia. Tney lurther suggest tnat Banrein woulq inevitably be exposed to a charge of discrimination on the ground that their action would be peculiar to ships wishing to trade with the Hasa coast, and that its effect might be to stimulate the Sauai Government to develop Hasa ports and make themselves independent of Bahrein, and that from the British standpoint the aai^-er of a Japanese service to all ports except Bahrein out including Has iknura might be considerable ^ think on the whole that the arguments, particularly the political arguments, advanced by the Foreign Office against accepting the Resident’s proposal are decisive ana that Bahrein must thee her chance. But the threat of Japanese competition makes it all the more urgent to reach if possible a moous iOvenui with sauai Arabia on the matters in dispute and is an additional argument for pressing the Sauai Government to agree to an informal discussion at Bahrein on the lines that have previously been contemplated.In any further communication _Dn this subject, please quote ^No. e 4707/101/25 and address— not to any person by name. but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,' Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. V/ *esi 100 1 » /| f t 6159 | :'/ .Eor eignJ Office. s,W.l* 1st October, 1954. Sir, it With reference to India Office letter No. PZ.4687/34 of the 18th July, regarding Bahrain transit dues, I am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he has had under consideration the proposal put forward by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Bahrain Government should forbid vessels which carry direct cargo for the mainland to call at Bahrain on the same voyage. 2. From previous official and semi-official correspondence between the Foreign Office and India Office on this subject and in particular from Mr. Rendel’s letter No® E 142/101/25 of the 31st January to Mr. Laithwaite, Sir Samuel Hoare will be aware that Sir John Simon views with serious misgiving the present policy of the Bahrain Government with regard to the Hasa coast trade, which appears to him to 'be not only contrary to ordinary international practice in these matters but also detrimental to relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Government and possibly even to the best interests of the Bahrain Government themselves. The effect of Colonel Fowle’s present proposal would be to invest with the character of a public and settled policy the principles which inspired the action of the Bahrain Government in the isolated case of the Ahmedi. The adoption of so drastic an expedient in the hope of safeguarding the position/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office®position of the Bahrain Government - an object which incidentally it seems most ill-calculated to achieve - appears to Sir John Simon to he open to objection under each of the three heads mentioned above. 3. So far as international practice is concerned, Sir John Simon observes that in a semi—olficial letter ot the 5th September to Mr. Laithwaite, Mr. Marker of the Board of Trade characterises the procedure suggested by Colonel Fowle as high-handed. With this description Sir John Simon fully agrees. Although the proposed measure might technically avoid the charge of discrimination in regard to trade with Hasa insofar as it would be equally applied to shipping of all nationalities, the action suggested, even though legally within Bahrain’s sovereign rights, would certainly be open to the accusation that it was in fact an attempt to dictate the channels through which seaborne trade with the Hasa coast must pass. It would also expose the Bahrain Government to the charge of discrimination of a different kind, as it would be peculiar to ships wishing to trade with the Hasa Coast. Ships wishing to carry direct cargo to that Coast would be debarred from calling at Bahrain on the same voyage but no such prohibition would apply to ships with direct cargo for non-Saudi ports such as Basra, Debai, or the ports of the Persian coast. 4* On these grounds the proposed action would most certainly be resented by the Saudi Government. Prom the memorandum by His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda recording his conversations with King Ibn Saud at Taif in July, a copy of Which was enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. K 5063/2499/25 of/of the 27th August to the India Office, it is clear that the steps already taken hy the Bahrain Government in the matter of transit dues and direct shipments to the Hasa Coast have aroused King Ihn Baud’s 'bitterest resentment. The 'burden of King Ihn Baud’s complaint is that His Majesty’s Government - for he persists in attaching the true responsibility for this matter to His Majesty’s Government rather than the Bahrain Government have been trying to make him economically dependent upon Bahrain and to place him in such a position that it would be a waste of money for him to develop his own ports, only to see them rendered useless by a British boycott. A public notice in the terms contemplated by Colonel Fowle could only confirm him in this belief. In paragraph 6 of his letter Colonel Fowle admits that the action which he proposes would probably not be received with equanimity by the Saudi Government, but he suggests that any unpleasantness from that quarter must be faced* Clearly, however, it is not a case of rousing a passing irritation, but of exciting in King Ibn Baud a rancorous hatred of the methods employed by the Bahrain Government in what he not unnaturally regards as an attempt to secure a stranglehold on the import trade of Hasa. 5. Finally, it appears open to question whether the action proposed would in fact be in the best interests of the Bahrain Government themselves. While not wishing to press his views on a point which is primarily the concern of the India Office and the local authorities, Sir John Simon feels bound to suggest that, in view of King Ibn Saud’s attitude, the present policy of the Bahrain Government may well in the end defeat its own object by stimulating the Saudi Government, and/that this settlement should include many questions of great ■''* importance to the A.rah Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, more especially those of the Koweit blockade, of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia and oi the Bahrain transit dues. The desirability of such a settlement mas urged upon the Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs during his recent visit to London and the possible items in it mere discussed individually. -Puad Bey Hamza agreed in principle to the general proposal, though naturally subject to the approval of King Ibn Saud. At the end of the conversation relating particularly to the Bahrain transit dues, Fuad Bey agreed to make a further attempt to persuade King Ibn Saud to send a Saudi delegation to Bahrain in order to discuss the transit dues question. 8. Apart from the general arguments against Colonel Fomle’s proposal, therefore, it appears desirable at least to postpone any action in the sense he suggests, at any rate until it is known, whether Fuad Bey's representations have induced King Ibn Saud to agree to a conference, or whether, failing this, the proposal for a general settlement, including the transit dues problem, will be found practicable. In any case, it is clear from King Ibn Saud's conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan at Taif, ttat action in the sense proposed by Colonel Fowle would in all probability provoke the King to such indignation that it would prove fatal to any hope of promoting a settlement at all. in these circumstances Sir John Simon hopes that the idea of any such action will not be approved by Sir Samuel Hoare. 9. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Board of Trade and Department of Overseas Trade. I am, S i Your obedient Servant,7u^u. F-^ Zi . c&lt;{3^- 16. tinally, the question of the Bahrein Transit Dues was raised. Fuad Bey explained that there were two difficulties confronting his Government in this matter: firstly, the question of the transit dues themselves; and, secondly, ^ the question of direct shipments to the Hasa coast. As regards the first of these, the Saudi Government feared that the Bahrein Government were about to raise ^ the dues, if they had not already done so. They considered, moreover, that any consignments addressed either to King Ibn Baud or to the Saudi Government should be exempted from dues. 17. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that for some time past the negotiations on this subject had been transferred to London, and that, although he had been kept informed, he had not been directly concerned in this matter, until during his recent audience with King Ibn Baud at Taif the King had raised with him the question of direct shipments. He pointed out that it was scarcely fair of the Saudi Government both to demand that the Bahrein Government should reduce the rates of the dues and at the same time endeavour to kill the Bahrein transit trade. Bahrein must live. 18. Mr. Rendel stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already represented fully at the Foreign Office the views of his Government on this subject. His Majesty’s Government, for their part, had suggested that a Saudi delegation should be sent to Bahrein, to examine whether the issue between the Saudi and Bahrein Governments could not be narrowed down if not removed altogether. He suggested that this was, in fact, the most practical means of settling this question, that the Saudi Government could not prejudice their case by sending such a delegation, and that if the discussions should fail they would still be free to pursue the matter with His Majesty’s Government direct. The question, particularly as regards the dues, was a complicated and technical one, where local data would be necessary, and which could be dealt with far more effectively on the spot than in London or in Jedda. He felt sure that such a local meeting would do much to clear the air, even if it did not lead to a final settlement, and he suggested that preliminary discussions of this nature might well take place at once. Sir A. Ryan would not be back in Jedda until December, so there was plenty of time to explore the ground locally meanwhile. If the proposed local discussions should lead to nothing, and the Saudi Government should have reasonable grounds for considering the attitude of the Bahrein Government to be unreasonable, it would still be possible to bring the matter into the scope of the general discussions with Sir A. Ryan after his return to Jedda. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had always considered Saudi Arabia and Bahrein to be jointly interested in this matter, subject to a proviso that with the passage of time this common interest might weaken or vanish. He had throughout been convinced, and was still convinced, that the best method of arriving at a solution would be that which His Majesty’s Government had proposed, namely, a discussion at Bahrein on a purely practical basis, with the object of arriving at an agreement which should be concluded for a limited period of, say, five years. Such a discussion, conducted by such local experts as, say, Mahomed at Tawil on the Saudi side, and the Financial Adviser, with the assistance of the British Political Agent, on the Bahreini side, would, in his opinion, offer every prospect of a settlement. He had again urged this solution at Taif, but King Ibn Baud appeared to be obsessed by the feeling that His Majesty’s Government were inclined to boycott the development of the Hasa ports. Mr Rendel explained that His Majesty’s Government had no wish to boycott or blockade Hasa or to interfere with its development. But, m any case if the Saudi Government could not obtain reasonable satisfaction at the proposed local conference, they would still be able to raise this question during the general oJ-'-CQpartnaem Draft Paper. Department. 1 ^ discussions at Jedda. Mr. Rendel saw nothing to be lost and much to be gained from the proposed local discussions. Fuad Bey explained that he could not depart from his instructions on this question. He undertook, however, to suggest once more to the King the possibility of local discussion at Bahrein and to put to His Majesty the arguments which had been used. He quite realised that Bahrein must find some means of economic existence, but such an existence should not be parasitic. If Bahrein wished to live by its transit dues, it must give reasonable facilities. This would not be the case if the transit dues were raised, and in any case King Ibn Baud felt strongly that goods consigned to himself and his Government should be exempted. Mr. Rendel said that so far as he was aware it was not in accordance with general practice to exempt from transit dues stores destined for a foreign Government. Sir Andrew Ryan stated that His Majesty’s Government had always been ready to give liberal treatment to stores destined for the actual use of King Ibn Baud. The economy of Nejd, however, was of a peculiar kind, and there seemed no good reason wTiy stores which were, for instance, imported foi the use of tribes should be exempted from transit dues. Fuad Hamza then reverted to the question of direct shipments to Hasa^ He emphasised the importance which King Ibn Baud attached to this, and added that local interests in Saudi Arabia, Basra, and even Persia weie now considering the possibility of forming some independent navigation company, in view of the pressure which had been brought to bear on the Butish India Company not to make any shipments to the Hasa direct. force him into economic dependence on Bahrein, and Mr. Rendel repeated that His Majesty’s Government had no wish to bring about a boycott or blockade ot the Hasa coast. 2800 5000 5 34CONFIDENTIAL.

After hearing it, the ng said he had something further to speak about. His Majesty’s Government re worried about restrictions on trade with Koweit. What of restrictions on ' i( ^ e w ifh Nejd ? I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action r ken at Bahrein in regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under Tie impression that “the Government' had prohibited such shipments. On my asking whether he meant His Majesty's Government or the Bahrein Government he laughed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that I knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrein Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrein, by a ship which had tried to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrein and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be referred to higher authority, but that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently proposed a discussion of the whole subject of transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Govern ment had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that I had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, he said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Ras Tanura ? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Ras Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there. Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty’s Government could not in normal times direct the movements of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elicited the admission that he could not substantiate the allegation, though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view that the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Majesty’s Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrein and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative for a fixed time. 24. The chief interest of this discussion was the revelation it afforded of the King’s bitter personal resentment. He threw out references which I did not understand, to other countries like Japan, &amp;c., and their attitude towards similai problems. He clung to his grievance long after the latest hour at which he told me he could say his prayers. It was well after 9 when I was able to leave him. 25 Shortly before 10, Sheikh Yussuf called again to deliver the Arab clothes, which I had consented to receive. At 4 a.m. next day he was on the spot once more to see me off. I delayed my departure a short time for a final word about the Bahrein question. I said I had been impressed by the King’s anxiety to treat the question of direct shipments as a separate issue. 1 did not wish His Majestv to think that I had been difficult the previous evening, and assured him that on my return to London I would go into the whole matter.. 26 The forea‘oin«' account of my conversation at lair is accurate on all main points, but is not an exact record of all that passed, e.g., as legalds the seouence of the individual discussions. For one thing my interpreter was far from well, and the King tried him very high, by delivering long speeches, impossible to render in all their details after he had let himself go. I have omitted various non-essentials, e.g., the King, when foreshadowing future trouble Northern Arabia referred to conversations with Captain Shakespear, m which he had similarly foreshadowed the Great War; and, in professing his friendship for His Majesty’s Government, he described his confidence in them as being unaffected by the suggestion of Turks and others that His Majesty s Government were, in reality, hostile to him. genuinely •27 The general impression I derived was that the is gei i y is extremely bitte ‘‘blue line ” He is almost equallv bitter over the as ssr siz * *» * s 4Extract from Intelligence Report of Political Agent, Bahrain, for period 16th to 31st July, 19o4. x x X 88.

I enclose a copy of a note dated/the 2nd June 1934 from Loch regarding the possibility of direct shipments to the mainland(Qatif) by Japanese vessels. 2 . The threat of more or less regular direct ship ments by Japanese vessels is a more serious one than that arising from isolated cases like the ,, Ahmedi M , and ohe Bahrain Government will naturally wish to do all in their power to prevent its being put into effect. 3 # Though the action of the Bahrain Government in the ’’Ahmedi 11 case was generally held, I think, to be within their sovereign powers, the fact that a demand was made for payment of transit dues on goods not landed at Bahrain was the cause of some doubt in certain quarters. 4 # in the present instance it seems to me thatj if the Bahrain Government were to notify in good time that they would not permit vessels which carried direct cargo for the mainland to call on the same trip at Bahrai^ they would discourage the mainland traffic without in any way over stepping their powers. There would be no demand lor payment of transit dues on cargo carried for the mainland, and/ J.G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, London.- 2 - and provided due notice was given there could be no cause of complaint from shippers or steamship companies. Nor could the Japanese complain of discrimination as the notificatio would apply to all vessels. 5. If this line were taken the Japanese line might decide that their general Bahrain trade was worth more to them than the shipments to the mainland, and refuse to carry the latter, in which case the object of the Bahrain Government would be achieved. On the other hand the Japanese might decide that the mainland trade was more valuable than the Bahrain trade, in which case they would not call at Bahrain and British trade or at any rate British shipping (i.e. the B*X*) would benefit accordingly* 6 . It is possible that the Saudi Government may not view this move on the part of the Bahrain Government with equanimity, but in view of the great financial importance to Bahrain of its transit trade any unpleasantness from that quarter must be faced. After all we are not responsible for the financial propsperity of Saudi Arabia, but we are m a measure for that of Bahrain, of whose normal revenues very large proportion comes from customs receipts, and of • this a very large proportion again consists of transit dues. , « i .p OT » thp views of the vurious 7# I would be grateful for the view* Departments concerned. • r. rt-f* + Uric; letter to Metcalfe I am sending copies of this xeuue and Ryan. —*Visit of a Japanese ship to Bahrain. 1. Karko Bunya of the firm of Haridas Janinal and Coup any of Balirain has informed me that Messrs Kawji Jahawsrchand and Company, the Agents of his firm in Karachi, in M-rch contracted with the Japanese Cotton Trading Company for the import into Bahrain of 1000 tons of Hangoon rice, which had previously been shipped to Japan, by a Japanese steamer. Under the terms this contract the monopoly for shipments of Japanese rice to the port of Bahrain during the months of April, .lay and June was given to the firm of Haridas Janim&amp;l and Company. The Japanese steamer (S.S.Nankana Mara) is due to reach Bahrain in the middle of this month ul&amp;y ;. 2. Recently the firm of knhamoad '.arzuq, whose Agent in Bahrain is ’Abdul ’Aziz ’Ali Bassam, entered into negociations with the Japanese Cotton Trading Company for the shipment of LOGO tons of rice direct to Qetif on the mainland. Messrs aawji Jahawerchand objected on the ground that all trade for ,*atif went through Baiirain and that they had the monopoly for Bahrain. VTithout accepting this contention, the Japanese Cotton Trading Company agreed to let them take over this second shipment of 1000 tons. This shipment will come by a second J apane se st»e ame r • 3. Messrs Rawji Jahawerchand have already paid ft. 10,000/- for this rice and have agreed to pay the balance due within a week of receiving the shipping documents in Karachi. 4. it is learned that these Japanese ships are capable of carrying 6000 tons of rice or more and that they have shipments for other ports (no definite information available) in the Gulf It is unlikely that Muhammad ' arzuq will consider himself bound (even if the agreement could be held oo cover later shipments) by the agreement reached with Captain Prior in October 1932 that he would not ship direct to mainland ports,and it, therefore, seems possible that some of the cargo of these two steamers may be taken direct to Qatif in the steamers. 5. Karko Bunya requested that the ordinary port dues should be charged on rice landed in Bahrain and transit dues at 2% on that transhipped (overside delivery) for Qatif. He stated that if he had only to pay 2% transhipment charges he would ba a ole to compete at Qatif with Muhammad Marzuq should the latter import rice direct there. 6.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No: 172 dated the 10th February 1934 regarding the transhipment of a certain consignment of rice in bags weighing less than the prescribed weight for Bahrain for the Sa f udi Arab Government. 2. A copy is enclosed of a letter No: 1032/S.F dated the 11th February 1934 (26th Shawwal I3b2) from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to Muhammad Aqil Khunji giving him permission to re-export the fifteen hundred short weight bags in question. 3. I should explain that in mentioning as the proper channel 'the Saoudi Arabia Government through H.M.B’s Political Agent in Bahrain' the Adviser meant that any application should reach the Bahrain Government through the Political Agent,and did not mean that the S&amp;’udi Arab Government should necessarily address the Political Agent. 4. As both the Adviser and His Excellency ShaiJdi Hamad bin f Isa Al Khalifah have since received letters from Muhammad Tawil stating that the consignment is for the use of the ba’udi i.rab Government,! should prefer to withdraw the suggestion contained in tne fifth paragraph of my telegram No:74 dated /thethe 6 th February 1934 that an enquiry should be made through Jedda whether the consignment was actually tor the Sa'ucu Arab Government, as I thinic that to do so now might merely lean to difticulties and that,if in any future case application is not made in due form and in plenty of time,the Bahrain Government will be on firm ground should they wish to refuse permission. 5. On the 10th February 1934 His Excellency ShaiKh Hamad bin ’Isa Al Khalifah.in the course of a conversation on other matters,showed me the letter from Muhammad Tawil and said that in the circumstances he would like to let the short weight consignment go through on payment of the ordinary transit dues, to which I raised no objection. I,however,called His Excellency’s attention to the endeavour of Muhammad A^l -iiunji to act as an agent for the Sa’udi Arab Government. His Excellency said that he was only acting as a commercial agent, but I said that I bad heard that he was giving himself out as being an 'Agent' and that there was danger of such a person trying to develop himself into a Consul. His Excellency assured me that there was no question of anything of that kind taking place and I know that he himself would object to any such development. I will, however,watch the matter carefully as it is undesirable,apart from any question of consular status,that another family of the type of the Cusaibis snould be allowed to grow up in Bahrain under the aegis of His Majesty King 3m Sa T ud.

It emerges from your telegrams to the Government of India No. 47 of January 18 and No. 67 of January 25, 1933, that the Ahmedi incident was held to have involved a violation, not of the Jiluwi Agreement, hut of an agreement with Marzuk. In the former telegram you referred to your despatch No. 773S (sic in my copy, hut I think a mistake for 778S) of October 14, 1932. The despatch just mentioned describes a proposal made by Marzuk to Prior and a counter suggestion by the Bahrain Government but I cannot trace anything further in my files. Was the agreement actually concluded on the basis of the proposal and the counter-suggestion and, if so, did it ever assume written form? I presume that in any case it applied only to Marzuk and that he was the shipper of the Ahmedi cargo* It has always worried me a 'bit that, if I should again have to discuss the Ahmedi affair with the Saudi Government, which God forbid, I should not myself be clear on this point, whether or not I had any occasion to use it.

I need not enter In detail into the points taken inyour letter of 31st January, in view of the aevelopments reported in your letter of 28th February, ana I write only to say that we agree entirely with the line auopted by you in your conversation, reported in that letter, with Hafiz Wahba, which seems to us qt*r to r^rm very much the best prospect of a satisfactory outcome to this question. Our general view remains as stated in my letter to you of 3rd January, F.Z3L78/33, and if we can get the Saudis and Bahreinis to get together there ought to be some hope of a reasonable settlement. 3. As regards the points taken in paragraph 4 of your letter, we, as you know, take rather a different view from that held by the Foreign Office. But I ao not think there is any question of the Bahrein authorities 'persisting', to use your own words, ' in/“in the attitude which they have taken up in regard to British ships taking cargo direct to Saudi-Arabian ports y Our evidence is to the effect that, I whatever the merits of th e 'A hmedi’* S93r incident, its results have/been very satisfactory from the point of view of Bahrein, and, while we should not, of course, wish to say this to Hafiz Wahba, it seems unlikely, while things remain as they are, that any necessity willfarise for dealing with a further case of the same nature. 4 .

He was sorry to say that he had been unable to persuade the King to agree to an immediate conference at Bahrain. King Ibn Saud would be quite willing to send delegates to Bahrain later on, but he wished first of all to know the attitude of His Majesty s Government on the main question of direct shipments of cargo to Saudi ports by British ships. Since the 'Ahmedi' incident it had been impossible to get any British shipping line which called at Bahrain to take any cargo direct to Saudi ports. Such ships, however, frequently took cargo to various other small ports in PFO P8L SEPT.

What the King wished to know was whether it was in accordance with the policy of His Majesty’s Government that British ships calling at Bahrain should be precluded from taking cargo on to Saudi ports, or whether His Majesty’s Government had no objection to their doing so, so that he could inform the shipping companies accordingly. 2. I explained to the Sheikh that the action of the Bahrain authorities in the 'Ahmedi' case was not due to the adoption by His Majesty’s Government of any particular policy in regard to trade with Saudi Arabia, but was taken by the Bahrain authorities entirely on their own initiative and for their own reasons without consultation with His Majesty’s Government. Such questions of transit and harbour dues, etc., were within the competence of Bahrain, and it was not the policy of His Majesty’s Government normally to intervene in such questions/'in the attitude v/hich they have taken up in regard to British ships taking cargo direct to Saudi-Arabian ports'. Our evidence is to the effect that, whatever the merits of th e 'A hmedi' incident, its results have/been very satisfactory from the point of view of Bahreiquestions, which were of an internal and administrative character. Bahrain like the rest of the Persian Gulf was passing through an economic crisis, and it was natural that the Bahrain authorities should take their own measures to deal with this crisis and protect their own interests. His Majesty’s Government were convinced that agreement on such economic questions 'between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain could be reached locally without serious difficulty, since Bahrain and Saudi Arabia had many interests in common and an economic conflict between them would benefit no one. At the same time it was impossible from here to discuss the detailed economic requirements, as regards transit facilities or charges, of the two parties to the dispute* If Ibn Saud would reconsider his decision, and agree to send delegates to Bahrain, the British authorities in Bahrain would make every effort to further a settlement; and if, by any chance, in spite of this assistance and a reasonable measure of good will on both sides, a deadlock should be reached, His Majesty’s Government would be glad tocase o to ter Copies the Go copies in the attitude which they have taken up in regard to British ships taking cargo direct to Saudi-Arabian ports% Our evidence is to the effect that, whatever the merits of the H Ahmedi H incident, its results have/been very satisfactory from the point of view of Bahrei course Wahba, remain willfado whatever lay in their power to facilitate a solution* 3. I added however that, so far as I could see, it would he quite impossible for His Majesty f s Government to give a decision of principle in such a question as the 'Ahmedi' case in advance of such local discussions, since this would obviously prejudge the discussions and unduly tie the hands of the Bahraini negotiators* in any case it would be a most slow and laborious process to carry on the discussion through London, since every point would have to be referred to the authorities in the Persian Gulf. By far the most effective and expeditious means of dealing with and settling the question mould be at any rate preliminary discussion in Bahrain, as we had originally proposed. 4 # After a very long further discussion and explanation the Sheikh said that he would represent these views to Ibn Saud. We can only hope that his representations may have some effect.

My letter of the 14tn December to him, a copy of which was sent to the India Office in our official letter No. E 7258/368/25 of the 15th December, covers, I think, those points in regard to the proposed conference at Bahrain which you suggest in the first half of paragraph 4 of your letter under reply that we snould make to him. Further, since we, like you, should much prefer to avoid, if possible, any further discussion of the ’’Ahmedi” incident, we propose for the moment to wait and see whether, in view of our further explanations, the Saudi Government will INDIA OFFICE J. G. Laithwaite Esg.i ^ m 'in the attitude which they have taken up in regard to British ships taking cargo direct to Saudi-Arabian ports'^ Our evidence is to the effect that, whatever the merits of the 'Ahmedi' incident, its results have/been very satisfactory from the point of view of BahreJ course Wahba, remair . . . willfa copies if ^will change their minds and agree to a conference. 2. Meanwhile, there are one or two points in your letter which I should like to take up. So far as I can see, the present policy of the Bahraini Government in this matter is twofold: (a) they intend to levy transit dues on all cargo destined for Saudi Arabia which passes through their harbour or territorial waters, wnether such cargo is transshipped or not, and (b) they wish to ensure by means of pressure on the shipping companies that no trade goes to tne hasa coast direct but that all trade with that coast passes through Bahrain and pays these dues. 5. As regards (a), it is perfectly true, as you point out in paragraph 3 of your letter, that the Saudi Government have for the last 13 years enjoyed, at the expense of the Bahraini Government, the exceptionally low rate of the dues charged on cargo for Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, these dues have been exacted only on goods which were transshipped. We are quite prepared to agree that, so long as vessels useuse Bahraini waters for the transshipment of goods, they should pay dues on those goods. This principle does nou seem to have Been challenged by the Saudis, although the rate at which these dues were to be fixed has in the past been tne subject of dispute between his Majesty*s Government and the Sheikh; and any increase in the rate of the dues would certainly provoke complaints from the Saudi Government. But the M Ahmedi” case did not involve transshipment; it did not in fact involve any use of Bahraini waters except for the purpose of unloading cargo destined for Bahrain, and in our view the Saudis were perfectly within their rights in protesting against the action of the Bahraini Government, whether it is regarded as an attempt to impose transshipment dues where no transshipment had taken place, or as the imposition of a tax on cargo destined for Saudi Arabia which is not levied on cargo for other destinations. 4. In regard to this last point, it is the discriminatory1 $. Cv r j « s' 1 /X V v * j y^ p-* ^ discrim inator y nature of tne Bahrain transit dues which seens to me to he the fundamental weakness of the Bahraini Government’s position. I need not enlarge on this point whicu has already been fully dealt with in paragraph 7 of my letter of the 19th December to you, but I should perhaps add that we cannot, accept the argument put forward in paragraph 5 of your letter to me tnat these dues merely represent an endeavour by Bahrain to secure some recompense for its expenditure upon the harbour. If that were so, all shipping using the harbour should pay the dues and not only that which happens to be carrying cargo for Saudi Arabia. But Bahrain would of course never dream of taking this high handed line with cargo destined for Persia or Iraq. - nor would the shipping companies put up with it. 5. As regards (b) it seems to me that since the Bahraini Government are admittedly aiming at the suppression of all trade with the Hasa coast which does notnot pass through their own harbour, and since they are threatening tne shipping companies with ’’possible consequences” if they do not fall in with this policy, they can hardly be surprised if the Saudis regard this pressure on shippers as a form of economic war intended to subject the Hasa trade to such terms as Bahrain chooses to dictate and retaliate accordingly. It was in this sense that I used the term '’blockade” in my letter to you. 6. Finally, at the end of paragraph 5 of your letter you suggest that it is a mistake to treat this question as if iu were a dispute between two great powers. I need hardly say that we shall be only too glad to localise it as far as possible and we shall welcome any local arrangement that can be agreed upon between the Bahraini Government and the Saudis. But do you seriously think that we can take the line that, because the dispute is primarily one between Arabs, ordinary standards and accepted principles do not apply? And if no agreement is reached or if the SaudisSaudis prefer to take their stand on what we believe to be their legitimate grievance, will it not be to His Majesty’s Government that they will appeal, and they may very well invoke the ordinary international practice in such matters, which, as you will seen from recent and past correspondence with the Board of Trade on this question, is entirely contrary to the present policy of the Bahraini Government? It was in anticipation of an appeal of this kind from the Saudi Government that I asked you in paragraph 8 of my letter of the 19th December to let us have any arguments which you could supply in defence of the 'Ahmedi' policy. I must admit that after considering your reply to my letter, I still feel tnat our case in regard to that incident is hopelessly weak. Indeed unless the Bahrain authorities are prepared to abandon this policy which I for one should certainly find it practically impossible to defend - and enable us to say definitely thatthat the 'Ahmedi” case is not indicative of a settled policy on the part of His Majesty's Government - I fear we may find ourselves let in for a great deal of trouble. 7.

DRAFT LETTER# G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G. Offi Foreign Office, 3.W. 1. jan m My dear George, Many thanks for your letter of the 19th December, No.E.7741/368/25, about Bahrein transit dues. 2 . we read with much interest the account of your discussion with Hafiz Wahba. It seems clear that the deterrent effect of the Ahmedi incident has been quite as great as the local authorities reported at the time, ana tnat what the Sauai Government are anxious to ao is to obtain some sort of reassurance as to the future, which will make it possible for them to interest British shipping films in direct shipments to Ras Tanura. It has, I think, been fairly generally accepted that the action of the Bahrein authorities sj in the Ahmedi incident was possibly open to criticism and the ground on which they stood not very strong; and,as you say, we have been anxious so far as possible to merge uiscussion of this particular incident in a general uiscussion of the question of transit dues. We, like you, are not anxious to ventilate the incident if we can avoid doing so.most Important to do everything possible to safeguard the interests of Bahrein in this matter and we do not feel that the Saudi Government (who have for the last 13 years derived substantial advantages to which they have norclaim at the expense of Bahrein frem^the arrangement approved by H.M.G. in 1920) carn»* expect much sympathy from us if they now try to press Bahrein at a time when, as we both know, the condition of Bahreini finances is very unsatisfactory. Apart from this, in the first place, the record of tne Koweit blockade to which you refer in your letter give way lightly to Saudi representations on matters such as the present; while, in any case, all our experience of Ibn Saud islhat'^Tf^ designs, on our side encourage! him press for more. We snould in these circumstances be disposed, I think, to suggest that the line to be taken with Hafiz Wahba should be firstly that we see no profit in a discussion of the Ahmedi incident and that in the interests not only 0 f friendly relations between itn saud ana Bahrein bUt ° f PlaClng thls ve -d and intricate question of transit dues on a footing satisfactory/Draft Paper. Department. satisfactory to both parties, we have ^ consistently urged the sumnoning of a preliminary conference at Bahrein, the results of which could he confirmed through the diplomatc channel and that we have made it clear that we are prepared to give all possible assistance in connection with such a conference, at which the British Political Agent in 3 e condly, Bahrein would be present, /if he )jpresses Ibn Saud*s question as to the precise importance of the incident itself, the answer might be that the Saudi Government should not take this incident as indicative of any settled policy; that no policy has in fact been settled pending the result of tne discussions which we nave offered to arrange; but that it would be unwise to overlook the risk j , Kl 4a vU At . J !that [serious difficulties may arise from their point of view unless a friendly arrangement is entered into with Bahrein. Finally, it might perhaps be made clear to the Saudi Government thatxthe interests of Bahrein must come first and that a) far as we are concerned they need expect no asbistanco in dealing witn British shipowners in endeavours- to ship direct to Has Tanura unless 1925 5000 G.33 and/4. and until negotiations with Bahrein on the subject of the transit aues have been undertaken and have failed. a a the—resui^r-~ef^ahrelni in^ranaigeanee. 5. A slightly aggressive policy of tills nature would, 1 think, he much the most likely to bring the Saudis to reason. I do not propose in this letter to enter in detail into the arguments on the merits or otherwise of the Ahmedi incident contained in your letter. But I might perhaps say that we cannot, as at present advised, at all- accept the Foreign Office attitude in the matter, in the first place, we cannot agree that the action of the Bahrein State in any event constitutes a blockade of Sauai Arabia, it i s merely an endeavour by Bahrein to defend its own interests r 9 — ' »- 1 am s ippers are perfectly free to 1 ^ u^rUi ship direct to Has Tanura if they ^ ^ ana if they do not mind lossible consequenr^Sh^w^ Secondly, we do not think it desirable to link this question up with that of the Koweit blockade,^ t ^ ^ Bahrein and Koweit must be dealTwIttA^S^ separatelv rvn +&gt;, Ql _ v-^u. A iut-b&lt;4 Dr£ A ^ ‘ * - t. t Vl CJAAA h* “ /* d ^ separately on their merits, it i s a matter of no concern to Koweit whether the Sheikh of Bahrein secures transit dues from Ibn saud or not, and QQually/L U he had raised with me on the 16th October) our view was that the matter should be dealt with as a purely commercial proposition with the shipping companies concerned. King Ibn Saud had apparently not replied as regards the question of the proposed discussions at Bahrain; but he had explained that he was in a serious difficulty in dealing with the shipping companies in the way we had suggested owing to the attitude adopted by the Bahraini authorities in regard to ships carrying cargoes direct to Saudi Arabia and calling at Bahrain on the way. 3. The Minister then quoted a specific example, which appears to have been the 'Ahmedi T case. According to his account of it the Bahraini authorities had refused to allow the ship to discharge her Bahrain cargo at Bahrain on the ground that she was carrying, or uad carried, cargo to Saudi-Arabia direct, and the ship had therefore been obliged to take her Bahrain cargo back toto India. (This account is of course incorrect. The Bahrain cargo was in fact landed at Eas Tanura and some of it was subsequently admitted to Bahrain - see paragraph 1 of the Political Agent's confidential letter No. c/204 of the 26th November, 1932; a copy of which came to us under India Office letter No. P*Z.7846/32 of the 30th December, 1932.) Ibn Baud was much upset at this proceeding, which he regarded as quite unjustifiable, and wished to know whether it was a part of a general policy on the part of His Majesty's Government, acting through the Persian Gulf States with which they are in special relations, to prevent any direct trade with Saudi-Arabia r or whether it was to be regarded as an isolated case which would not occur again. 4. Meanwhile this incident had led to the shipping companies which Ibn Saud had approached refusing to carry any more cargo to Seudi-Arabia direct, and this was making things most difficult for Ibn Saud, who particularly wished to develop the tradeof the Persian Gulf coast of his dominions* Warner, who was present at the interview, explained that this action on the part of the Bahraini authorities had been taken because it was essential for them to protect their own interests and not allow Bahrain to he short- circuited, since they were largely dependent for their finances on the Bahrain dues* He added that this was just the kind of thing which could best be discussed locally, as it was only by local conversations by experts that the conflicting interests concerned could be reconciled. 5. I told Hafiz Wahba that I did not think that we had yet received a full report of the circumstances attending this incident, and that I agreed with Warner that it would be far best in the first place for the Saudi Government to get into direct touch with the Bahraini authorities by arranging a conference on the lines we had originally proposed. I added that, when the Minister asked to see me, I had been on the pointI point of sending him a letter in explanation of certain of the points which had arisen in the coarse of oar conversation of the 16th October, and more especially explaining oar reasons for thinking that a conference of an exploratory natare at Bahrain would be most desirable As King Ibn Saud had not specifically replied in regard to the suggested conference I proposed to send the Minister, if he saw no objection, the letter which had already been drafted on this point, (This letter has since been despatched, and a copy of it has been sent to you ander cover of oar letter No. E 7258/368/25 of the 15th December). It was eventually agreed that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should again urge King Ibn sand to agree to send a mission to Bahrain to discuss all these questions on the lines suggested in that letter. Meanwhile I promised to look further into the ’’Ahmedi incident, to which the Sheikh repeatedly emphasised that King Ibn Saud attached the greatest importance, and to let him have any information I could in due course. 6.6. you will see from the above that, although there may still be some hope that ibn Saud will accept our proposal for a conference at Bahrain, it is quite possible that he may press for a separate settlement of the ,T Ahmedi ,T case and the connected question of direct shipments to the Hasa coast, and may even make such a settlement a pre-condition of his agreeing to the conference at all. As I explained to you orally on December 15th, I have personally never been happy about this incident, in regard to which it seems to me that the action of the Bahraini authorities will be most difficult, if not impossible to defend; and it seems to me that, if this particular case is to be dealt with separately, and not, as has been proposed hitherto, considered together with other aspects of the transit dues problem at a conference at Bahrain, we must be a great deal surer of our ground than I, at any rate, feel at present. 7. So far as I can see, the drastic action taken by the Bahraini authorities against the II Ahmedi ,,the limitation of such action to ships carrying cargoes for Saudi ports in the Persian Gulf, and the general effect which the example of the ,T Ahmedi ,f has had in deterring shipping companies from making direct ship ments to those ports, amount together to something very // like a blockade of Saudi Arabia. The principle behind that action appears to be that any ship carrying cargo for Saudi ports which touches at Bahrain must pay transit duty on that cargo, whether it is transhipped or not, or be refused permission to discharge or load its Bahrain cargo at Bahrain. In the case of any ordinary civilised State such conduct would, it seems to me, be quite indefensible. It would be unthinkable, for instance, that a United States ship sailing from New York with cargo both for England and ior Germany should be made to pay transit dues at Southampton on her German cargo. Nor would Behrain ever adopt such a course in regard to ships carrying cargo irom India toto Basra or Bushira and calling at Bahrain on the way; and indeed we should have first class rows with Iraq or Persia if she tried to do so* I do. not see how we can possibly make a good defence for such action against Saudi Arabia when we should have to admit that it was indefensible against any other State. There appear to be only the following possible excuses;- (a) No other charge is made for the use of the facilities of Bahrain harbour. This would be a fair enough excuse for * imposing dues of some kind on all ships using Bahrain harbour irrespective of their cargo and even perhaps on the remaining cargo of ships which were obliged to lighten themselves at Bahrain in order to make the Saudi ports (see Marker’s comments on the 'Ahmedi 1 * case at the interdepartmental meeting of the 6th April (page 4 of the record) enclosed in your letter of the 20th May to the Foreign Office, and his letter of the 20th April to you). But I understand that it is not consideredconsidered desirable to luioose ordinary harbour dues 7 1 at Bahrain (even if there were a harbour, 1 ), the British India vessels in particular being unwilling to pay them, and that it has not yet been possible to devise any formula which would justify the imposition of such dues on all vessels with cargo for Saudi ports, but not on those with cargo for, say, ports in Iraq or Persia. As regards the necessity for lightening, the 'Ahmedi' 1 would not, in any case, have come within Marker's proviso, since she did not need to unload at Bahrain in order to be able to make Has Tanura, as was shown by her subsequently making that port without unloading. (b) A virtual blockade of the Hasa ports could perhaps be justified as a retaliation for Ibn Baud's blockade of Koweit. If this is seriously considered to be a possible line to take with Ibn Baud, surely we should have made this clear to him in advance, indeed if our justification of this action of the Bahrain Government isis really to be that it is a retaliatory measure for action taken by Ibn Saud against another State, surely the two cases should have been linked together before the action was taken. But I do not myself think it desirable to attempt to justify the Bahrain G-overnment on these lines, seeing that our whole attitude towards Ibn Saud^ blockade has been to emphasise its illegal and unwarrantable character; and I gather that you would have objections to it from your side, in any case it would be a very dangerous defence, since, if it led to Ibn Saud bringing the Koweit blockade to an end it would involve an immediate abandonment of Bahrain’s blockade of the Hasa ports also. (c) Necessity. It can, of course, be - and generally is - contended that, however indefensible her recent action may appear from the strict point of view of principle, the Bahrain Government cannot afford to lose the revenue which the present transit dues on Saudi cargoes bring'bring in. This defence has been put forward, for instance, hy the Government of India (see their v&gt;. telegram No.208 of the 23rd January, a copy of which was sent us under cover of your official letter No. P.Z. 473/33 of that date). In that telegram the Government of India took the line that in the last resort the Bahrain Government must fall back on their sovereign rights and forbid the landing of goods at Bahrain except on their own conditions. Although this is not really a Foreign Office point, it has always seemed to me that, even granted that the Bahrain Government may have the strict legal right to dis criminate in this way, since Saudi Arabia cannot claim most-favoured-nation treatment, to press this right to extremes can only damage Bahraini position still further in the end, by encouraging Ibn Saud to hasten the development of a port of his own (a not unlikely possibility now that the Standard Oil Company of California is getting busy on the Hasa Coast), and ultimately to retaliate by prohibiting vessels from usingusing it which have called or expect to call at Bahrain. 8. In any case f it has, I think, teen realised all along that it would not be at all desirable to fall back on this defiant attitude, if there were any hope of an agreed settlement. It would amount to a declaration of hostility, which would seem to me to lack any adequate justification; and, in the open conflict which would result, I think Bahrain, who would certainly be regarded as the aggressor, would stand to lose most in the long run. I have always had the gravest doubts whether such an argument would bear examination, and you will remember chat in his telegram No.l Saving of the 10th February, a copy of which was enclosed in our letter No. E 1004/^®/^ of the 22nd February to you, Ryan was particularly anxious that the V ^Ahmedi' case should be merged as far as possible in a more general discussion. X am quite willing to Relieve, or at any rate to hope, that if the 'Ahmedi' case and its dangerous implications could he dealt with in a generalgeneral review of the Bahrain-Saudi transit trade between representatives of the two States, some arrange- ment might be made which, however odd and unorthodox in Western eyes, might work locally. But if Ibn Saud refuses to fall in with our proposal for a conference and if, as seems inevitable, he persists in trying to fix the responsibility for the 'Ahmedi' policy and its consequences on His Majesty^ GrOvernnent, it seems to me that we shall have to consider very carefully what reply we are to give him. I should be grateful if you would let me have your views on this point, and I would suggest that, when you have had time to consider the matter, we might perhaps hold an interdepartmental meeting to discuss the terms of our further communica tion to the Saudi Minister. 9, I am sending copies of this letter and also of Warner^ letter No. E 6252/368/25 to you of the 24th October to Marker at the Board of Trade for his observationsIn any further communication on this subject, please quote No. c 'T.'l.S and address — not to any person by “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

A communication in the terms suggested was made to the Sauai Government on the 9th September (P.Z.6316/33). 2. On 24th October (P.Z.6832/33) the Foreign Office wrote to report an interview witn Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on the question of the transit cues* Their letter is self-explanatory. Consequent on it we asked the Political Resident to confirm that there was no foundation for the Saudi minister's allegation that Bahrein had recently raised the transit dues on goods for iSruai Arabia. This he has done in his telegram of 25th November. We are now in a position to reply to the Foreign Office (who are anxious to answer Sheikh Hafiz wuhba as early as possible) on the remaining points raised in their letter of 24th October. 3. The line taken by Mr. Rendel in his conversation seems to have been satisfactory, and this, I think, is equally the case of the general line of reply proposed in paragraph 6 of the Foreign Oiiice letter. As regards point (4) in that paragraph, it will be remembered that it was originally proposed that the Political Agent should preside over the discussions (P.Z.521/33). The Minister at Jedda doubted tne wisdom of this ana suggested that the Saudi ana Bahreini representatives should confer 'with the assistance of tne Political Agent' (P.Z.1053/33).

(E 6209 / 36 ®/ 25 ) 1933_J Uy dear Lalthwaite, As I told you. orally, the saudi-Arabian &gt;0 /PT. 1 V Minister at a recent interview with Rendel mentioned the question of Bahrain transit dues. He started by saying that the Bahrain authorities had recently raised their transit dues on goods going to Arabia, and that this was causing serious hardship to the Saudi Government t ou and I agreed in our telephone conversation that it was most unlikely that the Bahrain authorities had in fact raised the dues, since it was definitely decided in our discussions leading up to the latest communica tions made by Calvert to the Saudi Government on this subject that, though the denunciation of the 1920 Agreement should be embodied in those communications, the Bahrain Government would not immediately raise the dues since it seemed better to wait and see the e of 't COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of jtf/ o/zi £ COPY SENT DY AIR MAIL , &gt;^////i j ' / (ja ■•(&gt;.

If this was impossible, the Minister hinted that his Government would be grateful if we would urge the British shipping companies to land cargo direct on the Hasa coast. S. Hendel pointed out that the argument based on financial stringency was a two-edged one, since it was owing to the extremely difficult financial situation in Bahrain that the Bahrain authorities had been obliged to consider raising the dues. He understood that harbour facilitiesfacilities at Bahrain had been improved of late and it seemed unreasonable that shipping should continue to utilise Bahrain without paying adequately for these facili'ti 08 * 4 . as regards direct shipment to the Hasa coast b y British shipping companies, Hendel said that this was a matter for the Saudi Government to take up - if they wished to pursue it - with the shipping companies direct and that the latter would no doubt decide on purely commercial grounds whether it was worth their while to arrange calls at Hasa ports. But he doubted whether they would, in fact, be prepared to do this, and hxs impression was that under present conditions by far the most satisfactory arrangement for all concerned the shipping companies to continue to use the existing facilities at Bahrain, even if this might involve the Sill4l 00 ,—t 1 » «&gt;. «“»* • U ' MW a i +&gt; 1( ,n referred to the suggestion transit dues.

Johnstone), and in the light of further discussion with sir A. Ryan, they have now produced the further amended draft. This seems, I think, entirely satisfactory, but it would be well to show it to Colonel Fowle. If, as I imagine, he is ready to accept it, we can so inform the Foreign Office. (I attach a draft). It is, I think, really important to put Bahrein at an advantage by definitely intimating at once that they have terminated the 1928 Agreement and are now free to raise the transit dues if necessary; and you will see that Sir A.

With reference to our telephone conversation this evening, I enclose the redraft of the proposed telegram to Jedda about Bahrain transit dues, embodying in the third paragraph Ryan’s amended version of the official letter. The main points of his amendment are, as I explained, (A) that a distinction is to be drawn between the termination of the 1920 arrangement with the consequent resumption by the Bahrain Government of their liberty to raise the transit dues, and the actual raising of those transit dues* It appears to us that, in spite of the use of the word ’’notification” in Bushire telegram to the Government of India No* 526 (a copy of which came to us Lait hwaite, Esq.us under India Office letter No. P.Z. 4011/33 of the 10th July) the Political Resident’s approval in that telegram of the course of action proposed in Jedda telegram No. 133 shows that he realised this distinction. I understand, however, that in any case Colonel Fowle will he given a chance to express an opinion on the enclosed draft telegram and it is expressly stated in the draft that he has heen consulted. (ii) that, in Ryan's opinion, it is desirable to give the Saudi Government the shock involved in terminating the 1920 arrangement. The personal letter which accompanies the official note will to some extent soften the blow. As requested, I have inserted Ryan’s name in the first paragraph to show that he has also been consulted.s 4147/368/26 (l£) TKLSGRAi!

I am afraid, on looking at the redraft,that there is still a slight mliiaiderstandlng, for which 1 am, I fear, responsible. Cur idea has, I think, been that it would be well to make the statement, proposed by ftyan, that the refusal of the proposal would leave the Bahrein Government no alternative but to notify the termination of the 1920 Arrangement; but that the Bahrein Government should not in fact take any active slateps themselves such termination. The advantage of tnis would be that they would be In a better bargaining position if, as a result of Calvert's private letter, the Saudis come back to the conference Idea; while If, on the other hand, either because of the development of rias fanura or for any other reason, they are not prepared to pursue it j-urther, Bahrein could then go ahead without any r-u ^ further/ s. a. i.further eonahunloatlon wltfa-tfedda* It is, of course, arguable that the statement that 'they consider themselves free to take uny steps they may think appropriate in the matter* would leave them equally free; but, subject to your views, I think we should on the whole think the other safer, am likely to lay us less open to a charge of dlslngenuousnees or the like If It did In fact prove necesatry later for Bahrein to notify the termination of the agreement. 2. would you consider the following redraft of the penultimate paragraph of your draft? we might have a word about it by telephone when you have had time to think it over. ‘Official reply should Include statement that Saudi claim to most favoured nation treatment cannot be admitted.

A telegram in tne sense suggested on that paper was sent to Sir Andrew Ayan by the Foreign Office, No.81 on 3rd July. It appears to have crossed the Minister's telegram of 5th July, No. 133, on P.Z.3996 2. Colonel Fovvle's telegram of 7th July expressea his general agreement with the line suggested in Jedda telegram No.133, and indicated that in his view there is reason to fear that the possibility of a i port at ffes Tanura might be more than a mere bluff, i am that there was little proeatility that the Sauai Government would commit themselves on the general question of the transit dues until they knew definitely whether they could or coula not aevelop as a port. The i.-tesiaent* s views were supportea hy the Government of Inula In their telegram of 14th July, on P.Z.4166, and his express letter of 3rd July on P.Z#4458/33 gave in greater detail the information in the light of which he formed the conclusion that the threat to ueveiop has Tanura must be taken seriously. 3. On Colonel Fowle*s arrival in this country the position was uiscussed informally with him at the Foreign Office. He repeated the arguments which he had already brought forward in correspondence and said that in his view we should uo best to answer the Saudi Government for the moment on the lines proposed in Jedua telegram No. 133 of 5th July, which would enable both parties to mark time without losing face or icompromising theniselves too deeply for the four or i five months which woulu probably have to elapse before the/the position as regards Has Tanura became clear, a iurther argument in iavour ox action on ^c lines was that there was reason to believe that Ibn 3aud, as a condition of the grant oi an oil concession in Hasa to the Standard Oil, hud required them to under take to develop Has 'Ihnura. H, in fact, the Saudi authorities, either at their own expense or at that of the Oil Company, were to be able to develop Has Tanura, there would then be nothing for Bahrein but to submit. If, on the other hand, Has Tanura were to fail, or its development were likely to be a lengthy and costly business, there would be much more prospect of the Saudi Government falling into line with their views, at any rate as a temporary measure. The general sense of the meeting was with the Hesident. Owing to pressure of other work both here and at the foreign Office no action has since been taken, though the Foreign Office in the interval have discussed the question informally with Sir Hyan iince his arrival.

The holding ground in the anchorage is had and it i believed that it would not he safe for vessels over 340 feet long (British India Slow Mails are only Qi ■&gt;A'i P- I 0666 &amp;r~{li-1821)—*7-9-82—2,60,OCC. 330/-330 feet in length). Navigational aids required are estimated at two 'buoys or beacons and a flagstaff at the point. Eddies and Tide rips are apparently not a source of much danger. There is ample room for large vessels off the point in an open anchorage not worse than Debai, where steamers call regularly. (b) Ashore there are reported to be a few shops and customs officials. Tree land is offered to settlers. A lamp is put up at night. Fresh water is at present brought froma spring under the sea (such as exist in the vicinity of Bahrain) a long distance away but there are several fresh water springs at A1 Katif 20 miles South-Westward round the coast, from which Bas Tanura could be supplied, as Kuwait is from Fao. The possibility of artesian wells must not be lost sight of. (c) Work ashore is reported to be proceeding energetically, a shed approximately 130 feet by 40 feet has been built. A pier approximately 100 feet long has been constructed. At low watej the end is on dry ground but depth of sea 300 yards away is sfiid to be 6 fathoms. The Shaikh of Kuwait, who called at Bas Tanura about 19th June in his small yacht en toute for Bahrain, confirmed that there was great activity at Bas Banura but said that nothing was done while he was there. (d) In 1908 carg* transhipped into dhows at Bas Tanura/1 11 ■■ 3 Tanura was landed at Al Katif but there would now appear to he no insuperable difficulty to its being landed at Eas Tanu*a itself and distributed inland either from there or from Qatif as a base. Prima Jfacie therefore the Sa # udi Governments 3 threat to cut out Bahrain and develop Eas Tanura is serious and not a mere bluff. SB/ T.C.

I trust that the conference which has been arranged between the two local Governments concerned will result in some arrangement which will be satisfactory to all parties.

With reference to your Private and Confidential letter No. 110 of the 13th April and our reply No. 158 of the 4th ultimo I on the subject of shipments to mainland ports via Bahrein we have [ now to advise that the situation has developed and, in order to | keep you informed of the progress of events, we give you below a f summary of what has occurred. A conference between the Hedjaz Government and the Bahrein I Government has been proposed and endeavours are being made to hold ; it shortly. In the meantime the Hedjaz Government are pressing j shippers of rice to arrange for direct shipments to be taken to t Has Tanurah probably with the object in view of strengthening their position at the coming conference. The Bahrein Government are doing 11 they can to prevent shipment to mainland ports direct and our ahrein Agents inform us that, in the event of the Company arranging ifor this direct shipment, the attitude of the Bahrein Government I will be unfriendly. The Bahrein Government apparently have in view ®hat if direct shipment is made to a mainland port it will weaken Itheir case for the imposition of the 2% transit duty now in force ■and it will eventually mean that cargo for mainland ports will be phipped direct and not via Bahrein as hitherto. It is clear Itherefore that if the Hedjaz Government can arrange for a consignment p° go forward to a mainland port before the conference is held they &gt; ill be in a strong position to insist on the 2% transit duty being pbolished. The Hedjaz Government are bringing pressure to bear [ ^ Ile largest shippers of cargo destined for the Hedjaz, namelyT?lmarzook and Mr. Ali Reza, to arrange for the direct shipment E 5C 0C0 bags available from Calcutta and Rangoon for prompt ipment to Ras Tanrah and these shippers have approached us to R ran ge tonnage. They have produced letters from Ministers of Ihe Hedjaz Government demanding that, in the event of the Company P inr ^.able or unwilling to provide the necessary tonnage, the tippers should arrange for an outside steamer to lift the cargo Ind we understand Mr. Sheriff Hassam of the TSastern Steam Navigation Bom? any has offered to berth a steamer at Rs.16/- per ton. We desire, If possible, to avoid doing anything which would antagonise the Bahrein Government, but we consider that their attitude in this latter is entirely unreasonable and in our opinion if the trade for Ls Tanurah is likely to develop the Company should be ready to cater for it, particularly as it is practically certain that the cargo for mainland ports will be cargo which under the present arrangements would have been shipped by the Company 1 s Subsidiary Gulf Mail steamers to Bahrein. In any case to refuse to cater for the trade to mainland ports would not assist the Bahrein Government in any way as the cargo would still go forward by outside vessels. Although, as mentioned above, we are prepared to berth steamers for the direct trade to mainland ports, we have been unable to do so o v/lli 6 to our Nautical Advisers being definitely of the opinion that the approaches to Ras Tanruah are too dangerous unless aids to navigation are provided in the shape of two buoys. We have accordingly infortued shippers that we are meantime unable to offer them a steamer owing to the approaches to Ras Tanurah being insufficiently markeci, out indicated to them that, should the Hedjaz Government be prepared to place two buoys in ooeltLons considered by our Marine oiiperintendent be suitable, we would be prepared to send a vessel there. e k'hat in order to strengthen their case at the coming conference the Pedjaz Government will be prepared to supply the buoys in questior they already indicated their willingness to do so over a year ngo&gt; bu1 ' ^ iS i-f is possible that they have no one capaole of giving them expert[ as to the most suitaole position in which to anchor the buoys, we iiave given Bombay Agents authority to give them the services of a Company' 3 Officer in case of need and at the request of the Hed jaz [ Government. Jk As mentioned above, the attitude of the Bahrein Government is likely to become unfriendly towards the Company if a steamer is berthed for mainland ports. We do not think that the Bahrein Government is in a position to injure the Company's interests to any extent and we hone on fuller realisation of the situation they will see that the Company have scfeo ui , oe only way open to them in their capacity as transporters by sea. .e shall advise you of any further developments in this connection.

The text of tne note actually presented hy the Minister is on P• Z#3537/33. As will he seen from his telegrams of 24th Lay on P.Z.3169/33 (which have been repeated to the Government of India) the Saudis have returned an evasive and unsatisfactory reply. The question of the action to he taken in the light of their answer has been discussed informally with the Eastern Dept. 2. Neither the Foreign Office nor this Department know of any foundation for a Saudi claim to most favoured nation treatment. Equally, there is nothing to suggest that there is any real danger of the development of Pas ianura as a port in the immediate future (unless indeed the /anerican oil Interests in Hasa were to wish to develop it for their own purposes), un this point,/as will he seen, the Political Resident promises a further report. 3* The draft telegram of instructions contained in Mr. Warner* s letter of 14th June, on p.Z.3491/33, had been prepared as the result of the discussion referred to above before receipt of the ResidenVs express letter to the Government of India on P.Z.3500.

He referred in obscure language to our contention that 1920 arrangement was unilateral and terminable to which I replied that throughout prolonged discussions leading up to our proposal we had had no doubt on that point. Saudi note ignores it and also ignores proposal for conference. Iliad made out that much progress had been made with port at Fas Tanura. I said it was because further developments might affect outlook of Saudi government no less than that of Bahrain that we had suggested possibility of agreement for fixed period* Abdurrahman Qusaibi happened to call on me yesterday. Conversation turned on this subject.

Jiluwi ? s letter is one of those inexact arrangements which Arabs make among themselves with, no doubt, a lot of verbal coming and going. In practice, its meaning has been that if overside delivery from steamers to dhows is given 2 per cent of the duty may be collected., Arrangements worked until certain Rejdi merchants plotted to evade the duty, which resulted in the Ahmadi incident. Agreement still works apparently as, since the Ahmadi case, (? 5) consignments of rice and (? sugar) totalling 115,000 rupees have been transhipped from steamer to dhows at Bahrein and (' paid) 2 cent duty. Last consignment arrived April 8th.

Considerable correspondence has passed on the sud ject since last Koveniber. but at no sta^e has it been necessary to ask for orders. Matters have, however, now reached a point at which, a s the result of discussion with Colonel Powle am the interested Departments, it is possible to take a aecision as to the line to be followed. 2. The history of the question is very well set out in the memorandum by Mr. Johnstone of the i Foreign Office at flag C, The recent developments are covered by the minutes on P.Z.2129 and P.Z.2381/33 of interdepartmental meetings held at this Office on the 6th and 20th April, at the second of which Colonel Fovvle was present. In the light of discussion at the second meeting the draft telegram on P.Z.2365/53 was prepared ana the Acting Political Resident hasfcleared up a question on which there was some uncertainty, viz whether or not the 2% transit duty at present levied oy Bahrein on gooas for Hasa was, in fact, a preferential rate* 3. The draft instructions are self-explanatory. i We may, I think, regard them as generally satisfactory tut I would suggest, firstly, that we should slightly alter the second paragraph, as shown in the draft 3.0. to the Foreign Office attached, In the light of Colonel Loch* s telegram of 25th April. Secondly, as this matter is, by common consent, one of considerable urgency, and it is important that arrangements for the informal conference should be put in train as soon as possible/2 . possible, it may be well to inaicate to the Foreign Office that while we have no objection to a brief delay (say of a week or a fortnight)if the course of the negotiations between Transjordan and Nejd which are being conducted through Sir nndrew iiyan makes this uesirable, we are most anxious thcxt no considerable delay should take place, I gather that they are, in fact, prepared to make an addition to their draft in this sense. 4.

April, (S 208 iV&amp;6 8 / 25 ) 1933 My dear laithwaite, I enclose a draft of a telegram to Ryan about the Bahrein transit dues, as arranged, for your consiceration. There is one important point in it which neeas verification ana, so far as I can see, our back papers do not cover it: viz. is it true to say that the £ per cent, duty on goods for the Hasa is a preferential rate or, to put it another way, do other transhipped goods pay a higher rate? If this is confirmed, it is evidently a powerful argument for convincing not only the Saudis, but also Ryan, that the proposed alternative of raising the transit duty to a per cent, would be reasonable and would not constitute harsh treatment of the Saudis. I did ask the question at the meeting and understood Fowle to say that he thought the £ per cent, was actually a preferential rate; but the point should be confirmed. it/ I^-Iflithwaite, Ssq. INDIA OITICS.If we are barrea from using this argument, we must, I suppose, fall baok on pointing out that Bahrein in 1920 made a great sacrifice out of good will for the Saudis in reducing the rate from b per cent., from which the latter have benefitted for thirteen years.

In the first place the Board of Trade had advised that 2 ^ in the case of ships such as the 'Ahmedi' touching at S | Bahrein en route for H&amp;s&amp; and lightening themselves hy discharging cargo consigned to Bahrein hut, since no transhipment took place, paying no transit charge on the Hasa cargo in their hold, the imposition of a duty on the Hasa cargo might he defensible, though they did not much ’•avour action of this nature and would prefer in any event some phrase other than ' , tr&amp;nsit ,, dues should he used. »ho retaliatory action would in their view he justified against ships which, en route to-Hasa, either did not * *Es-ss through Bahrein territorial waters, or, while Jpssing through those waters, did not use Bahrein harbour ^4*ciii 0 i es&gt; or which engaged in overside delivery of goods ? ^tendeci for Hasa outside Bahrein territorial waters. n S 8 coMi i'. discussion with the P,&amp; 0. had sho^vn that ' Corn fany vrauld see strong objection to the institution 0 ^ .

Ryan tea now express Ms , le . 6 silica were sharea ay ore Political B9 si dent , on ae question of tactics. He recommended that the Saudi Government should be informed at the outset of our correspondence with them that the 19 2 o arrangement was regarded as unilateral and terminAhiia nr oerumable. He aavised further that it might ease matters if th° tpov n+- +- ■ L un “ t ' dSK of tne conference were expressed to be the production of a wort in- ■ u a wor ^ing agreement for a period of, say, 3 to 5 years in the f irs t pi ace; am tnat it might be preferable to say nothing in our official communication to the Saudi Government about the Bin Jiluwi and iviarzuk Agreements. inejpeeting agreed generally not to pursue further tiie Question of port dues or of tonnage discrimination, and, subject to the modification that it would be preferable to say nothin &amp; or very little about the grant of fiscal autonomy Bahrein, to approve the general line of tactics ogeoted by the minister. Colonel ffowrt mentioned in this onnection that tne precise degree cf authority of the Jiluwi Agreement was by no means clear, it was quite ' that it was merely a local arrangement entered without reference to Ibn Baud. 01 , itp. said that the next question was that , t 136 acio Pted by Bahreini representatives I • ro Posed conference, it looked at though the only ith which we could furnish them was a threat to ™Pose dues rm +hr, tt e i( tne rtasa c &amp; rgo of vessels such as the It ^ WhlCn calle d at Bahrein en route to Hasa ports. i ' 136 necessar y use this weapon with care both on National and other grounds. t,aiu Foreign Office were averse from reat. /(hiie recognising that consideration must/must be given to the interests of Bahrein it was important to avoid any action which, by prejudicing our general | relations with Ihn 3aud, might prejudicially affect matters | r of major importance such as the Transjordan negotiations. The test course seemed to he to work at the proposed conference for a friendly agreement on the lines of the Bin Jiluwi arrangements, possibly accompanied by a 'gentleman's understanding' that 'Ahmedi' cases would not I iscur, out» tnao if they aid it would be necessary for the Bahrein Government to consider retaliatory action. ; &gt; ,r l e ctnd L aithwaite . while recognising the force of the Foreign Office objections, felt strongly at tne same time tnat the chances of a satisfactory agreement woulu be much improved if it was possible to furnish tiie Bcihreini representatives with some weapon for use ii the Saudis proved intransigent. Cases of the | 'Ahmedi' type were a serious problem, and likely to become still more so in the event of the Saudis acquiring steamers oi their own, though admittedly vessels of a certain draught might evade any question of dues by calling at Has Tanura aaU ai sparging Rasa cargo there before discharging cargo ^moioiri. Moreover, while there were obvious objections lo a narked discrimination, the Hasa-Bahrein situation presented special features which had resulted in the Agreement of 1920 and which might be regarded as justifying some degree of special provision. After considerable further discussion, Mr. Rarker fesestin^, in particular, that a duty might be imposed Cargoes, possibly under the name of a 'customs htxol charge' if justifiable on the ground of preventing SHlUgpd ir» c* 44 . 6 * Appeared that all the suggestions made for cumventing evasion of Bahrein transit dues were open to the/t/li 6 object ion uithen of constituting u specific discriiriinution against Saudi goods or of imposing an undesirable tax on British shipping. Colonel Fowls set id that if it proved impossible to find satisfactory arguments with which we could arm the Bcthreini representatives in the forthcoming conference the only alternative was to allow them to deal with the question on quite general lines, and endeavour to make at the conference a friendly agreement of the most satisfactory type possible. He was not himself without hopes that when the two parties got together results would be achieved which in practice would be satisfactory, even ii tney aid not conform in all respects to western standards. The main thing was to reach some agreement, however provisional, which could be reconsidered later if difficulties arose. After further discussion Hr. Warner suggested that the Bahreini representatives might take the line at the ^onierence that they had made a very substantial concession in in lowering the transit due on goods for the Hasa xr o° i ' 0 2 %; that in existing economic conditions it Was essential Tor them to seek an increase in their ‘SVtnue; and that after careful consideration the conclusion taQ 'b e e n reached that in the circumstances it would be necessary to raise their general transit due on goods for Hasa from 2 % (which was understood to represent a P^fcrentiai rate in existing conditions) to 3 $ or above; bU't' +'Ur 4 . interests of the two States being closely they would be prepared to explore other P°sslbiiiti es of Increasing the revenue derived from the r eferentialiy treated goods destined for the Hasa, e.g.- 0 an agreement on the general lines of the Bin Jiluwi Agreement, supplemented Py a 'gentleman's agreement' in • respect of direct consignments such as that carried by the 'Ahmedi'. Some play might possibly also be made over the retention of the concession vhich had been made to Bin Saud in respect of tno passing of oaled goods unopened on payment of a charge of Hs.BO per bale. Tne meeting generally agreed tnat action on these lines seemed in all tne circumstances the most hopeful course. As regards procedure it was agreed that as a first stage the Foreign Office, in reply to sir Andrew gyan's telegram No.69 of 17tri April, should outline the general line of tactics which it was proposed to adept ana should authorise him to make the necessary approach to the Saudi Government. Copies of this telegram would be sent to the Government of ^ India and to Bushire. Formal instructions to the Political Resident would have to wait until Sir Andrew Byan's comments had been received and the reaction of the Saudi Government to his communication to them ascertained.

It seems fairly clear that avoidance of the Bahrein transit dues Is at any rate a contributing factor In the decision, cn toe other hunu, the Company presumably in certain circumstances may have to face a ae t ree of risk at Doha which will be absent at Bahrein; apart Irom wilich * if thelr expressed hope that they may om aay come to an agreement with the American interests, liich will enable them to take over the Bahrein oil concession, is realised, it may be important from tneir point of view to stand in well with the sheikh. 1 a on t know whether if these considerations were pressed on them they would be willing to modify the! arrangements? The A.P.O.C. will certainly wish to have a talk with you while you are here - if you ■iQre willing, perhaps the chance might be taken to discuss this question with them? it doesn't look irom the telegrams as though arrangements had actually yet been made.

M Mr .E.H.Marker Mr.Crombie ky r w Board of Trade, India Office, Mr.Laithwaite briefly summarised the history of this question, a detailed analysis of which was contained in Mr .Johnstone ’ s note which had been circulated by the Foreign Office. Nejd and Bahrain were to some extent mutually dependent, since Nejd needed the facilities of the port of Bahrain while Bahrain needed the revenues which it derived from the entrepot trade. It was relevant that vessels above a certain tonnage could not apparently approach certain parts of the Hasa coast without first lightening them selves at Bahrain or elsewhere, and that steamers of any sioe were unlikely to find it worth their while to carry traffic for Kasa only. As the result of pressure by H.M.G.Bahrain had in 1920 agreed to reduce the transit duty on goods consigned to Ibn Baud’s dominions and landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland to 2 per cent.and to allow free transhipment of goods so consigned direct fran steamers into lighters in Bahrain waters. Serious difficulties had now arisen in connection with the second of these two concessions as the result of efforts to-evade the payment of transit duty. In the first place/place an attempt had been made to extend the right of free transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters to goods transhipped from sailing craft. An agreement reached with Ibn Jiluwi, Ibn Saud ! s Governor of Hasa, appeared to have disposed of this, although a point to some extent left obscure in the agreement (though the answer appeared to be in the affirmative) was whether or not it covered steamers as well as sailing craft. Secondly, there appeared to be some danger of tranship- meni: outside Bahrain territorial waters. Thirdly, cases had arisen (principally that known as the 'Ahmedi 11 case) of direct shipment of goods to the mainland in vessels which, while touching at Bahrain, had neither landed nor transhipped their mainland cargo, and so claimed to evade the Bahrain transit dues. The 'Ahmedi' incident had led to formal protests from the Saudi Government and to a request for consideration of the whole position. There seemed fairly general agreement now among the interested authorities that the question could best be dealt with in the first instance by an informal conference at Bahrain between representatives of the Saudi and Bahrain Governments, with the assistance of the Political Agent, Bahrain, the results of such conference to receive ultimate confirmation through the diplomatic channel at Jedda. If this view was accepted the points for immediate consideration were the strength of the Bahrain case and the arguments which could be suggested for use by the Bahrain representatives in any such conference. ±he matter was one of seme urgency, since the India 0ff ice had just received reports that the Saudi Government had purchased a small steamer of its own Glasgow;, presumably for use in the Hasa trade. Brima fani a there seemed much to be said for aiming/aiming v**wouooion at* a ^unvention on th. general lines of the Bin JUuM ,^,e m e nt !Mta»r reaaxked that the nordi^ of the so-called Ibn Jil„ rt agreenent »as ,. rjr .r« the question of its applicability to steaters it n0t ' f0r iMta, “ e - whether it covered tranehipnent outside Bahrain territorial waters Subject, however, to the elucidation of these points, the foreign Office were disposed to re-ard on the general lines of the Ibn Jn„i agree.,* „ io principle probably the beet solution and ln general sgreement with the proposal that the ..tter should be dealt with by an inf„„,l c0nf9r9nce of the nature sijggested. Mr.Laxthwaite said that on the assumptxon that there was general agreement on these points the next question for consideration was what arguments of substance could be advanced by the Bahraini epresentatives and to what extent they could, for instance, in the event of the Saudi representatives P in c intractable, take action on the lines of the Proposal made by them at an earlier date that the ilities of the port of Bahrain should be refused hipping which engaged in transhipment or direct riage of ^oods to the mainland without payment of n^it dues. He asked Mr .Marker what the position uld be i n regard to such action from the point of VleT ' ox international practice, bearing in mind that hile Bahrain, like the other Arab States of the ^ Gult, was not a party to any international :L PPing conventions, our general policy was to ® ® cure ^ * in practice she conformed as closely as nii u * 6 1 after allowance for local conditions, to he line of such conventions.4. Mr .Marker thought that it would not be possible for the Bahrain Government to impose any restrictions on direct transhipment outside Bahrain territorial waters, or any sanctions on ships in respect of the direct carriage of goods to the mainland. -Lithwaite quoted the statement of the Financial Adviser.Bahrain, that no action could be taken if a ship went direct from India, for example, to Nejd, but that the State might impose penalties if such a vessel called at Bahrain on its way to or from the mainland. ar ^er said that in the case of a ship, such as the “Ahmedi', proceeding to Hasa via Bahrain and carrying cargo for Bahrain as well as Hasa, the prohibition of the landing at Bahrain of the Bahrain cargo was, in hie view, rather high-handed. He was, however, inclined to agree that in cases where ships would be unable to proceed direct to the mainland without lightening themselves at Bahrain or where for any other reason they used Bahrain facilities en route to the mainland, the Bahrain authorities might properly levy a small duty in order to cover expenses of upkeep of the port, etc. on that portion of the cargo which was consigned to Hasa, on the ground that it was transitting Bahrain territorial waters and enjoying the benefit of the facilities provided by the Bahrain Government. He doubted if retaliatory action could be justified where a ship proceeded direct to the mainland before calling at Bahrain. Mr .Warnreferred to the political objections any overt discrimination .against ships carrying goods for Nejd and suggested that the possibility of ohargirg port dues on all shipping might be further explored./explored. Would it be possible to deal vath the matter by requiring that all goods carried in vessels passing through Bahrain might be made to pay a small duty? Considerable further discussiai took place as to possible methods of countering the endeavours which were being made to evade the Bahrain transit duties. To the imposition of a duty on all goods passing through Bahrain there was the objection of the possible effect on cargoes for other ports in the Gulf and especially for Basra carried by the mail steamers touch!rg at Bahrain. To a proposal that the mainland duty might be charged on the whole cargo of a ship callir^ at Bahrain for the specific purpose of or in furtherance of its trade with the Hasa mainland, there was the objection that this constituted a definite discrimination against -in Saud. A suggestion by Mr .Johnstone that it might re P° Esible to discriminate in accordance with tonnage, f ' cxS reserved for further consideration. ^ It was finally agreed that the India Office should write to the Board of Trade settir^ out in detail the difficulties v/hich had arisen and asking for a rulirg k- ° ne Board as to the extent to which Bahrain, haviig regard to general international practice, was free to tar.e retaliatory action against ships which indulged in curect shipment to the Hasa coast to the injury of the port o± Bahrain and the nature and limits of such action. kr.Lait hwaite then referred to the suggestion put forward at an earlier stage by the Political Agent, Bahrain, that the State might 'repatriate' alien merchants residing in Bahrain who indulged in direct transhipment. Action on these lines had been taken (v. i on out equally substantial justification) against Bindu traders in Nejd by Ibn Baud, but the objections toit wore patent. The t , rarU Ee „ ae of the Kst ‘ «.s that action on these Unes w, undesirahl. both broad torounds and because of the danger of retaliation. Earner, pointed out that, the agents of a general nature in favour of an early and amicable settlement apart, it was definitely in the interests of Bahrain to lose no time in reaching a settlement and if need be to make some slight farther concession to Ibn Saud. The discovery of oil in Hasa might,if the field proved worth working, lead to the development of the port of Has Tanura and it might veil oe that it would pay Bahrain better to take the risk of direct shipment if she could obtain a satisfactory convention on the lines of the Bin Jiluwi agreement, rather than by standing out to risk the loss 0 f the bulk of her transit trade. further raised the question whether it was desirable in approach^ the Saudi Government regarding the proposed conference at Bahrain, to intimate that Bahrain had definitely decided that it could no longer continue the concession of free transhipment granted by it in 1920 or whether it might be^er that no threat should be made before the conference was held. The objections to giving the ‘-aidi crovernment ary excuse for complainir^ that it WaB Dei hS asked to negotiate under a threat were pointed out, and it was finally agreed that the Foreign ffice snould consult Sir Andrew Ryan on the point. x ^ e -Conclusions of the meeting were as follows:- (a) that the best prospect of advance was by sn informal conference at Bahrain, with the ^sif.tance of the Political Agent, of the nature referred to above. (b)/7. (b) that it was desirable that this conference should take place at the earliest possible date not only on general grounds, but because of the’recent purchase by the Saudig of a steamer probably for use in the Hasa traffic, and the danger that oil development m Hasa might lead to a development of the port of Has Tanura. lather, it was admittedly desirable from all points of view that a friendly agreement should be reached without delay between these two States, whose interests were to so large an extent interdependent. (c) that in the light of the considered opinion of the Board of Trade on the extent to which and the manner m which it would be possible for the Bahrain Government to retaliate against individuals indulgiig in direct transhipment, and of Sir Andrew Ryan's view on the question of the line to be taken with the Saudi Government, the whole question should be further discussed with Colonel Fowle on his arrival with a view to reaching a decision as to the line to be followed by the Bahrain representatives at the conference. (d) The Board of Trade undertook to discuss the situation generally informally with the B.I.S.N.Co., with particular reference to the possibility of the imposition of port dues.273) Draft Paper. f.Z ^ctCf^ political Department. ii DilrtjT LilTT^B. »F.A.

The State at present charges a transit aue of 2% on goods consigned/consigned to Hasa. No port charges! are levied at Bahrain and we understand that the transit uue actually charged do-Ss not in practice ftrouucf. mien —w.n the cost of providing harbour facilities,fete. at Bahrain. ihile the position is not quite clear, it appears, from the correspondence we have had, first, that cargoes for the Hasa coast are likely to he too small by themselves to fill a single vessel L in other v/ords, that the average ship will find it to its advantage to combine a shipment for Hasa with a shipment for Bahrain. Secondly, at any rate in the case of certain points on the Hasa coast, it ooeftiQ to oo thu that vessels must lighten themselves at Bahrain ii they are to make the Hasa coast. 3 ‘ Tlle steps vitoich tne state has contemplated taking to deal with the threat to its prosperity referred to above are, first, the repatriation' of alien merchants living in Bahrain who indulge in tne traffic to viiiich exception is taken; seconaly, the refusal to steamers engaging in the traffic of any facilities in Bahrain harbours ana of permission to land cargo in Bahrain ix ^ c/ cu flU'/A 1000Department. i- Bahrain is not, of course, a purty to any of the international |shipping conventions, but in '-■ccoruance with our general policy we are anxious that her practice, oo nearly as possible after . allowance for special local condit ions, shall conform to the general line oi those conventions.

I explained yesterday, the question is one of much importance to Bahrain, particularly in view of her present economic difficulties.

The QheiKh's argunrnts in favour of this step ^ere supported oy the Political resident and were consider-* ed oy th*&gt; Government of India urid His olujerty’s Government in the united Kingdom. The following Points adduced in favour of allowing cancellu* ^ 0 ^ 1932 ^ concession:- f nUt?8 ^ (i) It had been forced upon Sheikh Isa, was unilateral ind was giv^n no term. (ii) The growth of the practice of overside delivery, together with the deterioration in the finances of the State* made It impossible for Bahrein to contitiue it.'S * ^ /r K? i(ili) Although originally limit&lt;Hl to at^araprs it ntd in practice teen extended to dho’/s.

Finally the Board of Trade gave it as their opinion that the transit dues wrhich thf Sheikh desired ftyfft 10 im P oe °* in no 'vay contrary to internation.a practice or to the iDurcelona Convention. Cn the strong# or these considerations, it was thought that a reasonable case could ue mide out to the lejax-i^jd »H&gt;v^mrQOnt for th r cancellation of the second part of the concession. . Shortly before Sheikh Hamad wrote hio letter of complaint to the Political Resident, the iejas-Hejd Government had inv oked the 19 . u r-.bouyi .g the 65 / 316 / f 1932. ivm n / ja' concession in respect of a consignment of vice destined ^ ^ for qair, which had been dealt with as ordinary cargo, PV3lf/^ 6lnCr ^° stevimship company had given no prior notifies- ^1932. ^i° n °f tranahipuent. The consignment was admittedly not for I*bn Baud's personal use, out the Bahrein Government nevertheless wuiv^d payment of the duties as a friendly gesture. The most important result of this incident was....316/ 932. 316/ $321 *a8 a letter fron Abdulla blu Jlluwl, the Amir of Hatm, A to the ^ieikh of Bahrein accepting payment of the two per cent duty on the later portion of the name conaign- ment, even if it were transhipped directly into lighter*. ■Tie wording of this letter Un translation, at least; is very vague and neither the scope of the undertaking given in it nor, still less, the extent to which it can be regarded as binding on the Taudl Government are at all cl car. At all events, just when the conclusion had bem reached in London that Ibn ^aud might be in* formed that the Bahrein Government found themselves obliged to cancel the concession, it was reported from buehire that transhipment duty was being paid on large 60 consignments for Ibn naud, which were delivered overside both within and without the port limits of Bahrein. This was apparently the result of the agreement with . (Wju Bin Piluwl, and the Political fesident recoranended that CiyUitx these circumstances it might be well to leave the matter alone. Both the Foreign Office and India Office concvirred in this view. 111 • Dig LrlUah Iq-JlR company. .afld.-MaxguX, taregnenta- 4. It is perhaps worth while at this point to mention the efforts made by the Bahrein Government to prevent over* ’He delivery by arrivin’: at an agreanent with the interest •4 shipping companies.

The *nhrriPij 1 * c.if-e 8. in November. 193.0, Oth th^ reietions Of Jahrein with Ibn Saud in this matter and the direct ahiment difficulty were simultaneously called m question by the following incident. The s.s. -ahmedi*. belonging to the eastern Navigation Company of aahrein, repeated 3/316/ the voyage of the -Fagervic** and arrived at oahrein ■nth cargo for that port and for Saadi Arabia. Having refused to pay duty on the latter, the 'Ahmedl* was not allowed to land her cargo for Bahrein, whereupon she Bailed on and unloaded It at the SuUdi port of Has Tanura. The Lauui Jirector of Customs lodged a personal protest with hheilt^ Hataad and the sauli Government also protested o'flcialiy in a memorandum dated the 15 th »/3l6/ November, which ended with a request for the views of His Majesty 1 * ^ov^mnrnt on the treatment accorded to f and al«o on tv sWUi it would oe ap jro^ial o tako to avoid -uch incidente in future in genera] to settle tne question ox customs duties and transit daei between Saadi ^r *uia and Bahrein on a permanent basis. tid/Zb) The Political Resident considored that the Mar auk ^ 68/25 ^reement^ ima been broken by tho action 01 the •Ahmedi'. overnment of India did not share this vdew but agrei ^**1 tne practice of throu^r^iipnent could not ue allowtc 0 continue without serious loss to Bahrein; they considered....I /36 b/ ■ 21 }) . i«53 ji /368/ con^ld^r^a that it could only o*» pr^vent^d by the Stated forbidaing the lundlag of soous at Bahrein rxeopt on it* o*n conditions. The Political H^sid^nt had nuggested thfll th® Saudi Govern t^nt should br informed that Bahrein enjoye fiscal autonomy and Ci*n take v^iat action she pleases^ but that His M*jogty # s Government would be ^ad to lend their good offices.

It“lo really a question of whether the use of Bahrein is a sufficiently valuable ) '/A-*.-*, ^ Aa. 'u.I privilege..., CThe earlier history of the Bahrein transit aues question is given in the minute on P.2.5133/32 below. Para. 3 of that minute gives the terms of the agreement reached in 1920 consequent on representations from Bin 3 aud as to the customs ciuties to be charged on goods transitting Bahrein for the mainland of Arab ia. 2. Before examining in detail the questions raised by the Saudi note of 20th November last on P.Z.7707/32 flagged, it may perhaps be convenient, in view of the complexity of this question to indicate the various alternative methods of conveying goods from India via Bahrein to the nasa mainland ana the position in regard to the imposition of customs duties in respect thereof in each specific case. 3. The methods open are as follows:- (a) Transit goods consigned to the mainland landed at Bahrein and removed from the Bahrein Customs House for re-expoit within 20 uays from the date of landing. 2% ciuty chargeable under agreement of 1920. (h) Goods for the mainland transhipped within Bahrein territorial waters from steamers direct into lighters which proceed to the mainland without touching at Bahrein. Under the 1920 agreement no duty was chargeable. Under the arrangement made with Ton Jiluwi in June 1932 (texton P.Z.5402/32) a 2 per cent, duty may apparently be charged; (w Overside delivery ironi steamers outside Bahrein territorial waters. No duty leviable. (u; Direct shipment to mainland, no transhipment taking place at Bahrein, but ships touching there in order to deliver cargo consigned to Bahrein. It appears that steamers can only profitably undertake direct shipment to Oqair if they can lighten themselves first at Bahrein by disposing of a fairly considerable amount of cargo consigned thereto. 4. No difficulty has arisen as regards (a) above. Considerable difficulty was anticipated as regards (b) in the early part of the p res ent year. But it appears to have been met satisfactorily by the obscurely worded arrangement notified to the Sheikh of Bahrein in Ibn Jiluwi's letter of last June. 5. The State nave been very apprehensive of action under (c), particularly as they are dealing with c ommercial interests which will make the fullest use of any loophole by which they can escape the payment of transit, landing, etc. duties at Bahrein and so increase their profits. They provisionally came to the conclusion earlier this year that the only method of dealing with attempts to develop a trade of this nature would be to refuse to grant facilities to the offending firms or individuals in Bahrein.(a) raises a problem similar to (c). But the moral position of tne state is ation^er ana the abuse more difficult to justify, since the steamer, in order to maKe QQair, must first deliver a quantity ox cargo consigned to Bahrein in Bahrein. Note that no question of transhipment arises ana that action on these lines is coverea neither by the 1920 agreement nor by the agreement with Ibn Jiluwi.General Register an£&gt; Record Office of Shipping and Seamen, Tower Hill, London, E.C.3. jrhoi ,hone No. Royal 0774.

A large Quantity of this cargo has since reached Bahrain. xhe s.s. 'Ahmadi' r is reported to have returned at the Ras-Tannora from Basrah on the I4th November to -ake in 10,000 bags of dates. This cargo would normally have been shipped at Bahrain.[U^ M 1 h&amp;L* Mr. Walton, ’ I aon t think we need submit this paper at the present stage. All that is needed is an enquiry, on the lines indicated by the Foreign Office, of the Resident and 1 attach a draft for this purpose. As regards the point raised in the second half of paragraph 2 of Mr. Renders letter, I think the Resident s despatch of 30th November on P.Z.7846/32 makes it clear that the action of the Bahrein authorities was designed simply to bring pressure to bear on the shipowners concerned. From the point of view of international comity it was probably rather high-handed, but the correspondence makes it clear that the State are dealing with commercial interests which will not hesitate to take the fullest advantage of any loophole, and there is probably substantial justification in practice for the action taken by the Sheikn. But on this also we might ask for the Resident’s observations. When/When we receive a reply there is no reason why we should not have an interdepartmental meeting, and copies of the correspondence can in the me®time, as suggested hy the Foreign Office, go to the Board of Trade.

With reference to correspondence ending with telegram Ho. 208 (Ho. 40 to the Government of India), dated 19th Hovember 1932, from His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, to His Majesty's Secretary of state for foreign Affairs, I have the honour to submit the following report on the recent visit of the British steamship 'Ahmedi' to Bahrain and the circumstances which resulted in its discharging its cargo on the mainland of Arabia. 2 » On the 25th October last, Captain Prior, the ^Political Agent, Bahrain, who had visited Bushire to confer with me on various matters, received a telegram from the Financial Adviser, Bahrain state, that the shaikh of Bahrain issued a proclamation on the 24th uctoOer forbidding any Person to accept the local agency of Shipping Sompanies with- the previous permission of the State; that the steamship 'Ahmedi' was due on 27th October with 4U0U packages for Strain and 7000 for Ojair, on the mainland of Arabia, and the State refused permission for any cargo to oe landed at Bahrain from the vessel.V - 2 - After conoulting me.

The 'Ahmed!“ duly arri^d on 8 7th October, am •n learning the attitude of the toirain «overrm*„t the captain of the vessel applied to the Political Agent, Bail rain, for assistance, representing that the Bahrain oov- ernment had no concern with the cargo consigned to Ojair, the duty on which was payable by the consignees. Captain mor, however, pointed out to «a me that the consignee., or their agents, of the cargo consigned to ojair lived at Bahrain. The matter was urgent* there was no time to enter into lengthy arguments, especially by telegram, into the 1 * w o&amp;tc b aecision, and the main object for the aeaent was to enable the 'Ahmedi* to discharge her cargo for Bahrain with Hie least possible delay, and continue her °yage. i suggested, therefore, as a compromise that the Bahrain Cfovernmemt should permit the cargo for Bahrain to be dig charged if the consignees of the cargo for Ojair gave the •tale a letter guarantee to pay the 2 per cent, charges, the understanding that the matter would be put to the a*l&gt;icraoion of the Political Agent later. This suggestion coaanunicatid by Captain Prior to the Bahrain oovernment °n the 29th October the financial Adviser, Bahrain State, inf* med Captain i?rior that the Bahrain Oovemmeat had informed °aptain oi the 'Ahmedi* that it would permit the discharge the cargo consigned to Bahrain provided the 2 per cent. charge/- 3 - charge on the cargo consigned to ojair wae lodged in the Baetem Bank, Bahrain, provisionally in the mane or the Political Agent, the captain of the vessel to act as agentLf the line, using toe Bahrain handing Coapany (a subsidiary of the British India Company) for discharging the cargo for Bahrain. This latter proviso «as presumably in order t toe letter of their proclamation of 24th October might be carried out. Captain ftrior then left for Bahrain, and on his arrival there informed me that toe -Ahmedi- had left Bahrain before his arrival without dis%arging any cargo, * which it carried to Has Tanura, on the mainland, and dis charged there. On the let November I telegraifoed tg the JPblitical AW t* Bah ain, that the Bahrain Ooverntatnt should not wi m- °ut Prior reference to me issue a notification refusing steamers, which carry cargo to the mainland, permission to discharge cargo at Bahrain. The case of the “Ahaedi* 1 was an isolated one and the compromise suggested by me (Tide paragraph 5 abo^e) was in order to avoid delay to the steamer without binding the State in any way. The Bahrain Government proclamation of 24th October (a summary of tohlch is given in paragraph 7 of letter Bo. C73/3, dated 31st Cctober 1932, from the Tinancial Adviser, Bahrain, copy e^ciooedj did not in itself offer ground for protest by either •kipping interests or the aaudi Arab Government. A general notification, however, on the lines of the first sentence of this paragraph might, in ay opinion, have furnished ground *°r protest, and this I was anxious to prevent. Since drafting the above I have received a letter f rom the Bolitical Agent, Bahrain,—Mo. C/204, dated 26th November 1932,—a copy of which I encloae, reporting the ■ethod oi diepoeal of the Bahrain cargo landed at Has Tanura. 8 ./8. 3uotl are trie ^ttoxs connected witn tne recent visit of the -Ahmed!- to Bahrain.

TO, ; ine iion f ole the Political Resident m the Persian Cull*. ,Bushire. Sir, In continuation of ny letter No:C/l75 aated the 15th November 1932 I ha.ve the honour to say that the aifair of the C.S ’’Ahiaedi' appears to have settled itself. Upon the refusal of the Bahrain Government to allow it to discharge Bahrain cargo in Bahrain,it took this cargo to Has Tanoura,whence it was either taken to atif or stored at Pas Tanoura. Fuhararaad al Tawwil,the Director of Customs for the Rasa ports,gave every facility for this and maue no charge whatever on goods that were landed, the idea being, of course, to encourage such shipments in the future. Some of the merchants concerned disposed of tneir Baurain cargo on the Mainland and others brought it to Bahrain,where they were allowed to bring it in as a special case on payment of the ordinary Cus toms dues. 2. The action of the State appears to have had an excellent effect. The idea appeared to have got abroad that the Bahrain Government were powerless to retaliate against anyone who injured tneir trade or to take steps to defend themselves. As a result of their resolute action,however,it appears that all idea has been given up of sending such shipments in future and,Abdul Aziz al Bassam,the Bahrain agent of Muhammad al tfarzuk of arachi,has apparently been authorised to arrange fortranshipment in Bahrain waters upon payment of the KE duty of 2/c in future. Tiiis, of course, arises out ol the negotiations set on foot a month ago ana,if,as appears, Muhammad al Marzuk has decided to give up his attempts to evade the Bahrain dues the matter has achieved a most fortunate conclusion. 3. IJie action of these shippers in sending cargo direct to Neja waters was very strongly resented by the whole body of public opinion in Bahrain, fne bulk of the merchants realised quite clearly that the growth of the Mainland port would cause them great difficulties and they were insistent in their demands that the Bahrain Government should do something to protect them. The Bahrain Government in addition,! believe,are reducing their khanchiya arid other charges to facilitate the re-export of cargo and rentier any further attempts at direct shipment unlikely. I have the honour to be Sir, Your iloat Obedient Servant, G.G.Prior.

Wamer's ctter of 12th October on p.z.6233, were proposing to °tixy to Ion 3aud the discontinuance of the concession ft O f-v a decision taken in the plenitude of the rights'of th q -r . . * e Sheikh of Bahrein in preference to consulting him to one adrogation of tne arrangement . Hatters were at this stage changed hy °fonel Fowle*s telegram of the 7th October (P.2.6092/ w -kich suggested that the difficulty had been overcome/overcome ana recommended that in the circumstances no communication shoula be made to the Hejaz Government unless ana until that Government reverted to the question. His views were supported by the Government of India. The matter has teen discussed informally between Mr. Jlauson ana the foreign Office. As you wlU see fr om his note of 20 th October below, the foreign oil ice do not think that there is anything to lost by accepting the Resident’s suggestion. If it turns out tnat this is merely a temporary improvement^ delay of two or three months will not materially -fleet the situation. If, on the other hand, the °^ouai Government continue to pay dues on goods transhipped for the next few months and the question therefore drops, so much the better. ^ 4 Mr. Clauson's note refers to a minor but ^portant point. The Resident in his despatch of 20th os P^ember had referred to the possibility of retaliatory measures/edSUres against ^iPPing which declined to fan m with the wishes of the Bahrein state as regards overside transhipment, the two specific suggestions ^ 6 beinb tne rlght 10 rer use penriission to such vessels to call at Bahrein ana the possibility of 'repatriating- merchants who conducted their business on oojectionable lines. The Resident was anxious to go slow on both points ana to make a recorrmenaation on either only after further consideration. Clearly both ' V ° UlCl ral ° e 11I ' portant general questions, and the Foreign ^ lice suggestion that, in the event of our desiring at “■ny l a ter stage to support them the opinion of the Soars ox iraae shoula first be obtained, is clearly re&amp;conaole. we may, however, hope that the u. ix i'icnii'iio s lri to transhipment at Bahrein have now 0ee n overcome. 2S . aver # % brt (E 4829/316/S5) Foreign oppick, s.w.x. ^• 12th Ootoher, 1932. &lt;3 3 it My dear Laithwaite, You are, I thunk^waiting' to learn our views on your official letter P*Z*5133/32 of the 19th September to the Colonial Office about the proposed annulment of the concession made by the Sheikh of Bahrein to Ihn Saud in 1920, exempting from transit dues goods which are destined for Ibn SaudYs dominions and are transshipped at Bahrein direct from the steamer into lighters or dhows without being landed. V. r e see from the semi-official correspondence between you and Jenkins of the Board of Trade that the possiole ,, international ,, difficulty under the Barcelona Convention is disposed of. After careful consideration °f the arguments advanced by Biscoe in his despatch of ^une 29th, of which you sent us a copy in your letter P *Z. 4032/32 of the 8th July, and by the Government of india in their telegram of the 23rd July (your letter p *2.4453/32 of 25th July), we are prepared to acquiesce in/r in the proposal that the Sheikh should now he allowed to withdraw the concession# l '/e have, however, two points to raise. We think tnat it would he inappropriate to a sk Ihn Saud to agree to the discontinuance of the privilege, as suggested in para graph 9 of Biscoe T s despatch, since this would imply that we were not confident of our position and felt hound to ask ion Baud’s consent# If such consent were refused the siuuation might become embarrassing# We would therefore prefer to notify to Ihn Saud the discontinuance of the con cession as a decision taken in the plenitude of the rights of the Sheikh of Bahrein; and we think it would prohahly he preferable not to mention the alternative of imposing port dues. The withdrawal of the concession and the proposed e xplanations will imply, to some extent at least, a confir mation of the remainder of the arrangement made in 1920: that is to say that they will imply that the dues to he charged henceforward on all goods in transit at Bahrein and destined for Ihn Saud’s dominions (except those for Ihn Saud’s personal requirements) shall remain at two per cent# 1 understood, when I raised this point with you the other day/.(0 day, that it would, in the opinion of the India Office, he met by instructing the Political Pesident not to permit the Sheikh to raise this transit due above two per cent, and that you were confident that the condition which is being made in agreeing temporarily to grant the Sheikh tariff autonomy - viz. that he must give the Political Resident four months’ notice of any proposed change in his tariff - will place the Political Resident in a position to carry such instructions* he should be glad to have confir mation of this and to know that you are prepared to instruct Fowle accordingly. On hearing from you that you agree, we will instruct Hope Gill to make a written communication to the Saudi Government on the lines proposed above* I am sending copies of this letter to Blaxter an d to Jenkins* Yours ever,iC -1 ro/DH.

Sir, X have the honour to refer to Ooveraiaent of India telegraa ho. 1644 of the 23rd July 1938 to the India office and connected correspondence on the above subject* 2# Whether the Bahrain State can abrogate the Transit )ues Agreement nlth His Majtsty Ibn saud seems to depend on vhether the so-called agreement was really an “agreement* or ■erely a ^concession“• In ordinary law for a contract, or agreement, to be binding there muot be a “consideration* given or received on both sides and it is arguable that the same holds good in international lav. The Bahrain state certainly received no consideration frai Ibn baud in the •atter: on the contrary the State has been the loser* It senoB obvious therefore that the arrangement come to nas a c °nceB8ion on the part of the state which it can with- local circumstances having altered* If this view is correct would Hitfnot be poeelble for the communication to 1118 **jesty ifcn 3aud to be of a moro categorical nature than/than that outlined in paragraph 9 of Sir Hugn Biscoe'a letter Bp* 43S-8* dated the 19th June 1932, to the India 3 of their telegram under reference? If the agreement in question was in reality no “agreement*, but merely a con cession, could not Ibn Saud be Informed that, owing to changed circumstances, which of course would be carefully explained, the halrain state regretted that they could no longer continue it, and that in future 2 per cent, dues will be charged on goods delivered overside? There would thus be no question of ibn baud’s refusal, and—* provided that the Bahrain State has a right to levy these dues (which it would seem to have according to the Board of Trade letter ho. C.M.T.474V32* dated the 16th August 1932, copy forwarded to the Government of ^ndia and bush ire under India uffice printed letter * 0 . iV a. 4991/ 32, dated 20th August 1932)-r-t;here will be no question of ths State having to impose port dues, the objections against which are detailed in paragraph 9 of sir Hugh Bitcoe’s •JLlMtWT already quoted, Ibn »aud will aoubtlean be dis gruntled, but natters hare now reached a paae where It seems to ms ws have to dboose between offending His Majesty, and staving off) ruin for Bahrain. The financial I condition of the latter is already, without any question j of the loss of transit duts # causing me no little anxiety. ?he state depends for its prosperity almost entirely on the pearl trade, which at present is at a very low ebb: catches of the last few seasons have been poor, and even when pearls are found there is little market for them, nor is the market likely to improve for some years. The State gets by far the greater part of its revenue froFi ad valorem customs dues, and not only has the bulk of trade decreased, but likewise the price of conmodities imported. hast/Last ytar’* budget # (the Bahrain financial year rune frost May to April) received since air Hugh Biscoe wrote his despatch of 29th June* did not balance, and unless an un expected change for the better occurs the Btate will very soon be reduced to the dangerous expedient of living on its capital—a small reserve which it has built up in more prosperous times* If to this critical state of affairs is added the loss of its transit dues the atate will be brought an appreciable step nearer to bankruptcy, and His majesty^ Government or the Government of India may well—as pointed out by Sir Hugh Biscoe in paragraph 8 of hie letter already quoted—be forced to ooxae to its financial assistance as they have already had to do in the case of Muscat. So much with regard to the Ibn baud aspect of the question, as will be seen, however, from the copy of a letter dated 1st September 1932 from the British India Steam Mavi- gation Company, Bombay, which I enclose, there has now arisen another and perhaps even more serious complication. On receipt of this letter I telegraphed the Political Agent, Bahrain, now on reoess in Karachi, to get into touch with the British India Company’s Agent there, who would doubtless be au fait with the matter, talk it over with him, and let me have both their views. I enclose a copy of Captain Prior’s *«Ply. 4 » The situation is that the British lHHi Company, faced by competitors who threaten to practice overside delivery outside Bahrain waters, state that they will reluctant iy be compelled to adopt the same practice themselves unless 1 oan produce any sound and cogent reasons why they should not do so. The Company do not fear the competition of nati *o craft (vide paragraph 3 of Captain Prior’s letter, aspect is also dealt with in paragraph 5 of air Hugh Siscoe’s depahtoh of 29th Juno): it is the competition repre-•anted toy »uoh Tessa la u a. 8. «JagemoJt«—Mentioned by Captain fTior—afaioh ie the danger. 5.

With reference to this danger Captain Prior suggests the possibility of the utate refus ing such foreign steamers permission to come into Bahrain waters, or at any rats to unload cargo there. As there is not enough cargo for the mainland only to fill a steamer, such vessels would be compelled to call at Bahrain to unload the balance of their cargo, and they would not be allowed to do thie by the State if they had practised overside delivery outside Bahrain waters. (At least that 1® how I understand Captain Prior 1 * argument.). It seems 10 »« that such action might be successful in removing the competition of overside delivery outside Bahrain waters, *toich is the main danger driving the British India Company towards adopting such measures themselves. Captain Prior Points out that the State refused Bueslan vessels pt mission/pcrnisaion to call at Bahrain, and presumably they nave equal right to extend this refueal to other vesaeia, / retaliation in the way of shipping reatrictione bein^-, I believe, a legitimate weapon in the hands of any Govern ment. Such vessels might not always be foreign ones: a steamer belonging to an Indian Company might also be chartered, but—though this might raise protests in Indian circles—I think the Bahrain state would be on strong ground in applying the restriotion to Indian vessels also. The restriction, it must be remembered, would not be an absolute ana. it would ne rely be? a measure of self •protect! on Any vessel that did not practice overside delivery outside Bahrain waters would be welcome at Bahrain. Captain Prior*8 further suggestion of ths possibility of the •repatriation'* —a euphemism for sxphlsion— of merchants who conducted their busineufc on objectionable lints (paragraph 2 of his letter) I cannot fully endorse* Bahraini merchants the -Hax.rain Government could presumably deal with as they thought expedient, though even they might find it difficult to punish their subjects for practising lawful trade, how ever much this trade might run counter to the financial interests of the Utate. But it is more than likely that some of the Offenders* would be cither foreigners or Jnciane, both of whom by the Bahrain order in Council come under the jurisdiction of ths Political Agent, who cam deport them only for certain epeelf led offences • In other words, it would be legitimate to take action against the trading, but not against the persons of the traders. 7 * With regard to the letter from the British India Company referred to above, I enclose a copy of my reply, *foioh is to the effeet that I trust that they may be able to ***it and see* before taking ths steps they contemplate. 1 understand their amxiety not to lose trade, especially in these/ V othess i,uj. i me a for ahipplng conpanlra, but it is inport* ant that they should be dissuaded-—if poseibis—fmi talcing any precipitate action, once they comnence over side delivery an impetus *111 be given to this undesirable practice *iieh it may be very difficult to stop. It to equally necedsary/far the Bahrain atate, and ourselves, to consider the matter of overside delivery outside Bahrain water© carefully before committing our selves to definite steps for putting an end to this practice, lending, there fore, a consultation with Captain Prior, «ho arrives here on the 12th ueteber, (1 will also obtain the views of the financial Adviser, Bahrain,), I should 11 ice ay views ex pressed in paragraph 6 above, on Captain Prior's suggestion as to retaliatory measures, to be considered as tentative. I have, however, given them now ao that the aatter might coiae under the consideration of hie Majesty's ooveraaent as soon as possible# On the other hand my views expressed in paragraph 2 as to the nature of the communication to be addressed to hie Majesty Ibn Baud, provided that the atate has the ri*£rt to Impose the 2 per cent, dues on overside delivery within Bahrain waters without having recourse to Port dues, may be taken as considered ones* ¥ o yhe Bahrain atate is faced with serious financial difficulties, and if to these is added the loss of its transit dues, in order to stave off the bankruptcy of the atate, hie Majesty's covermaent of the inoian Government may sooner or later have to step in and assist the atate as they did in the case of Muscat. By a concession which the atate, some twelve years ago, under ; siderable pressure from us, gave his Majssty Ibn baud, ** is now threatened with the loss of these dues. X am of opinion that His Majesty should be informed that, owing to changed circumstancee, the atate is now regretfully eom- pe lied/eompellsd to cancel this concession• a further com plica* tion* however, has now arisen. The British India Company, forced by competitors idxo threaten overside delivery out side Bahrain waters, state that they will reluctantly be compelled to adopt the same practice themselves unless strong reasons oan be produced why they should not do so. Certain action to deal with the threatened competition has been suggested by the t^litical Agent, Bahrain. in as far as his proposals are directed against the methods of trade, and not against the persons of the traders, these proposals have my tentative concurrence. With regard to the letter from the British India Company, I have sent them a reply which I trust will have the effect of prevent ing them from taking precipitate action until I have had an opportunity to consult further the iPolitical Agent, Bahrain, #10 is visiting Bus hire shortly, and until His Majesty’s Government have had time to give the matter their consideration.

The issues, however, are fortunately fairly simple. The position is briefly that the Sheikh of Bahrein under his treaty with us/is precluded from Gharging^ a auty of more than 5% on goods imported into Bahrein by British subjects. Up to 1913 the oheikh charged 5% on all cargo, but in that year he reaucea it to on cargo destined for the mainland but transitting Bahrein. In 1916, on the ground that the effect of the War had been greatly to reduce his customs revenue, he again increased the charge to 5%. f i This produced a protest by Bin Baud, who demanded the remission of all dues except Arttoyah or ground tax (in 1920 about 2i%) charged on all goods lying in the customs warehouses. Bin Saud’s request was discussed between the Government of India, the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia (sir A.T. Wilson) and Colonel Dickson, then Political Agent, Bahrein. The general feeling was, firstly, that international practice, so far as it could be regarded as stable, justified the grant of special treatment for goods which were merely transitting a country. Apart from this the Government of India had in view the interests of Bahrein itself since they feared that Sheikh Isa's insistence on excessive transit dues would kill transit trade, whereas smaller charges would increase his income. In these circumstances, after considerable discussion and greatly against the willof the Sheikh, Sheikh Isa was obliged to agree (a) to charge 2% duty only on transit goods consigned to the mainland, provided that these were removed from the Bahrein customs house within 20 days from the date of landing (Note that 2% was, in fact, a rather more favourable rate to Bin Saud than might have been imposed. Compare on this para.5 of Captain Prior's letter No.C.104 of 26th June 1932 on P.Z.4032/32). (b) that if goods for the mainland were transhipped from steamers direct into lighters which proceeded to the mainland without touching at Bahrein no duty would be charged. 4 No difficulty has arisen over concession (a) and no modification of it is now contemplated. f 4 Concession (b), as will be seen, applies specifically and solely to goods transhipped from steamers direct into lighters. The State authorities not appear fully to have appreciated this fact, possibly to some extent because practically no .advantage has been taken of the concession up to quite recently, and they have accordingly been permitting the transhipment free of any duty of goods from native craft into lighters or other native craft The situation has become somewhat acute partly because of this misunderstanding, because a very considerable development of shipment in native craft took place during the spring of this year (compare page 4 of Sheikh Hamad’s undated letter (June 1932; to Sir Hugh Biscoe, on P.4032732)^ In these circumstances the Bahrein Government press for a revision of the arrangement of 1920 and ask to be allowed to apply a customs duty of 2% to all goods directly transhipped from boat to boat within their boundaries. The/ Jinute * &lt;5jinute Paper. Department | £. The request of the Bahrein state is supported hy the Political Agent, the Political ; Resident and the Government of India. The broad arguments in favour of some concession to them are, firstly, those contained in the Goverment of India's telegram of 23rd July; secondly, the fact that this concession was granted at a time when Bahrein not only afforded no special port facilities such as sne has now developed, hut when, as stated by Sheikh Hamad in his unaated letter of last June, 'it was not the custom to transfer cargo from one boat to another in the water within the boundaries of Bahrein', a j state of affairs which has now entirely changed. Finally, there is the strong argument that the 1 inancial position of Bahrein is such that some | alleviation such as is contemplated is desirable on merits, and that in any case it is inequitable that an arrangement of this nature should run in perpetuity, without one of the parties principally concerned having any liberty to consider modification | of it. 7. The case for a modification is a strong one from the point of view of Bahrein. But we must ; now consider its probable reaction on Ibn Baud. Ibn Saud undoubtedly had reason to be grateful to H.M.G. for the concession of 1920, which was one of great (a*. I«4« ) ^ generosity. There was, however, in favour of a concession of the general character of that then frontomplated^ the international practice in regard to transit/ )transit duties. It is not now proposed in any way to alter tde special concession rate charged on goods for Ibn Saud’transit ting Bahrein, and all that is proposed is a modification of the arrangement under which goods destined for the mainland and transitting Bahrein may use Bahrein port facilities and he transhipped in Bahrein waters without any financial advantage to the Ruler of Bahrein. g. The position is to some extent eased by the fact that transhipment is (not unnaturally) extremely unpopular with the British India Company (who find it a cumbrous and difficult procedure), the Hindu merchants of Bahrein and the local inhabitants, who benefit by landing fees. Consequent on representations both by the State authorities and by the local Hindu merchants, Captain Prior took the matter up at Karachi in the course of last year, when he found that the British India Company had already decided to accept no furthercargo for overside delivery, with a view to securing that they should ^ ^ (£&gt; dxc/Liu** j not lose trade to small country craft sailing direct to the mainland and cutting out Bahrein, Captain Prior arranged with the State for the abolition of an extra * Khanchtyah, or demurrage charge, which had been Imposed by it in 1931 and the effect of which was to add 14 -% to the Bahrein dues. Considerable discussion \| has taken place as to whether or not this arrangement is not a breach of the 1920 agreement with Bin Saud. The Charge d*Affaires at Jedda, while inclined to think that no breach was involved, urged that we should avoid giving Bin Saud grounds for legitimate complaint. The Minister at Jedda is still of opinion that no clear breach is involved, though in his private/ ^1inute Pap® 1 ** Department. private letter of 14th June on P.Z.4514/32 to the ^ Foreign Office, he sets out the arguments for ■ recon side ring the arrangement -arguments, it may Pe ; remarked, now to some extent otsolete, in view of the opinion expressed by the Government of India in their telegram of 23rd July on P.Z.4453/32. Sir Hugh BioCoe s recommendation was that the position should i be explained to the Hedjaz Government and that they should be asked in the changed circumstances to agree to the Bahrein Government’s proposal, a warning being .given them that the only alternative to the abolition O-l hie ri e ht of iree transhipment was the levy of port cues, which Bahrein were clearly entitled to Impose if | they thought fit and which would, in the long run, probably involve higher freight rates from Bombay, which would be in the interests neither of the !Hedjaz Government nor of the people of Nejd. Those port dues, incidentally, would be very unsatisfactory from the standpoint of the B.I. etc. I gather that both the Colonial Office and ! 'the Foreign Office are orima facie much impressed by the arguments for meeting Bahrein contained in Sir :Hugh Biscoe’s despatch and, in particular, in the iGovernment of India's telegram. The case is, I think, on merits a very good one and I submit that we may support the recommendations of the late Resident and the Government of India. The Question of how best to !put the point to Bin Saud will form the subject of jinfonnal discussion with the Foreign Office and the ^Colonial Office when an official expression of our jviews has been conveyed to those Departments. Prima ^ucie the course suggested in paragraph 9 of Sir Hugh Biscoe's/ 401)0 3 30-^r^rr Biscoe's despatch No. 436-3 o£ 29th June, on P.Z.4032, seems a sound one and it will he seen that the Government of India agree in this view. 10. Draft letter to the Colonial Office (copy to Foreign Office) is attached. J.G• LalTHWAlTE. 3.8.32. After the above minute had been prepared the Foreign Office raised the question whether the transit cues at present levied by the Sheikh were in fact admissible having regard to the terms of the Barcelona Convention and general international practice. The natter was taken up with the Board of Trade in the d.o of 8th August on P.Z.5426/32, which is, it is thought, self-explanatory. The Board of Trade replied reassuringly (their letter of 16th August on P.Z.4991/32) and the final views of the Foreign Office aru contained in their letter of 23rd August on P.Z.5133/32. The Foreign Office acquiescence is rather grudging, but I think that all things considered we may take it as a withdrawal of their objections and proceed on the assumption that the transit dues may be regarded as corresponding to the amounts necessary to defray expenses to which the State is put by the supervision and administration arrangements entailed by the transit facilities which it provides. c.

I am to say in the first place that, in the light of the^J^*^/ : correspondence noted in the margin, [ copies of which have already been sent to the Colonial Office, the Secretary of State sees no difficulty on international grounds in regard to the dues at present levied by the Sheikh.^^ 3 # The general question is admittedly not free from difficulty, having regard to the terms of the concession granted to Ibn Saud in 1920 and it is clearly important in any negotiations with tne Hedja^ Government which may result xrom 4000 5.32 investigation of the proposals of the Sheikh of Bahrein ( to avoid any ch erg e 1 ! ft m ■ fi 3i -mm* charge of ill faith. Sir Samuel at the same time feclo that- t the arguments adduced in Sir Hugh Biscoe*s Despatch of 29th June and the Government of Indian telegram of 23rd July, to which reference is made above, carry v-e*y great weight more particularly in the difficult financial conditions at present confronting the State of Bahrein. 4 The question has already been « , very closely examined in the corres pondence referred to above; the t arguments on both sides have been throughly canvassed, and it is not proposed to recapitulate them in any detail, Suffice it to say that in ) the light of the discussion the Secretary of State finds himself in complete agreement with the views of Sir Hugh Biscoe and of the Government of India and agjpeeB'~WTt‘?!-thren that we must acquiesce in the withdrawal by the Sheikh of the concession of free transhipment, explaining the s position to Ibn Saud on the lines suggested in paragraph 9 of Sir Hugh Biscoe’s Despatch of 29th June. He agrees also that in the event of its proving impossible to satisfy the King of the Hedjaz and Hejd by an explanation of this nature, it would be necessary, despiteDepartment. despite the objections to such action, to consider without further delay the imposition of port dues by the Sheikh of Bahrein^ But his ’ strong feeling, which will he ^rus oS oe shared by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, is that i J both 0 n grounds of equity and on * wider political grounds, the right solution of this question is the modification of the arrangements of 1920 so far as they refer to transhipment free of charge. It is relevant in this connection that, in the first place, the arrangement of 1920 did not extend to any cargo save that transhipped from steamers into lighters or native craftjthat until quite recently no advantage!, for practical purposes, appears to have been taken of them-, and that the effect of with drawal would not so fsr as can be judged be of substantial importance to the Government of the Hejaz and h T ejd. In the second place, while it would no doubt be possible to bring some pressure to bear upon the British India Company with a view to their reconsidering their reluctanceto accept cargo for transhipment — at Bahrein, the case for such pressure is not a strong one , and Vb«^(^n^any everr^ there &lt;is ^ considerable risk that action of this nature might lead to criticism in the Indian legislative bodies as the result of from the Hindu merchants of Bahrein. 5.

The first point may be open to doubt, but in view of the fact that it is usually in our interest to interpret the Transit Convention as widely as possible we should not wish to contest the Foreign Office view, which apparently is that goods transhipped at Bahrein are in transit within the meaning of the Convention. The real point is the second one, that is whether these dues are ’’special dues in respect of transit” within the meaning of the opening words of Article III of the '^aithwaite, Esq.quite confident that the answer is in the negative. The Transit Convention is intended to secure that a country shall not place impediments in the way of goods which have to cross its territories in getting from one country to another. The dues which are allowed to be levied are those ”intended solely to defray expenses of supervision and administration entailed by such transit', This, as you will see, makes no mention of such expenses as the upkeep of ports. It was intended to deal solely with the provision of services for the purpose/5 of securing that goods^ which had paid no customs duties because they were in transit^actually left the country at the other end of the journey and did not remain within the country itself. Clearly, therefore, it was contemplated that dues necessary for the upkeep of ports and similar expenses would be charged in addition. As we understand the matter, this transhipment charged is intended to defray the expenses of the port. JUo countrj can claim that its goods shall have the use of a port in another country and shall make no contribution to the /ofof that port, and it soeins to us therefor© that no country can claim that goods which have to be imported through Bahrein should escape all charges in Bahrein. tfor the reasons which you explained it would be inequitable and unsatisfactory to charge port dues on the tonnage of the vessels carrying the goods, as is done in most other countries. The alternative is to charge dues upon the goods themselves, and it seems to us that dues so charged, so long as they are reasonable in amount and bear some relation to the cost of upkeep of the port, are port dues in fact whatever they may be in name and fall entirely outside the scope of the Transit Convention. Perhaps some difficulty might be avoided if you made sure that the dues shall be called by some name which did not suggest that they were in fact transit dues.

We have shown Jenkins* letter No. C.R.T. 4744/32 of the 16th August to our Legal Advisers, who consider that the Treaty position is as follows. Article 23(e) of the Covenant of the League provides that members of the League will make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit and equitable treatment for the commerce of all members of the League. By a preamble to this article this obligation is, however, made subject to the provisions of any international conventions which might thereafter be agreed upon. The Barcelona Convention was entered into subsequently, and Article 3 of its Statute provides that traffic in transit shall not be 'subject to any special duties in respect of transit COPY SENT BY AIR r tt (including/ '• Laithwaite, Esq.', y 25 1 t ARY, POLiriOAL AN 1 DEPT. INDIA OFFICEon such ‘»(including entry and exit). Nevertheless “traffic in transit there may he levied dues intended ’solely to defray expenses of supervision and administra 'tion entailed hy such transit”. Assuming the Barcelona Convention to he applicable to the case of Bahrein, it follows that these transit dues will he legitimate if, hut only if, they are levied solely to defray the expenses of supervision and administration entailed hy the transit. The Barcelona Convention is binding on us, hut not directly on Bahrein, since she is not a party to it. In so far, however, as His Majesty’s Government virtually control the foreign relations of Bahrein, it might he held that we were under an obliga tion to persuade the Sheikh to apply these provisions. Admittedly this obligation would be rather an indeter minate one, and we might he able to plead the special circumstances of Bahrein’s finances and the fact that the Sheikh is not a party to the Convention as a justification for the imposition of dues. I gather, however, that the dues at Bahrein will he limited to the amounts necessary to defray the expenses to which the/the State is put hy the transit in question, and if thi is so, no question can possibly arise# In view of the foregoing opinion, and of that expressed in Jenkins 1 letter, you can I think take it that the points raised by us have been disposed of. But as you know, we propose to ask for Ryan*s views on the question before signifying our formal concurrence, and, in accordance with your arrangement with Helm, we shall await a copy of the letter which I understand you are going to send to the Colonial Office before telegraphing to Jedda# I am sending copies of this letter to Jenkins at the Board of Trade, and to Williams at the Colonial Office.INDIA OFFICE, VI/HIT jSHALL, 3.5V. 1. 17th August 1932.

OFFICE, whitehaii.s.w.i. 8th August, 1932 Immediate, Dear Jenkins, «/e should oe grateful for your aavic e on the following point. 2 ihe Sheikh of Bahrein, which, as you are aware, is an independent Arab State under British protection but not a British Protectorate, is precluded by his Treaty of 1861 with His Majesty's Government from charging a duty of more than 5^ ad valorem on goods imported into or re imported from Bahrein by British subjects. Up to 1913 he charged 5$ on all cargo, but in that year he reduced his charges to on cargo destined for the mainland of Arabia but transiting Bahrein. In 1916, on the ground that the effect of the i/ar had been greatly to reduce his customs revenues, he again increased the transit charge to 5$ This produced a protest by Bin Saud, as a result of which, in 1920, the Sheikh was obliged by His Majesty 1 s Governiient to agree to charge 2$ only on transit goods consigned to the mainland, provided that these were removed from the Bahrein customs house within 20 days from the date of landing, and, secondly, that no duty would be charged on goods for the mainland if transhipped from steamers at BahreH direct into lighters. The Sheikh remained free to charge transit duty of 2 &gt;o on goods transhipped direct to lighters or native craft from vessels other than steamers.3. Sheilih is £ or various reasons thp • e oheirJci is now anxious to secure a revision of the 1920 arrangements such as to admit of his charging transhipment duty of 2 % on all g 00Cls destined for the mainland, and transiting Bahrein, whether transhipped direct from steamers to lifters or not. In supporting the Sheikh- s proposals the Government of India remark, inter alia -Although international practice established by Barcelona Convention does not permit duty on goods in transit, it allows levy 0 f dues to cover expense of administration and supervision. We can therefore find no Justification in international custom for entirely free transhipment within territorial waters whether from steamers or dhows rT . 4. fhe foreign Office suggest to us that it is desirable, before we deal with the Sheikh’s request, to clear up whether the charging of the transit dues rex erred to above at Bahrein can be regarded as in accordance with international practice, having regard to the Barcelona Convention. Would you be so kind as to advise?

INBIA OFFICE Dear Jenkins, We should be grateful for your advice on the following point. -• The Sheikh of Bahrein, which, as you are aware, is an independent Arab state under British protection but not a British Protectorate, is precluded by his Treaty of 1861 with H.M.G. from charging a duty of more than 5% ad valorem on goods Imported into or re-exported from Bahrein by British subjects. Up to 1913 he charged 5% on all cargo, but in that year he reduced his charges to 2±% on cargo destined for the mainland of Arabia but transitting Bahrein. In 1916, on the ground that the effect of the War had beer greatly to reduce his customs revenue, he again increased the transit charge to 5%. This produced a protest by Bin Saud, as a result of which, in 1920, the Sheikh was obliged by H.M.G. to agree to charge 2% only on transit goods consigned to the mainland, provided that these were removed from the Bahrein customs I house/(X cLv^-f*- h*~-*0^ 4 rsA. ^r-4 ^, I T - ^ Ct'y^W o* *&lt;*~hA. vy+jl’ V/^VK^^r df^~c^ (£***. y^t&gt;^yb|K^ house within 20 duys irorri the date of landing, and, secondly, that no duty would he charged on goods for the mainland if transhipped from steamers at Bahrein direct into lighters For various reasons the Sheikh is now anxious to secure a revision of the 1920 arrangements such as to admit of his charging transhipment duty of 2% on all goods destined for the mainland,&lt;*--4L whether transhipped (from steamers or not.

My dear George, Your official despatch No.154 ( E 2349/266/25) of May 24, recording a discussion with Fuad Eamza about transit dues at Bahrain:- i oake it that this is for my information only and calls for no action or comment here. I may say, however, that in my opinion Fuad was almost certainly referring to the refusal in 1930 to waive transit dues on rice for Ibn Sa’ftd's troops. He has too good a memory to have forgotten that and I think that, if he had had the Prior arrangement in mind, he would have referred to it explicitly. I still have a divided mind about the Prior arrange- me nt. When I discussed it at home with Christopher Warner, I leant to the view that it involved no clear breach of the under taking given to Ibn Sa'&amp;d in 1920 and might therefore be allowed to stand until he contested it, if he should think fit to do so. I still think that view tenable, but there day be a case for reconsidering the matter on the grounds that (a) The question can be argued both ways; (b) Fuad has now manifested interest in one aspect of Bahrain transit dues and we should escape all possibility °f reasonable reproach by cancelling the prior arrangement; 3491/216/25) , 1697 / 125 / 11 .

Sir, In continuation of my telegram *lo.6 addressed to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies ^o* 366 to His Majesty's Minister, JeddaJ of the 27th June 1932, regarding transhipment cargo at Bahrain, I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of His Majesty's Government copy of a despatch received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, and of a letter addressed to me by Shaikh Hamad bin Isa, Deputy Ruler of Bahrain. 2* I had hoped that the question of this tranship ment cargo, in respect of which a concession was made to Ibn Saud many years ago of which very little advantage had been taken, would not become acute. I visited Bahrain for a day, however, about 10 days ago on my way back from Shargah, and Shaikh Hamad came to see me, and at once raised the question of transhipment cargo. 3. The concession granted to Ibn Saud was two fold and is contained in Colonel Dickson's letter ho. C-196 of 14th July 1920, in which it was laid down that in future only 2 per cent duty would be charged on transit goods consigned to the mainland provided these were y 8 Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London.removed from the Bahrain Customs House within 20 days fran date of landing, and secondly, that if goods were taken from steamers direct into lighters which proceeded to the mainland without touching at Bahrain, no duty would be charged* 4o xn rea Pect of the first concession which deals -vhat is &lt;nown as RE Export (R.E.)cargo, no difficulty has arisen* Extensive use has been made of this concession and large quantities of goods are disembarked at Bahrain and subsequently taken over by dhow to the xNejd coast, and the arrangement works satisfactorily* t&gt;* Hitherto, however, practically no advantage has been taken of the second concession, namely, that of direct tranship ment at sea, without payment of any dues at all* It is an exceedingly inconvenient arrangement for the shipping company since it is difficult to check the goods on the steamer, and secondly their own Agents at Bahrain are also landing contractors and they are naturally averse from losing their landing fees* Latterly, however, a large number of dhows belonging to Kuwait and other places, have brought up extensive consignments of rice to Bahrain and they have been transhipped direct into lighters and taken straight to the Arab coast, the Bahrain Government being in ignorance of the fact that the concession of free transhipment did not extend to goods arriving in native craft* It seems to me impioonb^e that this will recur till next spring. These dhows load dates about September and carry them to Inuia, Aden i oth^. places, formally they bring back timber, and a certain amount of miscellaneous goods, but this year, probably owing to the slackness of trade, they have been unable to obtain their •«»their normal freights, and therefore have loaded rice and brought them up at very low rates to Bahrain. There is no doubt however that the concession does not extend to native craft. Firstly, in Colonel Dickson’s letter to Ibn Saud it is specifically laid down that no duty will be charged if goods are taken from steamers direct into lighters: secondly, when the concession was first imposed on the Bahrain Crovernment, the then Deputy Pol*tica,l Resident, Colonel Trevor, under the authority of the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, addressed a letter to Shaikh Isa, and informed him definitely that this rule was only intended to apply to goods manifested for Hasa, Nejd and ^atar, and brought by steamers. A copy of this letter was forwarded to the Government of India under Bushire letter No.281-3 of 23rd September 1920. It is clear, therefore, that the Bahrain Government are entitled to charge 2 per cent duty on goods brought by dhow, and that Ibn Saud cannot claim free transit on such goods. 6. There remains, however, the question of goods brought by steamer,regard!ng which the local Agent of the Co . British India Steam -uavigation^showed me certain correspond ence that he had had with the Bombay and Karachi Agents. In this they stated that they were being asked to accept consignments of rice provided overside delivery was given and that while the Company did not like this arrangement, at the present time when freight was very scarce they did not feel justified in refusing it. I informed the local Agent l£r* RusseU, that if the Company chose to take goods for overside delivery they were of course entirely at liberty to do so. 7. It will be seen that Shaikh Hamad announces that he proposes to revoke tfcis latter concession, and, for reasons which »• •«which I now give, I think there is much to be said for his contention* When this concession was forced on Shaikh Isa, there was, practically speaking, no administration of any kind in Bahrain and the Bahrain Government had provided no landing or port facilities of any kind© In these circumstances there was no particular reason why shipping using the port of Bahrain should pay anything more than they would if they used any other sheltered bay in the Persian Gulf; such money wmi was received went into Shaikh Isa’s pocket and he there fore deserved no particular consideration* This state of affairs, however, has now radically changed* The -Bahrain Government have provided wharves, lights, beacons, etc*, and it seems only fair that shipping utilizing the facilities of the port should contribute towards its cost, as they do in all civilized ports* At present the Bahrain State levy no port dues. The outer buoys are maintained by the Basrah Conservancy Board, acting on behalf of the Government of India, and for them ships are charged, but some lights have also been provided by the Bahrain Government* It would seem only fair therefore that the Bahrain Government should either be allowed to charge 2 per cent customs duty on all goods brought into their port, or should be entitled to cnsrge port dues. As Shaikh Hamad in his letter points out this agreement was presumably not intended to bind the Sta-e ever and as the Government of India pointed out in another connection, it is generally understood that treaties for the denunciation of which no provision is made hold good rebus sic stantibus . In the present case circumstances Further the Bahrain Government must bave radically changed*-5- in ^u'S easy exei else customs supervision over the transhipment of* tnis cargo, as otherwise the way would be open for extensive smuggling* ihe only really satisfactory method of preventing this is for tne goods to be landed at Bahrain and subsequently re-exp or ted* 8© 1 have in connection with the proposal to grant tariff autonomy to the State of Bahrain pointed out the serious financial difficulties in which the State is at present involved* If the practice of overside delivery becomes universal for all goods destined for flejd it is calculated that the State will lose 25 per cent of its customs revenue - a contingency which I should view with the utmost dismay, and which would, I think, involve the State in such serious difficulties that his Majesty’s Government or the Government of India would be compelled to come to its assistance as they have done in the case of Muscat* 9 6 On the other hand, the suggestion that the State should charge port dues would impose a heavy burden on the shipping interests concerned, the chief of which is the British India Steam Navigation Comjfcany, who would have to pay so much per ton on all their ships entering the por^* I believe that they are at present making very little profit out of their slow mail service, and any additional charge would be very unwelcome. Further, it would probaoly increase the price of the necessities of life to the inhabitants of Bahrain, many of whan are nowadays on the brink of starvation. I would therefore urge that representations should be made to the Hejaz Government on this subject and that the circumstances should be explained to • • •to them, particular emphasis being laid on the fact that since the concession was made conditions have radically changed and that the Bahrain Government have sunk considerable sums in the development of their port while at the same time charging no port dues: that it is only fair that shipping utilizing the port with its present facilities should pay something for these facilities, and that there are two alternatives, either, the abolition of the right of free transhipment, or the levy of port iaes, wh.ch the Bahrain State are clearly entitled to inpose if they see fit; the latter would in the long run probably imrolve higher freight rates from Bombay which would not be in the interests of the Hejaz Government or the people of Nejd and that in these circumstances His Majesty’s Govern- nent trust that the Hejaz-Hejd Government will agree to the discontinuance of the privilege of direct transhipment - a privilege of which actually they have hitherto seldom availed themselves* It might be added that His Majesty’s Government are confident that the Shaikh of Bahrain will as an act of couttesy continue to waive in the future as in the past, all duty on goods for the personal use of His Majesty the King and his household* I must apologise if this despatch is somewhat disjointed* I did not expect to be able to send it off till next weeks I however received Captain Prior’s despatch yesterday, and can just catch today’s air mail# As the matter is one of great urgency I have thought it preferable to submit my views at once in possibly a somewhat crude form rather than delay a week* I am sending a copy of this despatch to HisI4-r? rhinficlential J ji t /S \ I Poyy, ^o.C/104 of 1932, 'Political Agency, Bahrain. I O t&lt; - • • Dated 26th June 1932. From To I he Political Agent, Bahrain. The n on . ble th g p olitical Resident the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, 1 haVe the honou r to forward a letter received from Bis Excellency Shaikh Hamad to your address regarding tranship, men; dues in Bahrain harbour. You will notice that he states his intention of denouncing that part of Shaikh Isa’s letter which allowed transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters. The letter on which His Majesty Bin Saud relies is Major Dickson’s letter Ho.l96-C, dated the 14th June 1920. It wil1 be useful in the first place if I summarise the correspondence that led up to the institution of the RE duty * Throughout this despatch I will refer to the duty as the He Export or RE duty, and to the cargo directly • aken from steamer to boat or from boat to boat as tranship- m ent cargo* Arabs do not use the term RE but usually speak of tranship cargo meaning that which pays 2^, presumably because the transhipment has hardly ever occurred. Till 1913 Shaikh Isa used to charge 5^ on all cargo but he then reduced it tc^i^on all cargo destined for the Finland but discharged at Bahrain. In 1916, on the excuse that the War had greatly reduced his customs he increased this to 5^, this enhanced rate finally leading to a protest from2 - EL Saud &lt;■—Min* , t „ tte ua ^ me ^ “* r ”‘' lon of * u a '' •««« «™,. h „ gro „ a * *s protest and a summary of the matto*. « T-ne matter as it then stood was e.ent to the Hon-ble the Political Resident by the Political Agent in his letter *o.58-C. dated the 2 8th February 1920. The Political Agent expressed the opinion that strictly speaking Bahrain should not charge anything on transit cargo as it was contrary to international practice. To this the Political Resident replied on the lOth March in his telegram «o.553 that there was no recognised scale of duty on transit or transhipment cargo, and that most countries charged some duty based on the principle of not killing the goose that laid the golden ere?. This point is of interest and I will return to it later. In his memorandum *0.72-0, dated the 10th March 1920 the Political Agent reported to the Residency that at an '-'hetikh. *sa had said that on no account would he reduce his duty from 5^ to 2#g in order tc please Bin Saud. he apparently felt that his honour was involred, and said that when he had to reduce his duty for transit cargo in 1913 from 5/a to he had done so of his own free will in order to attract trade. When he had achieved his object he again raised it to 5^ and he said that he would not reduce it again unless forced to do so by the Resident. The Political Agent recommended that he should be pressed to reduce his rate to 2£% but made no mention of free tranship ment at sea. 5 a In his letter No.ll2-C, dated the 27th April to the Political Resident the Political Agent first mentions free transhipment at sea* The natter is now complicated by suggestions-3- suggestions from the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad that Bahrain should be allowed to increase its customs to the Persian scale and so recoup itself for concessions to Bin Saud, hut the resident opposed the suggestion of giving Bahrain more revenue on the grounds that the administration was so rotten that there was no guarantee that any of it would be spent on harbour impcovements. The Civil Commission er at Baghdad in his telegram JNo.6256 dated the 24th May 1920 suggested that the rate of RE duty should be 2 or 2%% and that nothing should be charged on direct transhipment. This is the first mention that I can trace of a 2^ duty, 6. The matter now moved rapidly. The Cxovernment of India apparently agreed to a 2^ RE Export duty and to free tranship ment at sea, and Shaikh Isa was instructed accordingly, Bin Saud and the Ruler of Q,atar being simultaneously informed of the new concession. The reason given to Shaikh Isa by the Resident was that his former practice was 1 not in accordance with existing international law 1 . In his covering letter, the Political Agent informed Shaikh Isa Ijiter alia that w In other words. Your Excellency may possibly shortly be invited to raise the Bahrain Customs tariff to the extent of that fixed by the Persian Government. Should this take place ¥our Excellency may expect to receive a greatly increased revenue from your customs* Such an increase will no doubt be half as much again or possibly double your existing revenues '• 7. Shaikh Isa received the news badly and immediately asked to be allowed to return to the old 2-%% rate he had previously refused to concede® Shaikh Isa apparentalso sked that the free transhipment at sea should not be forced on him. The Political Agent discussed these points in his forwarding . • •.4. forwarding letter Ho.228 of the 3rd Auguat 1920. The Reeident informed Shaikh Isa that the orders of Government must be obeyed, and sent three letters to him with his letter Ko«2f&gt;3-S of 28th August 1920 to the Political Agent. The first told him that he must carry out the orders of Government without demur, and the third warned him against mischief makers. The second is of the greatest importance for I now ^find m its penultimate paragraph that he informs Shaikh Isa that the free transhipment at sea is only intended to apply to goods that come by steamer. If shaikh Isa had not been in his dotage he would have produced this letter long ago X) and the difficulty of country craft discharging cargo direct into other country craft and escaping customs dues would never have arisen. Since it is manifestly unfair that the State should be ignorant of an important letter like this owing to Shaikh Isa’s incapacity, I propose to give a copy of it to the Adviser unless you instruct me by telegram to refrain from doing so. 8. Shaikh Isa yielded before the unrelenting pressure of the Resident and finally accepted the terms, though with an ill grace. Shortly afterwards another question arose. Hitherto, by private arrangement, he had allowed baled goods to pass for Bin Saud* s territory unopened at a charge of Rs* 15/- per bale. This was to obviate the difficulty of rebaling goods that had been packed under pressure, and since it was calculated that an average bale was worth not less than Rs. 1,000/- the arrangement was to Bin Saud’s benefit. Shaikh Isa now ordered, however, that such goods should be opened to assess their value and collected. The Resident declined to intervene, but the matter was finally settled locally by Rs.20/« being accepted instead of Rs.15/- and the bales were allowed to pass as before. 9.9. I now come to His Excellency Shaikh Haciad’s letter. It may be broadly summed up as saying that though all avail, able economies have been made the State is in sore need of money, and since he can no longer afford to give free tran- shipment, which, moreover he considers an infringement of hi sovereign rights, he intends to cancel the clause of Shaikh Isa's letter which allowed it. 10. This action has been precipitated by two things. During this spring, return freights by country craft(mostly from Kuwait) from Karachi to Bahrain fell to unprecedentedly low rates. The British India Steam Navigation Company were unable to reduce their rates to meet this and consequently a number of booms, some containing as much as a thousand sacks of rice came to Bahrain and transhipped their cargo to smaller car ft from Jubail and Ojair without paying a penny to the Bahrain Government, The second point is that news has been redeived that a Karachi shipper offered the British India Steam Navigation Company 35,000 bags of rice on the sole condition that they will allow him overside delivery,i.eo enable him to secure free transhipment. The conjunction of these two factors has much alarmed the Bahrain Government and the merchants since they see their entrepot trade being conducted under their noses and in their port without the Government being able to obtain revenue from it or the merchants their trade, I should mention, that for a variety of reasons it is, practically speaking, only possible for Nejd and Hasa merchants to profit by this direct traffic, and the Bahrain merchants though liable to the competition of others in the home market find themselves shut out of the trade of the mainland. 11. Since Shaikh letter prescribed no time limitand since it was not a formal treaty but a private arrangement and since he received no compensating advantage, it is clearly open to the son to rescind a concession granted by the father* Bahrain, as we have frequently stated, is an Independent Arab State and has a perfect right tc levy such dues and make such arrangements in its territorial waters as may seem good to it* As I have mentioned above, the Resident himself stated that the usual practice of States was to take what could be taken without killing the goose that lays the golden eggs* 12. Y/hen the concession was originally forced upon Shaikh Isa, much play was made of the argument that other ports such as Bombay charged nothing for transhipment, itfhat is done elsewhere is of little value as a guide in a place like the Persian Gulf, which is a law unto itself, but apart from this the argument is fallacious for the transhipment referred to in these ports is that of cargo on a through manifest for onward transmission by another steamer to another steamer port* Bahrain is strictly speaking the destination of transhipment cargo here,for the mainland ports cannot by any stretch of imagination be called steamer ports nor do the merchants who ship the cargo live there. 13. The Port of London and other great ports grant cheap transit facilities because it suits their policy to do su, and if they did not rival ports shoulc soon take the.r entrepot trade from them. The situation here is entires different. The Hasa and hejd merchants who import on a large scale do not live in their own country, but prefer to conduct their business from the peace and security of Bahrain They take full advantage of the facilities of the port, and send their children free to Bahrain sbhools, use Bahrain . , . potion of the Bahrain State hospitals and enjoy the protect.cu ux forces. • •I -7. forces. Since the Customs dues provide almost the sole source of revenue in the State it is only reasonable to expect that they should be expected to contribute something to them. It should be remembered that no port dues exist here except on launches and unless Customs dues are paid the transhipment traffic does not pay a penny. 14. As the Shaikh says in his letter conditions have changed since Shaikh Isa signed his letter. Transhipment from steamers was then unknown, and he could not have foreseen (though we should have foreseen for him) that as much as 35,000 bags of rice at a time might desire to make use of this loophole. It is clear that transhipment from country craft to country craft did exist (Pfilitical Agent's letter Mo.228-C, dated the 3rd August 1920 to the Political Resident) but on the other hand it is equally clear that Shaikh Isa used to collect 5&gt; on all goods so transhipped. 15. In view of the Resident’s assurance to Shaikh Isa that the free transhipment only applied to goods transhipped from steamers to country craft I presume that I may inform the Shaikh immediately that he is at liberty to charge the full 2^ on cargo transhipped from one country craft to another without any further delay, and this will only leave the question of steamer transhipment. 16. It must be quite clear that once transhipment from steamers is allowed on the scale contemplated, it is only a Question of months before the entire entrepot trade is con ducted in this way, the local and Hindu merchants being competitors in Bahrain will be able to compete in the Bahrain ra&amp;rket as heretofore. Exactly why the advantage to be gained by free transhipment from steamers was not realisedaEd UtlllZed - arllHr &gt; 1 cannot say, but I believe that the answer lay in the reluctance of the British India Steam navigation Company to allow it. They will always prefer to have their cargo landed by their agents in Bahrain, and but for the recent competition of country craft would never agree to any other procedure. Bow that in the terms of Colonel Trevor’s letter, country craft is not allowed free tranship, ment, they will not have this competition to fear to the same extent and will be less ready to grant it* 17. 3in -aud appears to be under the impression that he has a grievance as regards Bahrain, whereas the local opinion is that we have fostered his interests and those of his merchants /ather than those of Bahrain. When, after the War, permits for the export of rice were hard to obtain, we made the Qusaibis’ fortune by granting them permits where others had to go without, and when the RE Export concession was first introduced it was restricted to JNejd and Hasa merchants, thereby giving them a 3^ advantage over the Bahrain merchant desiring to trade with the mainland. 18. Under what obligations are we to Bin Saud that his interests must prevail every time ? It seems to me that when it suits him he is allowed to quote r international practice* and that when it does not suit him he is allowed to plead * the requirement of his country *• He is allowed to blockade Kuwait in time of peace and expel Hindu merchants like criminals from his shores because they ventured tc compete with his merchants, and this time no word is heard of inter national practice© If the Government of India decided to expel Japanese merchants from Bombay because they ^ere found to be doing good business, the Japanese Government would probably ...probably consider it an act of war. 19. Again, I have just discovered that while his subjects in Bahrain are all treated on perfect equality with Bahrainis and pay identically the same taxes, he on the other hand levies a higher rate of tax from Bahrain subjects on their date gardens there then that paid by his subjects, the difference being some 18/6. It will be clearly seen that his policy is based entirely on self interest and expediency and that any mention of international practice is a blind. 20. It should be clearly realised that free transhipment on a large scale will still further retard the raising of the Kuwait blockade. i‘he port that is being used as a substitute for Kuwait is Jubail, and If Bin Saud is able to take his supplies there without any payment of dues at all at Bahrain, he will obviously prefer to use that port and will maintain the full rigour of his blockade against Kuwait. Jubail itself is impracticable for steamers and he can only therefore approach it free of charge by means of such a concession at Bahrain. 21. The Bahrain Government have made drastic economies but there is obviously a limit to this, for unlike their neighbours they have a more or less civilised Government to maintain. They have made immense improvements in the last few years, so much so that they are attracting immigrants from all over the Gulf. Their administration cannot, however, be maintained for nothing, and if thwarted in this matter of transhipment dues they will probably recompense themselves by levying drastic port dues, which they would be perfectly entitled to do. I need hardly say that this would be most unwelcome to the British India Steam Navigation Company and if, as might easily happen, the Persians were to hear of it and imitate them the result would be most ...T3 - 10 - Most unfortunate, for them. xhe Bahrain Government have sunk a great deal of money in the port and appointed a British Customs Director and Port Officer and they are entitled to an adequate return for their outlay apart from any consideration of revenue. 2?. The Bahrain Government must, however, be careful to avoid killing the goose which would not be so very difficult, for with adequate buoying and piers Ras Tan^rah could be turned into a port that would take a great deal of trade away from Bahrain. Whether they could persuade steamers to go there or not is another matter, but I believe that it could be done. I do not consider that they are likely to do this as long as the RE Export duty is maintained as low as 2^ and I do not think that the withdrawal of the transhipment concession will be suffi cient to incite them to develop Ras lan^rah. At the present moment, there is little doubt that they could not afford it. 23. I am advising Shaikh Hamad that he should await a reply from you before denouncing Shaikh Isa’s letter since it was based on the orders of the Government of India. I considers (a) Since the arrangement is based on a letter and not on a treaty or formal undertaking he can abrogate it at will, the more particularly since he received no quid pro quo and conditions have changed. (b) Baiirain is an independent State and entitled to do what it pleases in territorial waters® The tranship ment traffic must be controlled even if only to prevent smuggling* Since there are often 50 or more ships in harbour this cannot be done without expense. (c) International practice means nothing in these primitive countries, and is only used by Bin Baud as ammunition against us and not as a guide to be followed. Bahrain is sui generis for no where else that I am aware of do leading merchants of one country live in and transact, their country's trade from another* 24© I request therefore, that His Majesty King Bin Baud may be informed that the Bahrain Government regret that they are obliged to • • •to discontinue the free transhipment concession since it will dislocate the trade of their country. It might be mentioned to him that the old rate of RE duty was 2^ but that, we secured its reduction to 2% for him 0 25. Finally I request that I may be allowed to inform the Bahrain Government that they may put a stop to free transhipment from country craft to country craft forthwith and that they may levy 2)o duty upon it. Strictly speaking they are still entitled to charge 5% on it. i'his is covered by Colonel Trevor*s letter and does not form part of Major Dickson’s letter to His Majesty Bin Saud which only prescribed free transhipment for goods transhipped from steamer to country craft. It would be in equitable to withhold this information from them since it is only due to the fact that we were dealing with a Shaikh in his dotage that the knowledge was not made use of before.

We would point out to lour excell ency that XX this written arrangement did not prescribe any tine limit for the arrangement. Conditions have changed in Bahrain very great ly since that time and now, and what is fitting at that time is not fitting today* neither did we believe that the xjpl arrangement made 12 2 /-ears ago was at that time intended to permanently bind the (xovemnent of ba^rain for ever after. At the time that the above letter was written it was not the custom to transfer cargo from one boat to another in the water within the boundaries of Bahrain, and when Shaikh isa was asked he did not think that such a thing would happen, because all cargo imported for the ports of His Majesty ibn uaud used to fenter Bahrain first, and then it was sent, to the ports of the Hing and it was only because of this that shaikh Isa agreed to the request of the High Government . And now we intend to alter + he clause mention ed/mentioned in shaikh Isa's letter to the Hon'ble the political Kesiaent which refers to the direct transhipment from boat to boat with- i n ; e boundaries of our country, because we now see that it is harmful to us a.nd to our country, T hnng the la^t three months a new thin^ has oc/urred against our trade. Sailing boats of large sixe from India and Xrac[ liave entered our harbours loaded with cargo and hare discharged their goods into other boats in the sea with^in our boundaries and 1he boats have carried the goods to foreign ports, iet this trade has been carried on with no payment what-j ever of Customs or anything else, and we con sider that this is not right. If they use our port for unloading the cargo they must pay Customs duty i^e., 2% and be treated as is treated Rjfi* cargo, i*e., the cargo should land on the Bahrain pier and then be re shipped as usual. In the last three months we have lost about Ks, 16,000 of Cubans duty through tiie action of these boats, and nov. that it is intended to do this by steamer the loss will be much greater* xhis practice is also dangerouB because it mahss it possible for ohe entry o* geo us into Bahrain by smuggling for we a’ o no knowledge or authority over these goods, and we dc not know where these goods go to, and what, they are and what they contain* we 2 eve siuj. islands in our country and in eveiy island there are harbours, and cargo can be landed at any/3^/ i-c se pi ace s, ani it is generally that much cargo enters .balli&amp;in by simiggling methods. Also it is our right to control imports and. exports within our boundar ies and our subjects are amazed that we are not alls to do this. In countries such as Iraq this practice is forbidden, uur merchants are also being injured because the foreign merchants who live in our country are importing goods for the country of nis Majesty ibn saud through bat.rain without paying Customs duty in -Bahrain, but our own merchants have to pay Customs and sc they cannot compete with the foreign merchants in the trade in the country oi* His Majesty ibn Saud, nor can we help them as our hands are paralysed by the writing which made the arrangement on the subject. in the interests of our country and revenue and trade we have decided to cancel this arrangement, that is, direct transhipment from boat to boat within our frontiers, we do not ask to take Customs outside our boundaries, but we have dec idee to take on goods directly transhipped from boat to boat within our boundaries.

Harbour site at Ras Tannura . By road this is 56 kilometres and is north east from A1 Katif measuring about 18 kilometres in a straight line from A1 Katif. As far as I can see this locality gives an excellent deep water harbour for ships of many sizes, but before stating up to what size the best charts should be obtained and studied, also a certain amount of surveys with soundings should be done to verify the accuracy of the charts. The strongest winds are said to blow from the north. This harbour is well protected from the north and east, less so fran the west and still less from the south. High winds from the latter direction are stated to last but one or two days. The pier so far completed extends into one metre of water with the deck at 1.3 metres above the water. As some of the surface is washed out by the sea it proves that the pier should be made higher. It should also be made much longer extending into ample water for deep sea going vessels to tie up alorgside. Before deciding on a structure accurate surveys should be made. Also the matter of concrete piles and concrete construction should ce investigated. There is a big flat area to the east and north Ox the pisr sufficient to construct warehouses, stores, shops, residents etc. The required amount of drinking water can be obtained by hauling it in tank waggons or trailers, fron Aine Raheema, only 15 kilometres distant, but it is to be hoped that ample water may be obtained by drilling wells. I can see no adverse indications. A4S5 A good road must be constructed along the point to the mainland - a total distance of 7 tons but only 4 tons are in deep sand. The best method if cheap crude oil is available is uo sprinkle the sandy road with it. If oil is too expensive clay should be repeatedlj mixed with the sand. A foundation of stones is preferable, but if too expensive palm branches will serve for a time, if actively repaired and maintained. Ii a port is oo be constructed, the surveys in the harbor, the drilling of the wells, and the construction of the road should be vigorously prosecuted, the buildings can be done later. me transhipment duty of ad valorem would be saved for this country and government revenue would be obtained by ..ar^or dues, quarantine taxs etc.as well as employment given to a seaport personnel. Furthermore there could be no foreign supervision or restraint of any material ordered by y our G-overnrnent. I can see only advantages resulting from the establishment of a deep water port at Has Tanura, but of course, it will cost a considerable amount of money depending on the nature and size of works and equipment. At Bahrain there is only one derrick, it has a capacity of six tons and is operated by hand - it has been installed only one year but has given great benefit. Such a crane is not very expensive and would be suitable for here. Light cars and tracks would be the only other equipment necessary at first.jotes. jlinute Paper.

Ibn Baud was on strong ground in asking that some concession should be made to him in this respect. 4. Whether it was necessary to make the further concession that goods transhipped direct should pay no duty at all is open to ar uaent, but anyhow hitherto very little advantage has been taken of this privilege. ar. Hope Gill considers that Ibn Baud could contend that we have clrcum~ vented this concession, but I am inclined to doubt whether 11 is a live issue at the present moment.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to Government of India telegram Ho.764 dated the 11th March 1932 and to say that since my action has Been brought to the notice of lie Secretary of State and H.B.M.’s Minister at Jedda, I may, perhaps, be allowed to offer some explanation, the more so since I believe I can show that the suggestion that I concluded a formal agreement with the British India Steam Navigation Company is misleading. 2. I was in Isfahan when the question of overside deliveries was first raised by the Government of Bahrain, who proposed to levy the full 2% rate of Re Export duty on the cargo transhipped at sea by the 3.8. 'Bankura* due at Bahrain towards the end of September. I discus eu. vht matter with the Officiating Political Resident and the Bahrain Government were informed from Bushire that the orders of Government precluded this, but they took up the matter energetically with the Agents of the Company and telegraphed to me again on my arrival at Karachi, ihe Hindu shippers at Bahrain and Karachi also made represen a- tions to myself, the Hon’ble the Political Resident and the Director General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics,Statistics, Calcutta, 3, the shipping for overside delivery had taken place from Karachi, and as a result of the energetic protests of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation at Bahrain, Messrs Maokinnon, Mackenzie and Company had stopped the practice, having only given overside delivery from two steamers. I saw their i^irachi Manager and found that he had already decided to accept no further cargo of this nature for the time toeing, I did not make this point clear in my letter Mo ,0/118 dated the 28th Hovemtoer 1931, He stated, however, that he had toeen told toy the shipper that the additional dues at Bahrain made it profitable to ship toy country craft direct, and so short circuit Bahrain and all its dues, and that they could not afford to lose cargo to sailing craft, 4, He referred, of course, to the extra khanchiyah or demurrage charge levied last year, which added some Iffl to the Bahrain dues, and whose application I had objected to at the time as toeing likely to divert trade, I offered to ask the Bahrain Governaent to remove this khanchiyah, and so to revert to the former position of he Export cargo. He said this would facilitate matters and the Bahrain Govern ment agreed to it. 5, The Karachi Manager informed me, however, that he .as unable to settle mattere of policy without a reference to Bombay and that though he personally did not intend zo accept any more such cargo he was referring to Bombay, and advlsfd me to write to them too. As the question had not been definitely settled, it seemed advisable to wri te to Bombay and place the point of view of the Bahrain Government and the Hindu merchants (who had also made energetic protests ) before them. I pointed out that the Bahrain GovernmentGovernment had foregone the extra khanohiyah and reverted to the former position and also said that the State could not afford to lose the revenue and would certainly make it up hy other means, if they lost it by overside delivery# 6. I do not think it can be said that this was an 'agreement* nor that I exceeded my duty in taking up a matter which vitally affected the Bahrain Government, the Hindu merchants and the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, It is a purely commercial matter in which the British India Steam Mavigation Company have pleased themselves, as uhey are entitled to do. Unless they are afraid chat they are going to lose cargo to sailing craft, they will never agree to give overside delivery, as this leads to endless difficult- ties and in the sole instance in which it has occurred during my tour of duty here, excluding last year,(itot i.e. when aims were shipped from India for the Kejd Government)the steamer was delayed for 24 hours. Kven last year they did not give overside delivery for consignments of less an 1000 bags owing to these very difficulties. The Government of India will realize from this that the matter is not quite so simple as it appeal's. 7. I wish to say that I had no knowledge of the le cter written by Colonel Dickson to His Majesty King Bin Baud stating that no duty would be charged on goods transhipped direct at sea. The War and lack of staff had reduced the Agency office work to chaos and in 1928 all confidential files of earlier date were closed and new ones opened, and I regret to say that 1 have never found time to read these old one s. On receiving the reference from the aushire Residency, however, I managed to trace the file and have now read it with useful results. 1 was aware that the reduction of transit dues to 2* had been forced on Shaikh Isa in • • • •in the teeth of the strongest opposition, hut it now appears quite clear that our sole motive appeal’s to have been to placate Bin Saud at the expense of this unfortunate State. At one place I find the Political Hesident infoiming che Shaikh that “in accordance with international practice no charge should be levied on goods in transit' while Shaikh Isa pathetically replies 'he is certain that there are also things in his favour in international practice, if he only knew of them'. That he is not far wrong is disclosed by the example of ‘Iraq where 1% is charged upon all goods at the present moment. 8. I have discovered one valuable fact from the Political Agent’s letter Ho.C/228 to the Residency dated the 3rd August 1920. He states 'no cargo is ever at present transhipped 'from steamers at sea dnd taken direct to the mainland. There is no prospect of such a thing happening in the luture as tar as I can see, seeing that the Landing Company, also a Brit-sh India Steam Navigation Company’s concern, is intereBced in landing all cargo at Bahrain. They would lose heavily i- ca-go were put direct into lighters for the mainland, hence the British India/ Steam Navigation Company may be counted upon to distinctly discourage transfer of cargo. Shaikh Isa therefore stands to lose nothing by Government’s order as ar as concerns steamers transferring cargo 4 • It will be seen ^hat though bound by treaty to protect the State’s interests we actually were instrumental in fettering its lioerty in advance• 9. It should be mentioned at this point that the Anglo- Ptrsian Oil Company’s steamer, the 8 . 8 . 'Khuzistan' now regularly discharges oil here for the mainland by direct transhipment, and in accordance with Government’s orders no charges are levied upon this. The Bahrain Government wished to * • »to protest again si this, tut I pointed out to them that the steamer had a yoy small draught and could easily stand into some place on the Hasa coast if they applied the Be hxport duties, and that this vouldjcreate an undesirable precedent. Also they do not 'bring a very large quantity of cargo and the loss to the State is not great, with the British India Steam navigation Company, however, it is very different and since it is to the interest of both the British India Steam navigation Company, the Bahrain Government and the Hindu merchants not to allow overside delivery, I most strongly urge that they should not be pressed to do so. If the Hejd Government considered they had a grievance they would long ago have raised the matter, and the fact of their not having done so clearly shows that they realize the British India Steam navigation Company are within their rights in refusing overside delivery if it does not suit them 10. I notice that His Majesty's Minister at Jedda is to be called upon to say whether the spirit ot the 1920 ar a ; ~ ment has been infringed or not. Surely this State, which stands to lose heavily should have some say in the matter, and it is surely wrong that no mention of it should be made to them? Do not the Government of India feel that the time has come to cease calling upon Bahrain to make sacrifices to benefit our relations with Bin Saud? ihis vi^aiious generosity has cost the Government of Bahrain over cen iaxhs since the institution of the arrangement, or roughly 10^ of their income. What would the Government of India and the Indian public say if it was known that His Majesty's Govern- ment, while charged with the protection of their interests, had obliged them for political reasons to surren e. i-0/fc of their revenues in favour of a foreign power ? It will be recalled • • • •recalled that the Kimberley Cotton Excise imtiea were conceived in something of this spirit, and I believe that there is no Enactment that His Majesty^ Government would sooner have seen undone, or one which has done more to damage our prestige in India. 11 . The reduction of the transit dues from to 2/&amp; caused bitterness at the time, and though this has now died down, it will be instantly revived if the Bahrain State are to be called upon to make further sacrifices, particularly at such a time as the present. The Arabs are quite intelligent enough to know exactly what motives inspire our action and they will realise that we are helping the strong against the weak, and the less friendly against the friendw I have heard it suggested that Bahrain is deeply indebted to us. Our contaot with it has certainly contributed to its prosperity, but I cannot recall any action that has not been acen in own interests as much as in those of Bahrain, nor any action that has caused us to be out of pocket. It will be remembered that when the two platoons of Indian infantry were sent here in 1926 the State were called upon to pay for their expenses to the last penny. further, the State have granted un hesitatingly facilities for aviation for which we have un successfully offered very large subs elsewhere. She Bahrain Arabs are among the few peoples I know who are genuinely friendly towards us. ani it would be a tragedy if we were to jeopardise their friendship to benefit a State *ose friendship exists only in name. 12. It must not be lost sight of that the Hindu aerchants are vitally affected since their mainland trade will e r^e: if overside delivery becomes a practice. ihey have much better means of ventilating their grievances than the Bahrain Government-7- Governaont and will make full use of them, and this should be taken into account* 13c In conclusion, I truet that my contention that the matter is a purely commercial one may be accepted. If the British India Steam Havigation Company are forced by commercial reasons to grant overside delivery, the Bahrain Government will have to bow to the inevitable and take such steps as they deem fit to restore the lost revenue. I beg, however, that the Government of India will not of their own motion bring pressure to bear upon the British India Steam Havigation Company to give such delivery.

It is however understood that cargo on which only 2 per cent is to be levied is consigned by name to certain merchants on the mainlancf 'via Bahrain' and c/o their Agents at Bahrain and that the said cargo is re-exported from Bahrain to the mainland ports within 20 days from date of landing. Full duty may be levied on any cargo which remains longer than that period in your island. I trust that the above instructions are clear to Your excellency. I may add that the Great Powers are considering the quest ion of transit dues and eventually .av .da^e a convention on the subject# The above instructions are without prejudice to any advice which Government may find it necessary to give Your Excellency when the convention is made.4 4^1 Translation of a letter dated 8th Zilqadeh I3 38( t 25 th July from the Shaikh of Bahrain, to the Qeput|\if Uio^ Resident,Persian Gulf, Bushire. ! 2154 • • • • • ( 1932 j I have duly received your letter Bo.303, dated 26th Ramzan 1338 ( 14th June 1920Jin which you communicate to me the orders of the 'Government of India about the levying of a special tax on goods arriving at Bahrain and passing into the territories of the Rulers of Bejd and Katar. These orders are divided into two classess- (1) That I should levy only a .2 per cent tax on goods consigned to the neighbouring interior Arab State which are landed at Bahrain, and {2} That I should not levy any tax on the goods tranship ped directly from the steamers to the boats of Arab ports which proceed to these ports direct. v I had already learnt that the Ruler of Ifejd had addressed the Government of India, but I certainly expected that the nigh Government would enquire from me about my arguments on this question, after I had heard about it from the Ruler of ITejd, before issuing their orders. But, I reget to say, contrary to yy expectation, these orders arrived. In spite oi this, sure as I am of the justice of the High Government, they will reconsider their orders after they come to know of their injurious results to their friend *5 righus. With regard to the fir st( class of) orders I beg to inform the High Government that the treaty between us restricts me to taking not more than 5 per ce nt from British subjects, only on goods arriving at ray town irrespective of their destination. The levying by me of more than ti^is, or my oc in.^ .^w^ced to levy less than-this, is txsda indeed clearly contrary to the t rea ty. As.As to the present c, se, we u a ed to levy, during the years prior to war, 2* per cent or. the goods proceeding to Hassa and Katii via Bahrain. This considerate treatment was accorded by me of my own accord without having been asked, and only as a consideration for the commercial interests of my town, and is not ^n argument for forfeiting iny rights under the treaty. Ax ter trie comme ncement of the war, when imports decreased ond expenses increased as in ocner towns, we y/ere compelled to recover our full rights in that time. Correspondence was exchanged between me and the Political Agent, Bahrain,Major Stewart, who agreed to this according to justice, and for about 6 months the Rule r of ITejd asked me to repeat the former considerate treatment in favour of his territory,viz, that I should levy a 2^- per cent tax. But in view of the unchanged economical conditions, which forced me first to charge full dues, I did not agree to lessen them. The Ruler of lie jd, I understand, requests me to allow him a reduction under the international laws and the High Indian Government agrees to this, and, in addition, allows him more I than what he asked for. But I do not understand the reality of international laws, and it is the first time I understand that international laws apply to two Arab Rulers to the detriment of one of them who always flattered himself for hi friendship and loyalty to the High Government and also in spite of treaties and current rules which are known to the Go ve rr^nent• Perhaps the international law is more useful to 1 me in another Vi/ay and does not, I think, restrict me to the levying of 5 per cent only. But your friend, according to his custom, respects treaty better than proiit. s How,ifow t in order to continue ray old friendship and loyalty and in deference to the interference of the High Government I agree to the first (class of) orders according to their conditions as described in the Governments orders, and only trust that the matter be re-considered with a view to the 2-5 per cent being levied as requested by the Ruler of Nejd* ns to the second (class of) orders, which, to be brief, prohibit me from levying any tax on goods directly shipped from snips into the boats of tne Arab ports proceeding to those ports direct* The meaning of this is that my port,on account of its facilities which are utilized by the Ruler of ifejd, becomes his port, and no doubt he can, whenever he desires, land goods according to the above mentioned arrange ment. This renders easy for him the importation,especially, of rice and other grains generally. This is very injurious to me, (l) in respect of my products and ( 2 ) in respect of my rights as an owner, being contrary to my expectation and title to the High Government. I am unwilling to believe that the High Government, whose advice I always follow, will now force me to forfeit my right to benefit another person without his having any right and at his request contrary to other Rulers, though I have left my relations with them in the hands ol the High Government. In justice I expect from them to safeguard my rights from the transgression of others as they do theirs. I sincerely hope that they will reconsider it (the mattei; and be kind enough to prevent the emo I'cement this evidently1 Telegram Code Ho. 1484, dated nth aAM p 7 , i ?

X must observe that the Treaty regarding payment of o per cent duty on goods for British subjects in Bahrain applies to goods destined for Bahrain and remaining there and not to goods in transit for other places. This argument is therefore entirely irrelevant. How would merchants in Bahrain like it rf, when they order goods from Burope direct, the full Indian duty were charged at Bombay simply bees rse 4 a* thorp from a London steamer to the goods were transnipped there •t the ore sent time they charge nothing a Gulf steamer, ^t the press 1 i hiod in harbour and only l- 8 tn ox tne duu&gt; on cargo transhipped, m nd.uoui , , Tf the High Government had given you on cargo landed.

As/%3 regards Your Excellency^ suggestion that 2 ^ per cent should be allowed* I beg leave to point out that our friend Major Dickson spent one week in trying to persuade you to agree to this amicably, and I myself ♦ 4 sent a message to you suggesting that this was the rate in 1913 when the Ruler of 2Jejd first turned out the Jurks and suggesting that it should oe reverted to, but you refused to listen. Then the matter had to be referred to the High Government and became the subject of an order, and therefore it was fixed at 2 per cent. I would remind Your Excellency that the Ruler of ifejd intended that no duty at all should be charged but only ardhiyeh. The High Government itself only charges l-3th duty. It is for tunate therefore for Your Excellency that the order did not say you could only charge l-8th duty i.e.» 5-8th of one per cent. In regard to the second part of the order as I have said above the High Sovernraent does not (nor do other Great Governnents) charge any duty at all on direct ship ments, and in this no infringement of sovereign rigits or any others are involved. Uo state has a right to charge duty on goods destined for another country *ich simply comes to one of its ports by the chances of routes of shipping, and are not even landed on its shores.

It would hit the Indian mercantile communityhard. It would # I think, give rise to a good deal of resentment. These transit dues which were forced on Bahrain have always been a sore point. (iv) Ibn Baud has not yet protested, and actually the British India Bteam navigation Company or any other shipping company are perfectly entitled to refuse to accept goods tb r over side delivery; and the B.

(bora 1848, succeeded loud), was relieved oi control of the administration in 19 9 3 by the Government of India with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, but remains titu ai kheikh ol the Islands, his eldest surviving son, Sheikh Hamad, (1021) (born lb/4, right of succession publicly recognised by Government of India in 1901, entitled to a salute of seven guns) who has three sons, born m 1895 (Sheikh Salman), 1898 and 1902, and two brothers Sheikh Mohammed (born 1877) and Sheikh Abdulla, C.I.E. (1915) (born 1880k having taken over responsibility for the administration as the fully empowered agent of his father. Sheikh Isa, although no longer in fact the ruler of Bahrein, is understood to continue to carry weight locally, and his wife, a vigorous and unscrupulous lady in the sixties, who prior to his deposition was stated completely to dominate her husband, remains an important influence in the State. 2. I he principality is an independent Arab State, under the protection of His Majesty’s Government, but not a British Protectorate. Its ruler is precluded by his engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of treaties appended to this Memorandum, from receiving the representatives of, or entering into relations with, foreign Powers, and from ceding, selling, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, save to His Majesty’s Government, any part of his territory. He is bound to suppress the slave trade, and to prohibit traffic in arms, within his territory, and he is precluded from granting a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, save with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh (Hamad), assisted since 192G by a European Financial Adviser* (Mr. 0. Dalrymple Belgrave) and since 1924 by a European Director of Customs (Mr. de Grenier),I who has, it is understood, been given a year’s notice, expiring in June 1929, on the initiative of the Government of India, and a European Chief of Police who is also Assistant to the Financial Adviser (Captain L. S. Parke). J All these officers are servants of the Sheikh and are paid j Tei.from Pol.Kes.tos. from Bahrein funds. Their contracts and their conditions of service, like 11 their original selection for employment, were, however, approved by the p. 3070 . Government of India. 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are repre sented in Bahrein by thg Political Agent, Bahrein (at present Lt.-Col. C. C. J. Loi l &gt; i)31 - Barrett, C.S.L, C.I.E., formerly First Assistant Resident at Aden), an appointment created in 1904, and borne on the cadre of the Political Department of the Government of India. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty’s Commission as a Consul, and exercises no consular functions. Under the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, as amended by the Bahrein (Amendment) Order in Council of 1922, he is. the Ifistrict Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises jurisdiction (subject to appeal to the Court of the Political Resident) in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. His jurisdiction in the case of foreigners, exercised in the case of foreigners other than Nejdis since 1904— 0 , was regularised by the Order in Council of 1913 (which, owing first to the undesnability of complicating the 1913-4 negotiations with 9 urkey and then to the war, was not actually brought into operation until February 1919) and was extended to cover all foreigners in 1920. * Appointed for four years in the first instance, subject to three months’ notice from June 1926, on Rs. 1,000—50—2,200, &amp;o.

His Lxcellency explained in 1912 that by “ foreigners ” he had not intended the dependants of petty Arab potentates in the Gulf, a contention which was accepted by His Majesty’s Government in 1919, but yv nch, in view of the attitude of the Arab chiefs affected, it proved impossible, as explained below, to continue to entertain. The Order in Council approved by the King in 1913, the introduction of which was postponed till 1919, limited the jurisdiction of the Political /\oent to foreigneis with respect to whom the Sheikh has agreed with His Majesty ioi\ oi consented to, the exercise ol jurisdiction by His Majesty.’’ Certain minor administrative improvements were effected by the Sheikh from time to time under strong pressure from the Political Agent; in 1911 His Excellency agieecl not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Office in Bahrein and not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners!; a wireless station was erected in 1JI2; with great difficulty the Sheikh was persuaded between 1912 and 1911 to remedy the grievances of traders in regard to landing arrange- nients &gt; an( ^ the handling and storage of cargo at Bahrein^; after some discussion he agreed in 1914§ not to search for oil himself or give others pei mission tu do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India (subsequent developments as regards oil concessions in Bahrein are dealt with in para. 19 below); responsibility for the quarantine duties, which had caused some difficulty m the pmst, ] was taken over in 1916 by the Government of India; the attitude of the Sheikh and his sons during the war was correct, the position as between the ruling family and their subjects steadily detenoiated ; administration lapsed until it could be reported in 1922 as ai behind the times in comparison with other Arab States ’’ v '', th e aigoted incapacity of the Sheikh (to quote the Political Hesident in 1911)i the corruption or weakness of members of bis family, and the succession ol tyrannical acts perpetrated by the Sheikh, his wife and his sons, not only gave rise to increasing popular discontent, but, since the Political v as not m a position to intervene effectively (the energies of His Majesty s o^ernmerit and the Government of India being elsewhere engaged), reacte unfavourably on our position in the Islands. 9.

Bray, Major Dickson, then Political Agent, the Political Resident and the Civil Commissioner Mesopotamia, the Government of India on 5th May 1920* informed Sheikh Abdulla that the procedure for the selection of the members of the Majlis was laid down in the Bahrein Order in Council and that it was not within then competence to alter it, but that in practice the Arab representatives were understood to be appointed by Sheikh Isa, and that although this appointment was subject to the approval of the Political Agent as representing the Protecting Power, the Political Agent would never interfere or refuse his approval without just cause ; that as regards his third point, the request was an old one which had received much consideration, and that the Government of India*remained unable to accede to it in view of the difficulties involved ; while as regards direct correspondence, the political relations of Bahrein were conducted with the Government of India and that it was proper therefore that His Excellency should address them and not His Majesty’s Government. The} 7 would if necessary forward his correspondence to His Majesty’s Government. As regards the first and most important request, the Government of India agreed that he should exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab rulers, subject to the formal concurrence of those rulers. Ibn Saudf, however, and the Sheikh of Katr, the one previously, the other subsequently, took exception to the exercise of control over their subjects by the Sheikh of Bahrein, and requested the Political Agent to exercise the jurisdiction in question. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920,J a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The transfer to the Political Agent of jurisdiction over all foreigners did not improve relations between the Political Agent and Sheikh Isa, already none too good as a result of the interference by Government in a dispute between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud as to the duty to be levied on goods proceeding to Hasa, consequent on which Sheikh Isa had been compelled to accept 2 per cent, duty instead of the 5 per cent, which he desired, and in which he regarded Government as having favoured Ibn Saud at his expense.§ 11. This condition of affairs coincided with an internal crisis of a different character, which was destined to lead up to drastic intervention by His Majesty’s Government and the deposition of Sheikh Isa. The difficult situation produced by the Sheikh’s misgovernment, and its reactions on the position of Great Britain in the Islands, have already been mentioned. Captain Bray, in May 1919, expressed the opinion that there was in Bahrein a considerable feeling of hostility to His Majesty’s Government ‘due to religious, economical, personal and war reasons,” and no British party, and ffiat the activities of the American missionaries were anti-British. Major bh R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., a highly qualified officer with a distinguished record of service in Mesopotamia, who succeeded him as Political Agent, reported in January 1920that the political situation in Bahrein, while in no way dangerous, was wholly unsatisfactory ; that there was a strong and deep-seated anti-British sentiment of long standing, and that British prestige rested on fear and not on respect.

Daly, C.I.E.) in 11)21, and led by the end of that year^ deputation to ask for intervention to the Political Resident in the Pp • \ Gulf. Slan 12. The Resident accepted the position, and suggested to the Government of India that a possible solution might be that the Political Agent should be empowered to intervene in cases of gross oppression and give individual protection where necessary. 0 Earlier in 1921 Sheikh Abdulla had taken alarm at the rising discontent, and Sheikh Isa had appointed his heir, Skpikh Hamad, to take over control under his orders, but the masterful * wife of Sheikh Isa had prevented any advance. The attitude of the people became however, sufficiently alarming to lead Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Abdulla early in 1922 to take certain minor steps in the direction of reform, and the Government of India, who in January 1922 had stated that they were not prepared to consider drastic intervention until all local resources had been exhausted and intervention was imperative to secure the protection of foreigners and the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Islands, and who remained anxious to avoid interference if it could be avoided, informed the Resident in the light of this that while it was most undesirable that they should be drawn into interference between the Sheikh and his subjects, they were prepared to lend their moral support to an honest attempt by the Sheikh to put his scheme into force. They emphasised that nothing should be done to encourage the idea that reforms were being introduced by the Sheikh at the dictation of Government. • Id. The reforms, however, proved illusory ; the internal situation continued threatening ; the Foreign Office, who in March 1922 had urged the taking of immediate steps of reform, in view of the prejudicial effect on the position of His Majesty’s Government in Persia of “ the present highly unsatisfactory state of affairs in Bahrein,”t again represented the necessity for action, in the interests of the Shiah subjects of the Sheikhs, on 29th May 1922.J The Secretary of State for India referred the matter to the Government of India, and they 7 to the Resident in the Gulf. The Political Agent thereupon recommended a postponement of action, partly to enable developments to be watched, partly to appraise the importance of the interest in Bahrein affairs of Ibn Saud, and this recommendation was accepted; but by the end of 1922 the Political Resident was obliged to report that the state of affairs in Bahrein called for reform more urgently than ever, and that Government must be prepared to back up moral pressure by material force if the required reforms were to be carried through. 14. Finally, in April 1923,§ the Government of India, who recognised that if the status of Bahrein and our position in the Islands was brought before the League by Persia, “misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case,” recommended that if Sheikh Isa could not be persuaded to take the necessary steps himself, he should be deposed, his son Abdulla deported, and the required reforms carried out by 7 the Government of India, his Majesty’s Government approved action on these lines, and Sheikh Isa proving obdurate, he was deprived of his control on 26th May 1923, and g raI |J e[ an allowance,11 and his son, Sheikh Hamad, appointed to act for him a» his father’s fully empowered Agent.” It was found unnecessary to deport Sheikh Abdulla. Appeals by Sheikh Isa to the High Commissioner or Iraq and the Viceroy, culminating in an appeal in 1925 to the Secretary o State for India, were rejected. Cp. Pol. Res.

All these officials were, in fact’ appointed on the recommendation and with the approval of Government’ though they are the servants of the Sheikhs and formally appointed by them.’ 16. 1 he correspondence which has passed since 1923 between the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Gulf shows increasing- reluctance on the part of the former to assume full responsibility for the contiol of Bahiem, oi to do more than carry the Sheikh wholeheartedly with them in the path of refonn while avoiding the “ Westernisation ” of his State. It is understood that in pursuance of this policy they have had under consideration the diminution of the overt signs of British influence in Bahrein ; that the European Director of Customs has now been given a year s notice and will not he replaced ; that the European police officer may also be dispensed with, and that an ultimate concentration under a single competent . European, such as the present Financial Adviser, of direct responsibility for their Departments is in contemplation. IT- In the discussions between the Sheikhs and the Political Agent which took place consequent on the reassertion in December 1927 of the Persian claim to Bahrein, it is satisfactory to be able to record that while Sheikh Isa remained sensitive regarding the maintenance of his internal inde pendence, Sheikh Hamad, the de facto ruler, Sheikh Abdulla, and also Sheikh Salman, the eldest son of Sheikh Hamad, are stated by the Political Resident to have displayed anxiety, in their own interests, to admit to the full the protection of Great Britain. 18. The policy of His Majesty’s Government in Bahrein is one of the points for consideration by the present Sub-Committee, and on the decision on it must turn the decision on the degree of interference and control to be exercised over the internal administration.of the Islands. But it is pertinent to quote the remarks of the Political Resident in the Gulf, made though they were before the situation was modified by the reassertion of the Persian claim to suzerainty, in his Despatch* of 1st September 1927 : — “ We cannot lose Bahrein. But, notwithstanding our outwardly strong position in the Islands, a single serious quarrel with Sheikhs Isa and Hamad, a quarrel engineered by Ibn Sand on religious grounds, or through Persia on political grounds, and we should have to vacate our privileged position oi force ourselves on the principality in the face of the world against the wishes of its rulers.” P. 71/27, and Pol.

The Sheikh agreed in 1914 not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. The question of obtaining a concession was revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, wdio appeal originally to have raised it in 1918, in 1921. Negotiations on then &gt;e ia were undertaken with the Sheikh of Bahrein through the Political Resident, but agreement proved impracticable, and in the event a concession, gianting hu exclusive exploration licence for a period not exceeding two \ears, su flee to renewal by the Sheikh, acting on the advice of the Political Resident, tor certain further periods, w T as signed by the Sheikh of Bahrein (a so wi l ie approval of His Majesty’s Government) in favour of the Eastein an ^eneia Syndicate on 2nd December 1925.

His Majesty’s Government undertook in Article 11 of the same Convention not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr, or to annex it and in Article 14 that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries, while the Turkish Government accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyeh Island for fishing, and recognised the right of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. Owing to the outbreak of war, the agreement in question was never ratified; but the Turkish claim to Bahrein would seem to have disappeared with the disappearance of the Turkish Empire and the elimination of Turkey from the Persian Gulf, and no endeavour has been made to revive it since the end of the war. * Teh. tel. 95, 1908.

Despite the nine repudiations enumerated in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, the Persian claim was kept alive in the years 1908-14. Representations made by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to the Persian Government in 1908 in regard to the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah,-' produced the reply that instructions had been sent to Lingah to make reparation and do the man justice,” but that, as to the question of Bahrein, the Minister “ will admit that the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the Island is not a matter to be disputed.” Considerable subsequent discussion took place with the Persian Government, with a view to the withdrawal of this Note or the modification of its terms. In view of the fact that His Majesty’s Government considered it inopportune to raise the question of Bahrein in its general aspect, a somewhat gentler line was taken with the Persian Government than was perhaps altogether consistent with the attitude adopted before and since by His Majestys Government; and it was only after unsuccessful efforts to secure the substitution of a modified version that the Persian Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.f The Persian Foreign Office thereupon declared that, if the Note returning the objectionable communication could be withdrawn, the Persian Government would send in substitution for the latter an amended Note in the sense desired, adding that, if this arrangement was not accepted, they would be obliged to sen a strong reply to the British Note. The Minister remarked that this would have raised the general question of Bahrein, for which the moment was clearly inopportune, and that he had therefore accepted the P ro P ose fh arrangement. The amended Note was accepted, and the matter closed ' 1 a Note from His Majesty’s Minister dated the 13th May 1909, acknowledging receipt and reaffirming that His Majesty’s Government inamtame^ ^ British protection, and that the. regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia, the position that Bahrein and its inhabitants were under British protection, , would be guided entirely by their own views of the position shou &lt;- action of the Persian Government make representations necessary. 23. be fulfi the case the For severe! i |of avoio 24. coastal were vis habit o from Bj proposa from tlu on this inregar Bahrein hy the 1 nine ye into a U giving I 25. recognit Chiefs ; under n 20. 1 In the y that the Steam I s Bahrein They se hut on were gr this inc Persians or passe the ade regarde the Gov below.

There were no fresh developments of importance until after the war. In the year .1922 His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bandar Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingahg' at which port British India *,^6* loub? r 2787 / 22 ° Steam Navigation Company’s vessels put in from Bahrein, had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representations being made by the Minister at Tehran, instructions ( ^ ^ were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of sept. i 0 i 927 . this incident. In the same year, His Majesty’s Minister suggested that Persians going to Bahrein should be required to obtain British visas or passes, and should be turned back if they had not got them, a procedure the adoption of which was recommended by the Political Agent, who regarded it as feasible. It was subjected accordingly to examination by the Government of India and the Foreign Office, with the results shown below. In 1922 also the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire, while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, stated that his action was without prejudice to Peisian claims to Bahrein.')' 27. At about the same time a Press campaign for the return of Bahrein to Persia and for its direct representation in the Majlis was. started m the Persian papers. This discussion culminated in a motion in the Majlis to give Bahrein the right to return a Member, a demand for the immec late discussion of which was rejected, but which was referred to a Commission , 17 for report.t His Majesty’s Government, in the light ot this development, + y23 e “• decided that it was desirable to instruct the Minister at fehran to address a formal Note to the Persian Government, in terms similar to those emp ov ec in 1906, and considered the question of asking the Admiralty to despatch a vessel to show the Flag in the neighbourhood of Bahrein. Ihe Govemmen of India concurred in the action proposed, and expressed the view that, it a Note was presented, the withdrawal of passport measures shou d be included remarking (doubtless with the proposals on the subject ot the Mimstei a Tehran in mind) that, whether a Note was presented or not, they saw no objection to retaliatorv measures requiring visitois to . a lem 0 a on a British visa.§ They added, however, that the critical internal situation m |^^«May29 Persia made it doubtful whether the present moment was oppoitune 01 action.

No further steps were taken until September 1923, when the Persian Government were informed that the Island was now a British Protectorate and that His Majesty s Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status—a declaration met by a statement bv the Persian Minister h roreign Affairs that the Government of which he was a memher had m intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia This diil not prevent the Minister for Foreign Affairs from again raising the question in the following month in a conversation in the course of which Sir Percy Loraine tentatively suggested, in his personal capacity, the possibility of putting the matter to arbitration, a suggestion for makino- which he was sharply rebuked by the Foreign Office, and from which nothing resulted. . Between 1928 and 1927 there was a lull, and no point of real importance arose. His Majesty’s Government were reluctant to face the question of the status of Bahrein, and in consequence adopted in general an accommodating attitude so far as possible on minor questions Thus on the vexed question of the use by Bahreinis of Persian passports and travelling passes (llm-o-Khabar), agreement was reached in 1925** that ahrein subjects should not be subjected to the new' Persian passport regulations, the production of an Um-o-Khabar sufficing, and His Majesty’s Loveinment, despite the apparent concession of principle involved in the recognition of the Ilm-o-Khabar, decided in 1927 tacitly to acquiesce in this — paitiy on the ground that the recognition of these documents could be ignoied, since they were also being issued by Persia in the case of Koweit, tlie, status of wdiich wms not in dispute to let the question of independent Bahreini passports lie; and to allow' the matter generally to rest unless lev * ve ^ By Persian action.I There were no developments until June- p It'’ ) v ^ ei1 refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to visa the pass of a ahiemi an incident now r under examination—again raised the question.jt Tel. from Pol. Res. to S. of S. for I., Sept. 18 1928, P. 5100. o l. In September 1928, the Political Resident, on learning that a Persian lesiding at Bahrein was endorsing Persian Ilm-o-Khabar for Persians for the leturn journey to Persia, instructed the Political Agent to tell the k.heikh to issue orders that no one bearing such documents would be allowed to land, and to inform the offender who was issuing endorsements that he wms usurping the powers of a Government official, wdiich could be performed onh with the consent of the Sheikh, and that he would be requested to leave the island unless he desisted. The vigorous reassertion of the Persian claim to Bahrein dealt with below renders it desirable to keep a vigilant watch for any action which might be construed or represented by Persia as an admission ol their claim to suzerainty over Bahrein, and while it is not clear how persons carrying Ilm-o-Khabar are to be identified on &lt;m( ling, Sir Lionel Haworth’s action is not inopportune at a time when SoptmV, !&gt;. 5093 28 f ° r l '’ V er f are Bidications of an inclination on the part of Persia to assert a shadowy claim to suzerainty over the States of the Arab littoral by requiring t at their nationals shall take out Persian passports or travelling passes. o2. It may be mentioned at this point that the Belgian Administrator- General of the Persian Customs stated early in 1928 that “about four years ago he had been taken to task by the Government of the day for imposing customs duties on goods imported from Bahrein to Persia ; and that he ha c replied that customs dues had ahvays been so levied . . . and that befoie- f928 el i&gt; D 8 e 79 P /28 8,Jan - 27 ^ C0llld Be abandoned . . . the Persian Government would have to institute a customs control at Bahrein itself.Reassertion of Persian Claim and Appeal to League, 1927. 33. The deposition of Sheikh Isa by His Majesty’s Government in 1923, and the subsequent increase in the degree of active British influence, ' emphasised the position publicly taken in Bahrein by His Majesty’s f Government, but the Persian claim was not again actively reasserted until the text of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded with Ibn Saud on 9|)th May 1927, in which Bahrein was referred to as having “special Treaty relations” with His Majesty’s Government, provoked a strong protest by Persia, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations with a request for circulation.|t The Persian protest was based tt Teh. Desp. to f.o. 577, largely on an alleged recognition of Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in a Nov - 25,5,2/ - Note dated 29th April 1869, from the Earl of Clarendon, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A reasoned reply to the Persian Note, which (after a brief delay in the hope that an arrangement might be reached with Persia) was equally communicated to, and circulated by, the League, was despatched by His Majesty’s Government on 18th January 1928. Suffice it to say that His Majesty’s Government, while avoiding any delinite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis, again repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms. 34. The Government of India, who but for the Persian protest would have inclined to favour a proposal of the Political Resident, under consideration at the time of its receipt, that His Majesty’s Government should set the seal on their position in Bahrein by a formal treaty of protection, provided that this was not precluded by wider considerations of foreign policy, recognised the tactical objections to such action in face of Persia s appeal to the League.§ They commended, in the circumstances, a proposal by Sir L. Haworth that the Sheikhs should be apprised of Persia s claim and encouraged to give a power of attorney to His Majesty s Government to defend their independence at Geneva, and if possible state their dependence on our protection. This latter proposal was approved by His Majesty s Government.! on the understanding that no pressure of any kind should be brought to bear on the Sheikh to secure the documents. His Majesty s Government added that, in their view, the desirability of stressing the dependence on our protection ” of the Sheikhs was doubtful, and suggested that the point could better be disposed of by reference to the special treaty relations o t re Sheikhs with His Majesty’s Government. § Viceroy’s tel., Dec. 29 1927, P. 5907. || Tel. from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, 181.

Under the Treaty concluded with His Majesty’s Government on -Gih December 1915, Ibn Sand undertook, “as liis Fathers did before him, to refrain from ail aggression on or interference with the territories of . . . Bahrein . . During the war he established a commercial forwarding agency in Bahrein (the Qusaibi) and began to take some interest at Bahrein ; in 1919 the Political Agent found it necessary to bring pressure to bear on Sheikh Isa to secure an equitable settlement of a dispute which had arisen owing to the imposition by the Sheikh of customs duties on goods passing through Bahrein in transit to Hasa and Nejd ; at the end of .July 1920 the Political Adviser, Bahrein, reported that Sheikh Salim of Kovveit had recently been in touch wdth Sheikh Isa, it was suggested with a view to securing his adherence to the movement against Ibn Saud which he wms then fomenting—though nothing appears to have come of this; while in 1922 Ibn Saud encouraged the recalcitrant Dowasir Bahrein tribe by offering them sanctuary in Hasa, an offer accepted on the abandonment of Bahrein by the tribe alter the deposition of Sheikh Isa in 1923.+ At the moment of the deposition of the Sheikh (April 1923) Ibn Sand’s agent had achieved an objectionable prominence in the Nejdi-Persian rioting which took place at Bahrein ; and Jlis Majesty’s Government finally approved a proposal by the Political Resident that he should be removed from Bahrein by being sent to Ibn Saud with a letter complaining of his conduct, requesting the Sultan to deal wdth the case, and asking that His Highness, before sending another Agent to Bahrein, should arrange to secure the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government in his choice.

E.—Summary. 40. Internally, the last 20 years have seen the consolidation of British influence in Bahrein. The Sheikh has agreed to grant neither oil nor pearling concessions without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government- jurisdiction over foreigners in the islands has passed from' the Ruler to the Political Agent; internal misrule has been checked by the deposition of Sheikh Isa, the substitution of Sheikh Hamad, and the provision for the new Sheikh of competent and disinterested European advisers under his orders. 41. Externally, the claim to suzeraintv of Turkey has lapsed. The claims of Persia have constantly been reasserted, and as constantly repudiated by His Majesty’s Government, over the period now in question. They are at the moment under argument, and have acquired a new importance by their reference to the League of Nations. Present indications are that Persia is likely to press them, and the desirability, in the interests of the Sheikhs, who have appointed His Majesty’s Government their agents in the matter, and on whom a compromise with Persia on the basis of the status quo would, according to the Political Resident, have a very unsettling effect of securing a decision which will finally dispose of them inter nationally, is for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. The rise of Ibn Saud is, however, the development most pregnant with possibility in the external relations of Bahrein. The King of the Hejaz and Nejd has not so far actively interested himself in the islands ; and the fact that the power which he has built up may not survive his death cannot be ignored. But, on the assumption of the survival of the existing state of things in Nejd, the present Memorandum (para. 39) makes the suggestion that it is Ibn Sand and the Wahabi movement, rather than Persia, that represent the real danger from a practical standpoint, and that were His Majesty’s Government for any reason to abandon their present position in Bahrein, Ibn Saud would, as matters stand, be their natural successor. Position in Bahrein of His Majesty’s Government. 42. While, however, His Majesty’s Government, as stated above, have over the past 20 years established &lt;xde facto control of the Islands of Bahrein, de jure their position is no stronger than before. At the same time, t le importance of establishing that position on a stable basis has ven gieat } increased since 1908. Erom the naval standpoint, Bahrein, although it la* been suggested, as a pis oiler, as a naval base or a coaling c epot, las t e •disadvantage of unhealthy climate and relative remoteness from t e exi 0 the Gulf and so from the probable scene of naval operations in the event of war.- The Air Ministry! regard it, however, as of great potential importance from the standpoint of British air interests-—not on y c cause o its geographical position outlie route to India, but because the isolation °f the islands from the mainland, and the long-established in ap 9 ce M 1 , 1( , m of His Majesty’s Government render them less likely to e 18 nl e )y anti-British rumours than other places on the.

On the assumption, then, that Imperial considerations our r,l• to the Sheikh apart, make it desirable for Ills Majesty’s Govermim t'T maintain and consolidate their position in Bahrein, the question arises ,f how this is to he achieved. The matter is one which call,; f,,, , handling On the one hand. Persia has appealed to the League on the Council of which she is now represented, and there is a possibility ’that sh» may endeavour to make a compromise on Bahrein a condition 'precedent to agreement with His Majesty’s Government on other Gulf questions ’ 0 the other hand, it appears that a compromise, even on the basis of the maintenance of the statu, quo, would have a definitely unsettling effect on the Sheikhs, who are suspicious that His Majesty’s Government mav use them as pawns to secure concessions from Persia of value to Great Britain only ■ that a decision which will definitely dispose internationally of the Persian claim is therefore desirable : and that, while the deposed Sheikh Isa remains sensitive regarding the maintenance of internal independence, the de facto ruler, his heir, and his brother, are anxious, in the face of Persian claims to admit to the full the protection of Great Britain. It mav perhaps be assumed that if the Persian claim could he disposed of before His Majesty’s Government had finally consolidated their position, much stronger opposition to such consolidation might bo expected from the ruling family, and this appears to make it desirable to seize the present opportunity to establish the British position once for all. . 44 * The simplest method of at once asserting internationally the British view of the status of Bahrein and establishing the position in the islands el f 18 Majesty’s Government vis-d-vis the Sheikh, would probablv on the whole be the conclusion of a formal treaty of protect,ion, a course under consideration in India (see para. 34 above) at the time of the reassert ion of t le i ersian claim last year. Had Persia been prepared to abandon her claim m ( e etence to His Majesty’s Government, the Treaty with Bahrein could lay' ymi concluded simultaneously with its abandonment. But as she is undoubtedly not prepared to compromise, such a treaty could only be com 11 ded in the face of Persian protests to the League and elsewhere, am t ic wider considerations of international policy involved in its com usion would call for close examination before a decision is taken regarding it. _ An alternative method of solution might be arbitration, to which various objections are obvious. . - F, T,M Points . re * erre( l 1° m connection with Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. , e .

I wish, however, to stress the following points (u) In 1S6J ve had installed Shaikh Isa as ruler of the islands, and it Avas entnelv due to om support that he had been able to keep his position. From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions, but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration. From 1901, with the appointment of a British Political Agent to Bahrain after the visit of Lord Curzon, our interest in internal matters increased, and we continued to press Shaikh Isa with good advice. He, however, seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained. In 1904, following on riots in which Persians and a German were concerned, and in which Shaikh Isa was first supine and then obstructive, the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, advocated vigorous measures against him, as he was “only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbearance.” The most important results of our intervention were the abolition of Sh ukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of Hie leader of the anti-Persian riots (who was Shaikh Isa’s oavu nephew), and the assumption by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Resident. In this case the impossibility of obtaining justice for Shiahs from the Sunni Qadhis was brought to notice. In connection with these events Major Cox reported :— “ I do not see how we can expect anything but periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable endeavours to carry on the government of the islands through the rule of a chief who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the (Qualifications necessaiy ioi the maintenance of order, the security of persons and of trade. favour of stronger measures, but His Majesty s the amelioration of the internal government v52S (b) (d) He was accordingly in Government decided that (e) In Hirtzel showed how the P. 5649/29. in the matter of (/) should be sought by indirect and pacific means. n 1919 Shaikh Abdulla’s interview with Sir Arthur Ruler chafed against the interference of the Political Agent in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners and appointments to the Bench ol Magistrates. Although the Political Agent possessed these powers, he was powerless to stop misrule. . „ which the deposition of Shaikh Isa in 1923 The gross oppression from rescued the people—especially the Baharanah, and the opening that this fially the Persians and the Wahabis. The oppression is set out in the extracts from Major Daly’s report forwarded to Government under Colonel Trevor’s letter. No. 23 S„ dated 8th January (g) to Government 1922.

It means administering the islands for rP sake of the Chief of the tribes, exploiting the people for the rulers a 1 treating the Shiahs as a people of an unprivileged class. (/) Government, and not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threat* instead of advice. 8 (}) Shaikh Hamad is a pleasant man but weak, and it is idle to pretend lie and his brothers would not backslide. To relax too much means to go througl the same grind as we have come. ® 3. Throughout the history of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interference displayed by the Government of India is apparent. In 1904 they decided “ to pursue a cautious policy.” Later, the Political Agent was to “seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means, and by the confidence and trust of the Shaikh.’ * ® In 1922 they “did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Shaikh and his people.” “Government are not prepared to act until they are satisfied all local resources are exhausted.” Yet it was this Government, who were so obviously and sincerely anxious to avoid interference, which finally had to order the Political Resident to take the steps which led to the deposition of the Ruler. They never, however, forgot their original policy and within a couple of mouths are again warning the Political Agent to lie on his guard against beiug tempted to interfere too much, or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. It is obvious that Government did their very best to avoid the action of 1923; but it was forced on them by the gross tyranny of the A1 Khalifa, whom Shaikh Isa made no attempt to restrain, and by the pressure of the London Foreign Office, fearful of the reactiou in Persia of the oppression of a Shiah population, and because “ misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case if the status of Bahrain and our position in the Islands was brought before the League of Nations.” 4. The point to remember now is that Shaikh Isa, the Ruler, was not bad natnred at heart. Although obstinate in rejecting all advice from the Political Agents as derogatory to his position as an independent ruler, he was easy-going and had a strong dislike for interfering with the actions of inenil&gt;ers of his family even when these took the form of gross tyranny. The family—the Al Khalifa—were uneducated ravages with a veneer of town manners. The outlook of Shaikh Isa and his family was as is described in para 2 (h) above. Xow Shaikh Hamad is extremely amiable, with a constitutional disinclination to take strong measures on any subject. Even as a judge, his inclination is to acquit an obvious criminal and himself to pay a fine imposed. Such a man—except in the fact that he is younger and has seen changes taking place around him and that he is. in consequence, less conservative—is not to be differentiated from his father, dust as his father permitted oppression, but did not actnely oppress, so would Hamad act. \\ ith the exception of Shaikh Khalid, all the old oppressors are still alive and willing to resume their former ways if not repressed. Shaikh Hamad would certainly not repress them if deprived of active ^-h support and direction. To this day his weakness in any matter connected witn the Al Khalifa is pathetic. In ordinary matters also, in spite of the presence in xuiram of a British adviser, he truckles to any show of force. In May of this year he reversed a decision he had made the previous day regarding the amount of advance to diver&gt; because a mob of 20) unarmed men made a clamour in his Majlis. It is cenajnh better that Shaikh Hamad should govern and make mistakes than that we s on la govern and make none, but a man of his type, who will not incur the odium governing, must have an adviser. If the European adviser were removed, nam Hamad would surely fall under the influence of some intriguing Syrian or gyptian w ho *'Ould, for a consideration, play into the hands of Persia or Xajd. , defencelessness of the Bahrain Government in the face of gang robberies v\ lie ei to the institution of the Indian armed police. These police had to be toreign as the Bahrain Arab was averse from wearing uniform, had an objection to an occupation unconnected with boats, and disliked binding bimself to fixed pen. &gt; o dim. Ihe armed police are still necessary, but it mav be possible to make tuem less obstrasively foreign by substituting Sudanese for Indians, directly the contract of the latter expires at the beginning of 1931. Owing to the large number oi oiacks descended from slaves domiciled in the islands, the Sudanese would melt into the landscape in a way the Indians fail to do. Mr. Belgrave, the present adviser ^ ama ^j has experience of Sudanese, having served with them in Eg?T* e war. I would have recommended that the present European Commandant(Sz&amp;J t 1 I 1 !dTan iScemrrTheen^of ToT f^e^ho? 6 ^ Baln-am may shortly have to submit to an influx’of American aLfo her foreign dr,Hers and o,l workers, 1 do not thmk it advisable to dispense with th^eiwiees of“ European Commandant of Pohce unless and until we are satisfied that the threatened invasion by the chance of employment. 5. ! turn now to the Customs Department. This was an old bone of contention between bhaikh Isa and the (jovernment of India. It was Colonel Mead who first suggested bringing it under control, under the mistaken assumption that Shaikh Isa was really as poor as he pretended when the pretence suited him. In any ease, the question of the Customs Department came for a time to be looked upon as a trial of strength between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. I he old system was to farm out the Customs to a Hindu contractor and, as was only to be expected, the revenue accruing to the Slate was much less than it should have been. I his^ loss was estimated at one lakh of rupees a year, but judging from the yield of the Customs since it has been put under conscientious European control, it must have been considerably more. Customs is the main source of revenue to the State and brought in during the past year Rs. 11,24,079, out of a total of Rs. 12,15,694. The Director of Customs is not only in charge of the department from which he takes his name, but he is also Port Officer and controls the passports, registration of boats, and various minor revenue departments. Owing to the lack of natives with sufficient education and honesty to take charge of the various departments, a foreigner must be appointed to control them. At present the head is a European. Is anything to be gained by substituting an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraqian ? To the untrained eye of an Englishman, an Egyptian might look more indigenous than an Englishman, but to a resident of the Gulf lie would still be a foreigner. Hie Customs is not a political department, and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance; but in a small nation like Bahrain the personal it} 7, of the man who collects 90 per cent, of the revenues must count for something. As in the case of the Adviser, why jettison a European, who can be trusted, in order to replace him by some foreign Oriental about whose integrity and whose intrigues one can never he sure ? 0. Captain Prior, the present Political Agent at Bahrain, summed up the situation very well in one of his reports to me, when he stated that Mr. de Greniei collects the revenues of the State and Mr. Belgrave conserves them. If the efficient collectoi and conserve!’ are removed, what is to happen to a State which has become accustomed to a far higher rate of public expenditure than ever before in its history ? ^ot only have the claims of the idle and ever increasing Al Khalifa been generously met, but for the first time Bahrain has been administered for the good of its people, and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, discontent is sure to return. If the European Adviser were removed his place would be taken by an Arab from Bahrain—almost certainly one of the Al Khalifa. A\ ith the exception of Shaikh Abdulla there is at the moment not a single member of the Al knalita ht either bv character or education to fill the post. Bahrain m the present day is not the pearl trade oi which it is toe ceuue, it ‘y- + ~ , -V M attracted to itself a number of foreigners, who, are m con ac vjh qc imi nisi ration* Thanks to the interest taken bv the Government of India m IJ-o, its adminisirat oi, inanks to tne i ic .ufn.iWion of the Gulf.

(a) Before and during the war Bahrain was notorious for its unhealthy climate- the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside world. A demand for greater cleanliness arose, and in spite of the opposition of Shaikh Isa, the demand, backed by \J±_ 11 A xio. Cl 1AC4A A AAvy n » * a v / vy c/iiVy J I 1 O UJ. W Jllvii cllG partly nominated by the Ruler and partly elected—are presided over by Shaikh Hamad’s brother. The Political Agent and the Adviser attend the meetings, but take little part in the proceedings unless asked for guidance. In 1920 a considerable part of the population looked upon the Manama municipality as an objectionable foreign innovation, but it is now recognised as a valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipality was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand, without consulting the Political Agent. People recognise that if the municipalities were abolished filth and plague would return. The benefit derived from the presence’at municipal meetings of the Political Agent and the Adviser, who have no vote, is to lend a certain decorum to the proceedings, which otherwise have a tendency to become pandemonium. They do not interfere unduly, and their complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affairs would be unpopular. (b), (c) and (d) have already been treated in paras. 4 and 5 above. (e) Major Daly’s report on the state of affairs in 1921 shows the conditions from which Bahrain was rescued. These conditions were largely due to the lack of any Court of Law which could deal efficiently with offenders. The minor members of the Khalifa family terrorised the people just as they wished. The Qadhis were corrupt or impotent. A good Court of Law was a crying need, but the difficulty was to find a suitable magistrate. At first the Political Agent (Major Daly) sat as adviser to the local magistrate, but with the arrival of Mr. Belgrave he resigned his position to the latter. At present there are the following Courts functioning in Bahrain :— (1) ihe Joint Court, on which the Ruler and the Political Agent sit to hear cases, civil and criminal, involving foreign and Bahrain subjects in which the latter are defendants. There is also a small Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant and a minor x\l Khalifa. (2) The Political Agent’s Court, for the trial of all cases in which foreigners are concerned. (3) The Court of Shaikh Sulairnan, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, assisted and advised by Mr. Belgrave, for the trial of Bahrain subjects. (4) Ihe Small Cause Court, conducted by a minor member of the A1 Khalifa. In the first case all disputes are referred to one or other of these Courts. They usually deal themselves with criminal cases, though a considerable number are referred to the Qadhis for settlement by the taking of oath. Civil cases, almost without exception, are referred to the Qadhis, the Majlis al Urfi or the Salifah Court for opinion. 'Judgment usually follows the opinion. The indigenous Courts are :— (a) The Court of the Qadhis—Sunni or Shiah as the case may be. (b) The Majlis al Urfi. (c) The Salifah or Diving Court. The Qadhis are the usual Islamic Courts having jurisdiction in all personal matters, divorces, inheritances, &amp;c. They often advise in criminal matters, but their peculiar aws of evidence and the sharp differences between Shiah and Sunni make it impossible to hand criminal justice completely over to them. The Majlis al Urfi is the Court dealing with the customary law of trade. R 18 commercial Court and all disputed commercial cases are referred to it. There aie0 fO members.

The Salifah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating to diving. Before 1023 this Court consisted of one venal old man, whose decisions were a disgrace to the State. Xow, except for a bias against foreigners, it functions satisfactorily. From this description it will be seen that except in the Court of the Political Agent- established under the Order in Council—a member of the Al Khalifa is associated with all the proceedings of justice. Even the Political Agent’s Court refers many matters for native opinion and advice. As already stated, the Al Khalifa are uneducated and ignorant, and it would be impossible for them to manage affairs without the support given them by the Political Agent or the Adviser. Both Shaikh Hamad—-when he can be aroused to interest him self—and his son, Sulaiman, on all occasions, are excellent in dealing with cases demanding local knowledge; but as they themselves confess, they would not pass sentences of death or take action against prominent men without the support of their advisers. In the course of time Shaikh Sulaiman may get sufficient courage to stand on his own feet. A successor will be trained to take his place when he succeeds his father in the rulership or gets tired of his magisterial work. (f) Before 1923 the divers were wholly in the hands of their nakhudas and the merchants, who worked through the single venal member of the Salifah. Now a proper system of accounts has been established and, thanks to the supervision of the Courts over the Salifah, the divers have very little cause for complaint. Their lot, from being the worst, has become the best in the Gulf. f G ) Bahrain, in addition to town sites, has on extensive area under gardens. It was found that Shaikh Isa, as Lord of the Soil, in his happy-go-lucky way, had frequently sold or gifted the same area to two or even three different persons. Ihe result was innumerable disputes, which could only be terminated by caieful enquir} followed by an accurate survey. A survey of all towns and of certain village aieas At first the survey of villages was resented, as people could not understand the reason for it, but now they have come to realise its benefits Those villages which have not hitherto been surveyed, owing to paucity of staff, have begun to demand that a survey should be carried out immediately.

(j) Waqfs are eminently a religious matter in which it behoves fureicr especially non-Muslims, to walk very warily. ° ers ’ Just before his departure, Major Daly, moved by certain bad scandals attem t i to take action to reform the Waqfs, but his successor decided it would be* best nott a interfere and to trust to the public opinion that was being stirred by the liberal rnp ? ' Jr of the State. The policy of non-interference appears to be justifying itself. Recentf' the Shiahs themselves appointed a committee which took over their Waqfs from the Qadhi. If the Sunnis follow suit, large sums now pocketed by the Qadhis mav become available for primary education. 8. I have examined the present conduct of affairs in Bahrain and 1 see nothing that can be profitably altered at the present moment. ^ Innovations which met with opposition in 1928 are now accepted as the ordinary scheme of things; and the Bahrain merchants look forward to the development of air communication under British auspices. The unpopularity of the British Government which was worked up in the Arabic and other Press, has now disappeared and their good works are appreciated. In time the good works and the tyranny from which the British rescued Bahrain, and especially the Shiah Baharanah,'will be foro-otten and only the privileged position of the British occupying the chief posts will be noticed. To avoid the odium which would fall on Britain, in course of time, from this cause, it is necessary to educate natives of Bahrain to take the place of the British officials. 9. Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful understudy for Mr. de Grenier offers in Abdnlla bin Shaikh Ibrahim al Khalifa—at present a third- year student at the American University in Beirut. He has industry, but unfortunately no great aptitude for arithmetic. Captain Prior thinks, however, that when he has compfeted his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training in the Customs Department at Bombay or Karachi, before being appointed to the Bahrain Customs with a view eventually to taking over charge. 1 consider Captain Prior’s proposal very sound and recommend it for adoption. If Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim’s indifferent arithmetic is a bar to the efficient performance of his duties, one of his younger cousins—Shaikh Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or Shaikh Hamad bin Shaikh Abdulla, nephews of the present Deputy Ruler who are first-year students, might later be selected for training. 10. There remains the question of a successor to the Adviser. Although Government do not appear to desire the immediate removal of Mr. Belgrave, this question must be considered. Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy Ruler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain Prior, in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his own feet, has stated truly: “ So long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem, get shooting and hawking, and enough money to support him with a little pomp and pride of place, he does not mind what happens to Bahrain.” Such a man must have an adviser on whom he can lean. . His natural adviser is his eldest son, Sulaiman, age about 85, who will probably succeed him Sulaiman is not without promise; he is intelligent and is gaining valuable experience on the magisterial bench, but he is uneducated and in some ways little removed from a Bedu. 1 he onh really capable member of the Al Khalifa family is Shaikh Hamads biothei, Abdulla, who is self-educated, but is unfortunately distrusted by the people owing to his previous evil record. Of Shaikh Hamad s sons the one who shows most promise is Shaikh Mubarak, the fourth son. In my letter No. 86b S. of 21st August 1929 I have already lecommended that a good tutor should be obtained for him. It is hoped that in due ( ouise lie may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a iclp hist to his father and then to his brother, Sulaiman, who has no son to follow a tei inn, and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now falling to the European Adviser.. 11. ^ ith the spread of education it should be possible to conduct the adminb trauon of Bahrain without any British interference in internal affairs in a manner w uc i vw not shame us. At present, owing to the weakness of the Deputy h u 61 and the Jack of men of suitable character, this is impossible.8 f P d t S c S o « Is f p s H J e t a n of the European Commandant of Police be dispensed with at the termination of ] ‘ present contract, but that the services of the Adviser and the Director of Customs D retained until suitable Arab substitutes have been trained to take their place. ° 1G. Shaikh Hamad .has already extended the term of the Advisor’s contract till March 1934. It will probably be necessary to grant him at least two further quaternary extensions. It is diflicult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Mr. de Grenier* but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. 17. As the coming of an oil company is still problematical, I have not discussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itself westernise the islands in possibly an unfortunate way, and I presume there would have to be a British element in the administration to counteract its effects. 18. It appears from para. 2 of your letter under reply that Government is- purturbed at the danger that, with the example of Bahrain before their eves the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Bin Sami. It is true that the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are extremely jealous of anv British encroachment on their independence, just as Shaikh Isa was before his forced relinquishment of ipower. They oppose any concession to the European. 1 do not however, ascribe this attitude wholly to the events in Bahrain, it is due far more to the natural exclusiveness of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from Aden as well as from Mecca. No attempt had been made to westernise Bahrain when the Hyacinth episode of 1911 occurred. It is from this incident and the comparative immunity from evil consequences enjoyed by the people of Dubai that I date the increasingly independent attitude of the Trucial Shaikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident rnished a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang his objections the admission of Europeans to the coast. His statement was true in 1911 and is cannot be blamed for •opeans but the British policy in Bahrain obviously P. 5040/20. furnished to true to this day this. If we interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its Shaikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough from which we have rescued it, then indeed will we have forfeited Arab respect and cleared the way for Bin Saud. In 1920, Major Dickson reported : “ Our position in the island is founded on fear and not respect.” Now it is founded on respect. The Trucial Chiefs now see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain and even its Chiefs. We cannot expect them immediately to call in British advisers on their own account, but in time their aversion from contact with the European may be overcome through the influence of a civilised Bahrain. It will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. If it suits Bin Sand, he will intrigue in Oman as his fathers did before him. I he attitude of the Shaikhs of the coast will be guided by self-interest as it. has ever been. If we have consistently and with success espoused their cause against Persia and Najd they will look to us for support. If we have shown no great energy in supporting their case against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily succumb to Najd intrigue. If Bin Saud emerges victorious from his present troubles, it is possible that he will seek to extend his influence on the coast and cause us trouble as Peza Shah has in Persia ; but I do not see how the situation in Bahrain will affect the issue. All Arabs criticised our action in Bahrain when the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement. The chastisement was sahitar) and Shaikh Isa s supporters have accepted the present regime, which is not unduh westernised. I have shown some ways in which the outward form may be modified while retaining the spirit, but 1 do not advise the jettisoning of useful European official noi the taking of any steps other than those I have indicated.

Ibn Baud’s comiauxiication was somewhat bluntly worded, and it will be seen that Bhaikh iiaaad’s reply was equally blunt. ^ g regards the high handed acts ol one (^usaibi family at Bahrain, there is a possibility that their in- -fluence with King Ibn Gaud may be declining. They lu ve hitherto enjoyed customs exemption on all goods emported by them into Hnsa. Recently however Ibn Baud has sent a customs inspector to Hasa and I am told that he tes m- -formed the ^usaibis that they can no lon 0 er be allowed to import goods without payment of customs duty and that if the King wishes kh® to accord them any concession it must take the form of a definite rebate or refund of customs duty to be granted ordinary way. to them after they have paid duty in the I saw Abdul Kahman Q,usaibi in bahrein andand he openly expressed to me his dislike of the Syrian officials employed by the King, and it was evident that there was no love lost between them.

I have the honour to bring to your notice instances of the continued aggression of the King of the Hejaz and his agents, the ftusaibis, an aggression which, if not checked, will have a serious effect on our position in Bahrain, 2. It will he remembered that during the summer Ihn Jiluwi, the Amir of Hasa, had written to Shaikh Hamad (and to me) in a somewhat peremptory fashion demanding the surrender of certain persons whom he considered to he of Nejd nationality, and he also sent men to fetch them, an act which was much resented hy the Ruling family. Actually the Shaikh refused to admit that they were other than Bahrain subjects, in fact they were Dowasir who had lived here for many years, though not without trading connections on the mainland, and the men were not returned. I took advantage of the opportunity to point out to Ihn Jiluwi that Ihn Saud had himself requested that the pr&amp;ct- -ice of surrendering persons should cease, and that it was at his request that we had ceased asking mainland mirs to send men to Bahrain. 3. While I was in Karachi a theft occurred on a dhow in Bahrain harbour, and both the accused and the nakhoda were Hasawis. Apparently, considering a conviction unlikely, the Kakhuda went to Hasa and informed Ibn Jiluwi of the occurrence, and he immediately wrote to Shaikh Hamad telling him to have the men sent to Hasa for trial. The case was referred to me and I gave instructions that the men were on no account to be sent to iiaaa but that they were to be dealt with according to law at Bahrain. 4. On ay return here I found that when a prominent merchant, Mohammed Yateem, recently ran over a Nejdl in his2 sis! his car he was at once summoned by the qusaibis, who severely reprimanded him for having injured a subject of H iS iiajesty King Ion 3aud. He was later prosecuted by the police but tneir action caused much comment. 5# a few days before I arrived, as a result ol a squa^ule at a well, some servants of the Qusaibis at xa . ^fa a armed with rifles assaulted a servant of Shaikh : 1 ashid, the xame son of the Huler’s orother, Shaikh Muhamm- -ad, and, tying him up with a rope, took him to the ^usaiDis’ house and confined him there. The Rafa’a Arabs toux this as an insult to the A1 Khilifa and a riot nearly ensued, out the Imam of the mosque managed to calm them, and when Abdul Aziz q,usaibi came to the house at night the man was released. 6. As a result of pressure by Shaikh Huhammad, Shaikh Hamad ordered the heir-apparent to go and tell the ^usaibis that they must apologise and he conveyed a message to this effect to Hassan ;useibi. Ho notice, however, was taken of this, and finally Shaikh Rashid and Shaikh Muhammad had the ?il± police set in motion and a case registered. The case was brought up before me but, at the last moment, Shaikh Rashid came and said that the Qusaibis had been to see the '?uler. and thr^t he had asked Shaikh Muhammad to get his son to stop the case prodeeding. Ke himself, he said, would not on any account have allowed them to esc&amp;pfc scot free, but he was unable to stand against the expressed wish of the Ruler. I therefore allowed the case to be compromised, and the mettter was settled. 7. 1 did not address the i^usaibis or take any action against them in any instance although their action in both the last two mentioned cases was intolerable. Had I called them to account they would have said in the firs': instance that the man was a friend or servant of theirs and that they intervened in a friendly spirit, and in the second, thatthat t:.ey had no knowledge of what had happened and had hastened to release the man when they discovered what had been done. I do not wish to quarrel with them unless they give me an unmistakeahle casus iDelli, but if I see further signs of their interference I shall take the cotter up. 8. fhe last instance is much more serious, and affects the King himself. when I arrived 1 found that he had recently sent Shaikh Hamad two letters. One was complimentary and signed and the other, which was attached to it and was in the same handwriting, was not signed and, as you will see, most objectionable in tone. I have carefully checked the translation and it gives an accurate interpretation of the original. -’he Ruler had not replied to it pending my return, and when I got an opportun- -ity of discussing it with him, in the presence of Shaikh / Abdullah and the heir-apparent, Shaikh Salman, I could clearly see that they were much incensed by it. 9 # 'What does he mean by saying that his people pay heavy taxes' he said 'they pay nothing hut the 5% customs which our people pay, and they are far more heavily taxed in their own country. Her have I ever heard of any of them complaining of ill treatment. In fact they flee from oppression in their own country and come here for juatice which they cannot get from him. Let them return to Hasa if they prefer it.' He then referred to the thinly veiled reference to the re-export concession and said, as he has done before, but this time in far more definite language, that the former reduction from 5/, to 2, had ,een forced on them and that this concession made Ibn Saud greedy to pay nothing at all. 'Let him use another port if he cannot pay 3* for our expenses here' he said. 10. I raised the question of a reply and ■uggesU.a that he should await your arrival before sending it. Ihi. he4 he was loath to do, as he said the letter had oeen some time awaiting a reply ana to delay farther would sugg- -est that he could not or would not meet the charges con- -tained in it. It was therefore aecided that he should reply in similar style, s complimentary letter dated and signed and an unsealed attachment which should ask in the same ehrupt language as the King had used, what exactly he referred to when he spoke of heav^ taxation and ill-treat- -ment of his subjects. 11. This ha# been done and 1 have just received his letter and enclose a copy of it. In its way, it is an excellent reply and will have the support of all his &amp;xx brothers. Technically the reply should have been made through Bush!re but in the circumstances it seemed best to follow the mode employed, especially as the King had himself chosen it. I should add that the reference to the persona *whc would protect his interests' mentioned in the Kind's letter are assumed by the Shaikh to refer to His Majesty’s Jovernnent. He laughed when he re?d this and said ' /ell, they are my friends too; I have nothing to fear from the High Government.' 12. I have dealt with the matter in some haste, but it seemed important that I should place you in possess- -ion of the facts as soon as possible in view of your impending departure from HusHire. I venture to hope that the action taken by His ioccellency will meet with your approval and 1 regret that the labour involved precluded a telegraphic reference toIn the name of Postscript to letter ifo. 13, (25th September 1930). lod the Merciful. dated 3rd Jamad al Awwal 1349 May you liye long. lor a long time our subjects have been complaining about the treatment they receive in Bahrain and of the extra duties they are charged and also there has been a question about nationality.

March 23, 1920. iOOHgiaaHTIAL No* Political Agenoy, Bahrain Dated the 18th March 1920* To The Deputy Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, V ^ B u s h i r e« Memorandum* Reference your telegram No* x 553 dated 1‘oth March, 192o x not repeated to Baghdad 0 Subject reduction of Dustom duty on ’’tranship' goods, bahrain* According to your instruction given me in your above mentioned telegram, I yesterday paid an official visit to Shaikh Isa-and discussed the question on the lines suggested by you* Shaikh Hamad was present at the interview* I was particularly careful to approach the matter in as friendly a way as possible and in repeating what you told me I took the line that you were anxious to appear in the light of a friendly advisor. I emphasized the point that Bin baud was also a friend of His Majesty 1 s Government and had appealed to you to adjudicate the matter* You were bound to look at the question from the point of view of a neutral, and any advice you gave was of necessity strictly impartial* Bin Baud, I said, had a grievance in that at almost every port in the world it was customary to take a minimum custom duty from tranship goods, such duty in places like Basrah being 1 ft only, and in Bombay I believed ^ Prom the very opening of my conversation, I could see, Bhaikh Isa T s mind was made up, even though shaikh Hamad did all he could to persuade his father to adopt a reasonable attitude: Shaikh Isa, having let me say all I had to say, replied that on no condition, whatsoever, would he agree to reducing the present rate of 5 ^ to % fo merely in order to please Bin Baud. Bin Baud mighta make as g00£i a Gase &amp; s iie pleased, but he (Shaikh isa) reiased to ae dictated to by another ruler in the manage ment of his own affairs, therefore it was useless to ask him to think of reducing his customs merely in order to effect a friendly settlement between him and 3 i*i *3audt He went on to say that on the occasion when lie last re duced his 'tranship” customs, i.e. when Bin Sand took over Hasea, in 1913, he had done so entirely of his own free will and because he wished to attract trade to Bahrain. He denied that, he had been influenced by you in any way. Similarly, after he had accomplished his purpose he raised the rate to 5 ^ again, this also of his own free will and because it was his f haq r to do so. He, Shaikh Isa, would only consent co reducing his customs in favour of tranship goods on one condition^ and that was if he received an official order to do so from you* in that event he would not only accept the order with alacrity ( T Ala T Aini wa T Ala ^asi) but, as he said, his *3haraf w would still be un-impaired, for Bin Saud would not be aole to 'crow” over him and say that he, Shaikh Isa, had reduced the customs because he was afraid of him* Such an order would be one from Government, which no Arab Ruler could argue against, and which all would understand* in view of the above attitude I am of opinion that the soundest plan is for a letter to be written by you to Shaikh Isa which, if I might suggest it and you approve, might take something of the following form. You had heard that he Shaikh Isa, during the war and without reference to the Political Agent, raised his Cus toms duty on tranship goods from U $ to 5 $ which was contrary to the arrangement come to between him and you in 1913, and that this increase was/iaKtgkkK Juat, nor in accord with general custom. Furthermore, that Bin Saud, also a friend of His Majesty's Government, had lodged a formal complaint against what he described as an in-injustma to his sxibjQots resident in Hassa and Bahrain, and had appealed to you to adjudicate in the natter, and that after due consideration your judgment was that ^haiidi isa was in the wrong, and that he should again reduce the customs charges to f on all goods except piece goods, which latter could continue to pay at the rate of Rs*15/- per single bale (according to Sh: Isa he reduced this to Rs«4/- in 1913)• As a sort of^backhand* concession, however, j would suggest that you add the following in your letter in order to strengthen the hands of the local Customs Authorities:- (a) That all goods for the mainland landed at Bahrain must be addressed to the port of destination via Bahrain* (b) That no goods so sonsignea will be allows ed to oe diverted into Bahrain without the huler or Political ^gent f s sanction* (o) ihat tranship goods will only be allowed • to remain in the Oustoms House for &amp;0 days* Alter that they must be re-shipped to destination* failure to remove within the time limit to entail payment of full duty of 5 fb# 3* A direct order from you on something oi the above lines is the only way, I thin** to get shaikh isa to move in the matter* He, now-a-days, unfortunately, is entire ly in the hands of his third son, Bhaiidi Abdullah, backed by tne latter’s evil genius Jassim al Ohlrawi (he accom panied Shaikh Abdullah to England) Both the above, ever since their return, seem to have changed markedly for the worse- official records show that before going Home* Shaikh Abdullah was showing great promise* The contrary is, I fear, the case now# '‘■he whole policy of Abdullah and Jassim, now-a-days, is directed towards freeing themselves from British control* They reject aiiaavxoe and are tireless in their efforts to get ^haiiih Isa to adopt a similar attitude* i'he wAld talk of the rights of anall nations' which they imbibed at Home would appear to be at the bottom of all the trouble,, In my opinion Jassim r s evil influence over fcodullah ig doing a very great deal of harm, especially is it tending to estrange °haikh Isa, and spoil the state of friendly feelings which has existed between the IftLler and successive Political agents in the past* Phe present is, I think, an excellent opportu*'u ^ ***3 to show that we neither intend to relax our con trol of Bahrain affairs, nor will we tolerate injustice at the expense ox other friendly chiefs* finally an order from yoi^eettling the matter and the knowledge that I am supported will have the most salutary effect locally, especially on « hose who are steadily working against British interests here* 3d/- H#R»P«Dickson &gt; Major, c, 1,12 Political Agent* -Bahrain* Oopy forwarded to information* the livil Commissioner, Baghdad fort ^ r. ^ NO# 73- {*# NOTE uN MY MEMORANDUM NO* 72-0 DATED 16-3-2,0o Civil Ooiiimlssioner# Deputy Polltioal Resident In order that you may the more understand ^haikh Isa's state of mind in the matter of Customs, I think it is worth mentioning that Shaikh Isa puts the whole trouble down'to Yusuf kanoo, the pro-aritish merchant, here# 'rhis, in point of fact, is entirely wrong, as Bin Baud himself told me when I was in puffuf that it was the Hassa merchants supported by the houses of ^usaioi, iassam, eto# who had formally complained to him and had asked him to try and get Shaikh Isa to remove his tax on tranship goods# Yusuf Kanoo is brought into the matter in the following way# He got into disgrace with Shaikh Abdullah about two months back (see my last diary) for having had the temerity to speak his mind too oddly, at a meeting Held to discuss the building' of a new school. He on that oooasion was badly snubbed, for after giving Rs.7,000/- a3 aubsoription towards the new sohool, had this money sent oaoJt to him by -haiJth Abdullah, with the ourt message that shaikh I&gt;a'oould do without his money'. Abdullah, to justify his action, infomed Shaikh Isa that Yusuf Kanoo had insulted him and was endeavouring to make himself a oigger man than Shaikh Isa. Anyway, as a result of this and other mischievous talk Shaikh Isa was completely put against Yusuf nanoo. She latter at the time and at my advice made his peace with Shaikh Isa, but. did not offer to return the money. Outwardly both are friends now, but in private Shaikh Isa is never tired of villifying Yusuf Kanoo to me. Arom the nuwoer of stories and imaginary grievances that Shaikh Isa has agiinst him, there would appear to be a regular oompaign of calumny at work with theobject of running Yusuf Kanoo firstly„ in the eyes of Shaikh Isa, and secondly, with the Agency* I gather that Jassim A1 Jhirawi is at the oottom of it all# ’^his worthy among his many faults such as being anti-3ritish etc# &gt; is a deadly enemy of Yusuf Kanoo and would like nothing so much as to remove him from Bahrain# Aodullah, being as 'putty* in the hands of Jassim, thinks and believes as Jasim does# &lt;uid as Aodullah is Shaikh Isa's right-hand man, the way is easy where it comes to putting the old man up against Yusuf kanoo# Yusuf Kanoo, knowing that he is in the oad books of Abdullah and Jassim, is anxious for his future* so takes refuge under the cloak of his wexl—knovTn friendship for the Agency, and visits me almost every day# RESULT# one day Abdullah and J as aim visit me and tell me what a villian Yusuf Kanoo is. 2he next day Yusuf Kanoo does the same and accuses the bhaihhs of persecuting him.

It is his way of revenging himself for the xts.7,000 business, as 3haihh Isa said to me yesterday: nothing that I oould say would persuade the old man that this ,as not so.

Translation of a letter dated 17th Jamadi-a1-Awwal, 1338 (8th February, 1920) from Shaikh Sir Abdul Aziz Bin Abdur Rahman A1 Faisal As Saud, K’.O.I.F., Ruler of Nejd and Dependancies, to Major H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. Copy of Article 4 of Treaty No. 5, dated 1861. ML J • rfcoiwimmiAL Political Agency, Bahrain No» &amp;firC, Dated 28th February 1920* To The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* SUBJECT*- Objection on the part of Bin Saud,Ruler of Nejd and Dependancies, to the Shaikh of Bahrain’s policy of imposing a $ tax (or maximum import duty) on goods destined for Nejd and Hasa although such goods never leave the Bahrain Custom House* ^ Memorandum* For some months past there has been growing die-satis faction among Nejd and Hasa merchants who have branches in Bahrain, at what they call the unfair customs charges levied by orders of Shaikh Isa on goods and food stuffs landed from B*I* Steamers at the Bahrain Customs House which are consigned to Obaif v and Qatif, tiie ports of Hasa and tfejd. This dia-satisfaction culminated in the form of a deputation addressing me, consisting of representatives of the houses of A1 Bassam, AX qusalM, A1 Hawwas, and by the B ahrain merchant, Mr.Yusuf Kanoo, M.B.J!., K.I.K..K.S. I informed the deputation that I did not propose taking action unless Bin Saud himself took the matter up.Tr.is was early in January last. The actual nature of the complaint of the deputation was as follows.- •That Shaikh Isa was imposing a fixed tax of &amp; (ed vclorao) on all goods entiring Bahrain, whether from India or else where, which were consigned to Hasa and Nejd, putting such goods on a par »ith those entering Bahrain Islands. That up to 1917 Shaikh Isa had been acoustomedto impose - this ^ tax only on goods which cleared the Customs House and found their way into Bahrain itself. ' That he used to impose a 2# ad valorem tax on goods consigned and destined for the mainland, such goods never leaving the sheds but being re-&amp;hix&gt;ped on first opportunity Customs Houseon native craft* This 2^ % tax was in addition to the Ardh^ya, or ground rent tax charged on all geode lying in the Customs Warehouses* That in 1917, on the protest that the war had greatly reduced his customs receipts. Shaikh lea suddenly imposed the full tax tf 5 X all goods landed at the Customs Pier, whether such were entering Bahrain or were merely being transhipped from B#I«Steamers to Native craft* That this tax was still in force* That Nejd,, Hasa and Qatif merchants considered it to be a grossly unfair tax and founded on no precedent and prayed for its removal*' It %pears alee that various similar complaints were made to the A&amp;ency in my predecessors time, .but nothing came ox th®,, since Bin Saudlwas too closely engaged, putting his own rouse in order, not to mention his troubles with the Sharif /i Kusain to take the mattef up . And so the matter was dropped. 2# Bin Saud,, it would appear, has now definitely taken u r the matter himself, and^uite recently wrete te Shaikh Isa Ur. letter dated 18th January,, 1920 ),,asking him in a friendly way hie reaeene fer charging Nejd Merohante 6 % en 'TKAJ.fiKIP* geede, putting euch geede en a par with these entering Bahrain. Bin Saud, further, requ.etedlthat fer old friendship’s sake, the tax he again reduced te 2* X »• f.rmerly existing. T. this letter Shaikh lea returned ne answer, hut lat«,, hearing I was learing for Hasa, askedfae to sound Bin Baud on the subject. He,, at the same time, gave me his own reasons fer having imposed^he tax. 3 , I pressedsd to Hasa on 29th January, and whilst there raised the question at issue witn Bin S a ud. Bin Saud expressed himself in strong language at the way his subjects had been treated by the Shaikh ef Bahrain of late years, and stated that friendly endeaveurs to get Shaikh Isa to behave decoktly tewards his peopls had failed entirely.Ke3 tneref#re, now, fonnally domandod that Hi s Majeety’e G.veanment Should *.cid. the present point of difference between himself -&gt;ia Isa. tnaikh Isa had certainly been like a father te past, and rather than start a werdy warfare with him,, e preferred to put this case befere His Majesty’s Government, and get the matter settled once and for all. H. merely demanded that Customs Regulations as understood in civilised countries be enforced in Bahrain. He understood on Customs Tarif was ever imposed throughout the world on TRJHSh5p« goods, i.e. those which never left the Custeme Htuse, hut were re-ejqptrted witheut entering the country where landed* Ein S a ud f then, formally 'ser.ttd me with his letter 'A* (copy attached)^ this was on 7th February, 1920* At the same time he requested me te ferward it to Higher Autherity with the request that early orders might be passed en sans* 4* I give belsw, fer the s aim* of clearness, bsth Shaikh Bin Baud’s and Shaikh Isa’s psints of view in the matter* m fiAIlpiS CASS* (1) He objects, as an act ef injustice and fcentrary te all precedent, te Shaikh Isa taking full Customs Duty en geeds belenging to his subjects which are landed frem ships en te Bahrain oustems jetty, but were destined f#r Hasa sr Nejd and net Bahrain* Such gssds are never taken eut ef the oustems yard but remain lying there until Native Craft can be arranged ts carry same te Ojair er Qatif (namely a week er fertnight)* / . (2) He claims that Inter*-national Custom sheuld decide the matter* (3) He ef ceurse has ne sbjection te raise ts his subjects being made ts pay the full 5 % Tariff sn gesds that they may bring inte Bahrain and which are consign ed to that tewn* ( 4 ) The matter is one of common justice, and he him self in ns way htpes ts be benefited* It is merely a question ef his ■ubjects receiving fair treatment*A i&lt; T ejd.i bringing goods, for instance, from Bombay to Hasa has to pay the following now a days 5% Import Tax at Bahrain. Ardhiyah in Bahrain, which amounts to about second import tax at Ojair. -hus his subjects pay 15^ tax an all comodities before they finally get their goods into Nejd territories. (5) He contends that the Bahrain Tariff should only be levied if the goods pass through the Customs into the town. (6) Shaikh Isa’s argument that he (Bir^Saud) has no right to charge B% Import Tax at Ojair or Qatif, is no argument. He, Bin Saud, would never dream of taxing cargo landed at Ojair or c^atif whose eventual destination was, say, Q,ater. The Turks used to charge a 10f^ Import Tax previously to his taking over Hassa. He has already reduced this to He hopes still further to reduce the tax when his finances are in better condition. His is a new State just coming out of the Crysilis of ignorance, poverty and disorder. He is struggling to put his house in order and is compelled, for the present, to charge a high import tariff. SHAIKH ISA’S CASE. * NOTE. (l) He admits in the past to having charged 5% on all goods coming into Bahrain and 2-&lt;5y&lt;? V Tv With the exception of bales of 0 on goods passing through (tranship) piece goods on which first the 0 und sum of P.s.4/- and later 0 Bahrain for Nejd and. other places. .15/- was charged per bale. J ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ owing to roun Rs.15/ war restrictions and poor trade generally, his Customs Revenues were going down. This, added to the general increase in the cost of living, made it necessary to do something, ordered full 5/£ Customs Duty to be charged on all goods landed on his pier, whether consigned to Mainland or not. (3) He considers it is his right to charge what Customs Putv he likes provided he does not exceed 5% du^y, as fixed by treaty with His Majesty's Government (When asked to quote number and date of treaty, he referred5. &lt;0- to article^ 4 of ''reaty Ho* 5, page 6 of Treaties and under takings in force between His Majesty^ Government and. Ruler of Bahrain (Copy attached). J4) He complains that Bin Saud charges 8% Customs on his subjects when taking goods in to Ojair and Qatif, and that, therefore, Bin Gaud has no right to complain, if his own subjects Have to pay full duty on goods using Bahrain Customs House as a store godown, even if such goods did not enter the town. (5) If he went back to the 2jr% rules, as in force prior to 1916, he feared his revenues would be enormously reduced and he could not afford such loss. 5. Having conversed fully on the subject with both Shaikh Isa and Bin Saud, I am of opinion that Shaikh Isa is in the wrong for the following reasons ' (1) The treaty which he quotes has nothing to do with the N case and refers to British subjects only. (2) Customs Department, I believe, all over the world, do not charge Import Tax on goods until such goods are actually passed through the Customs House of the land to which they C are consigned. Further, his complaint that his Customs receipts will be greatly reduced if he foregoes the newly imposed tax, may be quite true, but if he were a decent ruler and made any attempt at all to rule properly, he would know that He could raise reve nues by such legitimate means as (a) Numbering and taxing his Native Sailing Craft. (b) Taxing pearling boats. (c) Selling some of his innumerable gardens to the inhabi tants and so introducing a regular Date Tax. (d) Selling arable land for wheat and barley purposes and so introducing a Regular Land Revenue. (e) Farming the fisheries. (f) Sheep and camel tax. Not to mention the various Municipal Taxes which every municipal- Vi 9 k 9 riffht to levy. As it is, none of the above sources of ity has a right to levy.572 .. ^ % revenues are tapped nor does land, Bate or Municipal Revenue exist even in name, and this by reason of the suicidal policy of the Shaikh who has forbidden any land to be owned by any one but himself. Result : The island remains a dreadfully badly managed and rapidly decaying private Estate with no revenues accuring from it at all. There remains the H Custoras. w Practi cally the whole of Shaikh Isa ! s income is obtained from this source. Yet here again, he appears utterly incapable of putting even his own Customs House in order* estimate that his Customs roughly should bring in 15 to 20 Lakhs of rupees per annum. It actually brings in from 7 to 1C Lakhs. The scandalously managed Syndicate which runs the customs must be held resposible for the deficiency. I, further, recommend the quashing of this incipient trouble at once, before it is allowed to grow bigger and give us endless trouble. Bin Saud, now a days, imagines he is surrounded by enemies, all trying to fleece him in some way or other, his attidute is rather that of a lioness robbed of her cubs. -ron what I saw of him lately he seems bent on getting what he calls justice done to his subjects. Should he fail to get this pre sent complaint attended to, it will only make him more bitter, than he is already. He will only retaliate by putting an embar go on sheep, ghi and dates, and the stupid and short-sighted policy of Shaikh Isa will only come back on to his own head. Not can His .Majesty's Government afford to see Bin Saud startim a quarrel with the Ruler of Bahrain, his Eastern neighbour. I recommend Shaikh Isa be ordered to remove the increased taxation and go back to the 2** system as existing before 1916, but tmt the existing tax of Rs.ld/- per bale remains as at present. If he wants to make more revenue, the opportunity is a good one, nr ght be told, of improving his system of Government and rai sing other taxes by legitimate means, and not at the expense of his neighbours, who also are fix friends of Kis Majesty-s Government.

NOTE It should be clearly understood that Bin Baud demands that no tax be paid on tranship goods, but that only % '^rdhiyah' or ground rental be charged. My proposals do not go as far as this though it would appear Bin Baud’s contention is right in principle.Translation of a letter dated 17th Jamadi-al-Awwal, 133?

After compliments, i I informed your honour of the communication of the respected Shaikh Isa regarding customs duties* It is true I haa written to him as he expects me to do so in certain case urging that I shall refer directly to him and then he would settle matters between us. As he is like my father and as I had promised to make direct communication of this sort to him, I addressed him on this subject, hy original intention was to inform you of the matter later. At the time of writing to Shaikh Isa I . also wrote to you a letter through Abdul Aziz Qusaibi, direc ting him to inform your honour of the result of my communi cation to Shaikh Isa. ITow, thank God, the desired object tl will be gained, as you will be the medium in the matter. My complaint against Shaikh Isa is that he has no riight to charge duty on transhipment cargo which is landed at Bahrain and then re-exported to my territories, namely, Ojair Qatif and Jubail, Ardhiyah (ground rent) alone being charged. But he has every right to charge duty on goods entering tue town and sold in the town by my subjects like any other goods imported by Bahrain Merchants for Bahrain. That His Excellency mentioned to your honour that I have oeen charging duty on the goods of his subjects who imported merchandise and of course nothing enters my territories into my tcrritories^which. is not sold in them and, txiej.ea.ore, I have every right to charge them duty just as His Excellency is entitled to charge duty on goods imported into hx his territoty and sold in it by my subjects; but what is brought on my shores for transhipment. I have no right absolutely to charge any except the ground rent. If his Excel - . c;, bases his argument on the days of the Turks, these people(ii)- 5*75 were unjBst to their subjects and to the people in general* As regards myself, no arrangement has taken place between Shaikh Isa and myself regarding anything and the duty charged on goods of my subjects is unjust and contrary to the regu lations which I do not eonsent to and in like manner the .lign British Goverrirent will not like it, and your honour is my agent ( to represent the matter) in accordance with current rules and regulations*— Wo • 5. a TERMS OF/FRIENDLY COWVEWTIOW ENTERED INTO BETWEEN SHAIKH '/IAHOMED BIN KHALIFAH, INDENPENDENT RULER OF BAHRAIN, ON THE PART OF HIMSELF AND SUCCESSORS AND CAPTAIN Jtrill/ FELIX, HER MAJESTY* S INDIAN NAVY, POLITICAL RESIDENT OF HER 'BRITANNIC MAJESTY IN THE GULF OF PERSIA, ON THE PART OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, 1861. xxxxxxxxxxxx Article 4.
