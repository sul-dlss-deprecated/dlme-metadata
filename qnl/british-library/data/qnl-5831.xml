I attach the notes on Kermanshah affairs drawn up in May, 1920 by Major Weir. They need little amplification and read in conjunction with reports of the past few months they should give a very fair idea of Ker manshah affairs to-day. The leading officials have been changed since my handing over to you, and you are better qualified to report on them. Additional notes on certain Tribes have been added from time to time and placed on the files. PERSONALITIES. Rais Nazmiyah .—Saulat al Mulk. One of the Farman harma party. He has however avoided identification with any particular interests, and can be relied to work well under any regime. He is related to Prince Shu‘a al Saltanah and is a Tehrani. He is tactful, resourceful and popular owing to his comparative honesty. He seeks the appointment not so much for what he makes as for the facilities it gives him to take up farm# of Revenue and private estates and work them profitably. This year he is farming the estates of Bishewa and QaPah Shahin in partnership with Harun of Qasr-i- Sharin, and Shu‘an in Kalhur Territory. He would be a good selection for Qasr-i-Sharin if not vanted m Kermanshah, and should be supported. Rais Gendarmerie .—Colonel ‘Abdul Riza Khan, A.D.C. to H M. the Shah and educated in A ienna. A smart well educated man and a popular type of officer. His work has been most unsatisfactory in Kermanshah and his move to Tehran is opportune, if an improvement is to be expected. Rais Telegraph .—Manshur al Daulah. Has been friendly and can be useful though his interference in Politics will probably get him into trouble eventually. Rais Avgaf .—Qawarn al ‘Ulama. With acceptance of office his political views have become modified. Has been consistently friendly and is a man to be cultivated. He has considerable influence and character which of late has been used in the interests of the Community. Is poor but comparatively honest. Amir i ‘Kull Zanganah.—(see Major Weir’s remarks and Col. Kennion’s printed reports). He is constantly intriguing and meddling in Tribal affairs under the impression that his interests are best protected thus. \\ ith this idea he gave daughters to Baqir Khan (deceased) of the Kakawand’ and Amir Mu‘azzam Kalhur, both of which marriages proved unfortunate. W ere he to economise and withdraw from petty tribal and town politics his influence and position would be of great service. His reputation leaves much to be desired, and he cannot be relied on. He is heavily in debt though possessing huge estates. His business affairs appear to be entirely in the hands of Musawwar al Daulah, an Armenian ex-Bank Clerk, whose affairs appear to be flourishing. Salar Ashraf Zam/anah.--RehAWe of Amir ‘Kull and at present Deputy Governor of Qasr-i-Sliarin. Capable and clever but unscrupulous and a bad governor. Weak and lazy. Amir Muqtadir Zanganah .—AeUtixe of Amir i Kull and now Deputy Governor of Kuliai. Capable and “always on the make. Muqtadir al Daulah.-Relative of Amir i Kull and usually Deputy Governor of Bisitun. He is energetic and under proper control. Could do good work as a Deputy Governor. He is modern m his ideas and likes to pose as a business man. His chief ventures are the Bisitun Hotel, theCinema and the new rice mill. Like Amir i Kull he is entirely in the hands of his Jackal a Contractor named Muhammad Agha who is an unscrupulous and corrupt adventurer. IVasir Diican. —(Hajizadah) member of Parliament and now in Tehran W as Deputy Gfovernor to Amir Nizam, and did not bear a high reputation He and his family are bitterly opposed to Amir i Kull and his family. Other members of the family are Naqi Ahan-Salar Mu‘ayyad and Ilkhani Salar Hamayun who take little part in public life. Salar A‘zam. —Hajizadah. Figures largely in local politics and is especially bitter to Amir i Kull interests. He is ambitious, subtle and an inveterate intriguer in Guran and Kalhur affairs. He aims at becoming Deputy Governor of Qasr-i-Sherin. He made a good Deputy Governor but was unpopular there before, and owing to his crooked nature is distrusted bv all. J Monsieur Ain .—The leader of the Jewish Community, and an employee of the Customs Department. 1 leave you to form your own opinion. TOWN AFFAIRS. Kermanshahis, like the Athenians, always long for something new and the removal of Sarim al Daulah was greatly appreciated as a novelty. A majority will now' probably regret the change of Governorship, unless the promised reforms materialize quickly. The enemies made by his extortions weie more than counter-balanced by the friends who benefited, and the poorer classes certainly had no complaints to make of his regime and probably praise his attitude towards the idle rich. The gendarmes are most unpopular and a gendarme officer as military Governor will not improve the public attitude towaids Government. A strong Governor is essential for the province and failure to deal firmly with town affairs will at once affect tribal affairs.. Nothing will happen till after the evacuation is complete but the new administration wull then receive its first test. Saulat al Hulk should be retained as Head of Police if possible Gendarme posts should be maintained on all southernly approaches to the town and especially on approaches leading to the Usmanawand, Balawand, and Kakawand tribal territory.

' The Wall to reduce hi/ioV' A 6 ^- a i ku r will be combined under Government orders o reduce his independence; the landowners know that a powerful tribal chief3 will end their ownership, and the Khawanin fear their powers being reduced to that of Kadkhudas. The tribe is in process of change from a nomadic to settled tribe and a good non-tribal Governor would he infinitely preteraoie to Sulaiman Khan or ‘Abbas Khan. The Kalhur are usually in relations with Qambar Sultan and Asadullah the Kalkhani chiefs, against the Sinjabis and Rashid al Saltanah Kalkhani. GURAN. The Sinjabis are considered separately though they originally formed part of the Guran Confederacy, which is in process of breaking-up for want of a real leader. Gahwarah. —The Governor of the Guran tribes rests in the Gahwarah family represented by three brothers, Salar Mansur, Salar Iqbal and Salai Mas‘ud. Salar Mansur being the son of a Princess had the leadership till recently. He is now in town scheming to return. He is more influential by reason of his mother’s status and has an influential town party. He is inefficient and extravagant. Salar Iqbal. —The present chief in Gahwarah is a more manly and at attractive personality, and more typically Kurd. He is poor and has little real influence but Guran has been in better order under him than under Salar Mansur. Salar Mas'ud.—Tke younger brother is closely co-operating with Salar Iqbal. Jahan Bakhsk Zargham al Saltanah. —The stormy petrol of Guran. His father was hanged by the late Zill al Sultan, and lie himself is al\\a\s m trouble. Exiled for'months in Kalhur he resumed possession of his land on the punishment of the Sinjabis. He has little power or influence beyond the effect of his resource and powers of intrigue. His policy is primarily to oppose the growth of Sinjabi power, and secondly to prevent an\ s i 10n 8 combination arising in Guran. He periodically sets the Confederacy at loggerheads, and so maintains a place in the sun. Kalkhanis. —The two sections of upland Kalkhani under Qambar Sultan and ‘ Asadullah Beg unite to prevent Rashid al Saltanah becoming too powerful as Assistant Deputy Governor of the Guran. The jealousy between them is principally as to which will be adviser or “peshkar to the Governor of Guran. Salar Mansur used Qambar Sultan and Salar Iqbal uses Rashid al Saltanah. Other causes of friction are the question of the dowry of Rashid al Saltanah’s wife and a blood feud on account of the son of Aziz Murad killed by Jahangir. Rashid al Saltanah is more civilized and more easily controlled than the highland chiefs who are inaccessible. ' ‘Asadullah ! is an old man of the mountains seldom seen -away from Delahu mountain. Qambar Sultan is a good fighting chief, and was always in mischief, but has laterly sobered down and become more civilized. His Lieutenants are Muhammad Sultan, nephew of ‘Asadullah Beg, and ‘Aziz Murad Beg. The disturbing elements in Guran to-day are Jahangir, son of Asadullah Beg, and Muhammad Sultan, ‘Aziz Murad Beg and Jahan Bakhsk Zargham. Were these four men removed the country would soon settle down. SINJABIS. Sardar Nasir is very satisfactory as Chief. The return of ‘Ali Akbar and Salar Zafar should not be allowed on any account. KAKAWAND. Referred to under Harsin. KULIAI. A very quiet and orderly tribe under a non-tribal Governor. ‘Ali Akbar [han Salar Mansur, son of'the late Amir Amjad is popularly supposed to e closely identified with our interests. He should be helped but is unfit o act as Deputy Governor.SUBSIDIES AND TELEGRAPH GUARDS. Two small subsidies have been paid to Rashid al Saltanah and Qambar Sultan Kalkhani only. They have been informed that on evacuation by the troops these subsidies would cease. They should not be paid after the 1st May. Similarly the money paid monthly to the Kalhur for provision of Telegraph line guards should not be paid after May 1st as the line ceased to be a military line. F. S. GREENHOUSE, Major I.A., On relief as H.B.M.’s Consul, Kernumshah. The 6th May, 1921. TRIBES OF GURAN. Were formerly grouped in seven main divisions each under a Sultan and the titles are still retained. The Kalkhani provided two Sultans, and the Bibiyani were not represented. The Sinjabis seceded from the Guran con federacy about 12 years ago, and are now a separate tribe. The main religion is ‘Ali Illahism. The tribes provide good infantry but poor cavalry few in numbers. Rashid of Saltanah has about 50.000 cartridges but otherwise cartridges are scarce. Rifles are chiefly Russian and Turkish pattern.

Are semi-nomad Tribes owning a few villages but chiefly tilling for others. They leave the plain about first week in June and go up to the hills north and overlooking the Darband, leaving a few men to guard the crops. Revenue 2,000 Tumans. Eormerly used to be Tomans 900 plus one hundred sowars for service. No “Shakh shumari’’ now paid on sheep etc unless illegally collected by a Chief. Division of crops. —l/3rd to the landowner and 2/3rds to the settle ryot who has to provide seed etc. Practically all the land is unirrigated, and is very fertile. A large area of unirrigated land is not cultivated and should be suitable for grain or possibly cotton. The soil is soft and black cotton variety. The nomad sections pay little or no revenue and usually only act as labourers. Tobacco (Tawas) or plain tobacco is grown and is very profitable owing to present high prices. It cannot compete with the (Shaur) or hill tobacco. ISo revenue is paid on it, but will be on reassessment. It is an irrigated crop. There are ordinarily two kinds of revenue. Maliyat-i-Mulki —(land tax) varrynxg from 2 Kharwars to £ Kharwar per dang (1 /6th of a piece of land) and varying according to the land and its water, fertility etc. Maliyat-i- 1 Ashami (sheep tax )—paid only by the nomad tribes usually. The crops are ordinarily destributed as follows : (a) The zabit or bailiff takes 6/100 of the crops.(b) The balance of 94/100 is divided into 3 shares, of which the landlord takes l/3rd in case of irrigated crops. (c) of the ryots shares 2/15ths goes to the labourers employed i n cleaning, threshing etc. (d) The ryot also gives 1 man Eoghan 'j 1 Tuman cash V per juft of land. 4 chickens ) free transport four donkey loads. The tribe is Shi‘ah, originating from the Hamawand Tribe off Chemchemal Baziyan. They emigrated here from Zuhab many years ago. Sub-sections of the tribe are: — Yaramirawand. Bahmirawand.

The present chief is Sardar Xasir. His elder and younger brother ‘Ali Akbar Khan Sardar Muqtadir and Salar Zafar are detained at Tehran. All three are descended from Shir Khan who usurped the chieftaincy by force. II. The tribe suffered very severely in 1918 at our hands but is fast recovering. The tribe originally belonged to the Guran confederation but has gradually become independent. Its leaders are much superior to other local chiefs and have raised the status of the tribe which is now second in importance only to the Kalhur. The sowars are famed for their bravery and discipline and petty thieving is rare. The larger part of the tribe adhere to the present chief and his family who belong to the Shir Khani Section of which ‘Ali Akbar Khan is the real head. ‘Ali Akbar Khan Sardar Muqtadir is a clever intriguer of strong character and personal bravery. He has murdered at least one man in his time. Salar Zafar is a talker and intriguer of little real influence, though nevertheless dangerous. Sardar Nasir is the soundest and ablest of the three and rules the tribe well. He is said to have founded his reputation by strangling the landowner of his first property in Mahidasht. His son Sulaiman murdered his schoolmaster in his early days so lives up to the family reputation. The family is connected by marriage to the princely family of ‘Abdul Baqir Mirza of Kermanshah, of whom another daughter married Salar Mansur of Gahwareh. III. • The other smaller section of the Sinjabi tribe is under the Chalabi family of which Amanullah Khan is the head. He is useless and morose, and failed as a chief in 1919. Agha ‘Asadullah Khan Salar Mukarram Chalabi is by heritance the real chief of the whole tribe. The other leaders of this minority section are: — (1) . Mansur Khan ‘Alikhani aged 30. (2) . Nadir Quli Khan Chalabi aged 40. (3) . ‘Asadullah Khan Salar Mukarram Chalibi. (4) . Ahmad Khan uncle of No. 3 Chalabi. (5) . Salar Akram Chalabi. (6) . Fatah Sultan s/o Amanullah Khan. Mansur Khan’s uncle was killed by ‘Ali Akbar Khan some years ago. (»n the Turkish advance Mansur fled with Mr. Macdowall up north. R . The present feud between the ‘Ali Khani and Chalabi sections is bitter and lasting. The chief causes are: — (1) the displacement of the real ‘Ali Khani familv by the family of Shir Khan represented by Sardar Muqtadir etc. (2) the blood feuds caused by the displacement.^3) the refusal of ‘Ali Akbar Khan to divorce or maintain properly his Sinjabi wife, the daughter of ‘Asadullah Khan. V. The tribe were punished by us in 1918, but in 1920 did very good work on the frontier under Sardar Nasir for us during the Khaniqin dis turbances. VI. The tribe is allowed by the conditions of the Persian Boundary Commission to graze in transferred area south of Khaniqin (Baghchah and Qatar) free of taxation. VII. By agreement made between Sinjabi chiefs and Sardar Rashid the former promised to avoid encroaching in the territory of Sardar Rashid. They have broken this agreement by obtaining a lease of the village of Khuramabad from the Karguzar of Senneh. F. S. GREENHOUSE, Major. H.B.M.’s Consul, Kermanshah. H.B.M.’s Consulate, Kermanshah.

Capital of Kuliai tribal district on the road from Bijar-Kermanshah and 55 miles distant from Kermanshah via Bisitun (30) situated in a well cultivated plain surrounded by high hills. A flourishing market town of 2,000 inhabitants and about 200 shops, situated in middle of a very fertile district. Shops chiefly trade in tea. sugar etc. and there are about 3 gun makers. There is a Telegraph Office single line connected to Asadabad 25 miles. 2. The Imamzada Ahmad s/o Imam Muhammad Baqir is a shrine of great sanctity and attracts a great number of pilgrims passing from Tabriz along this route. 3. The Deputy Governor is appointed from Kermanshah and is assisted by the usual staff of Government officials. 4. The chief crops are wheat, barley, grapes, and a small amount of cotton. 5. Supplies plentiful and cheap. A Brigade could support itself for three weeks without difficulty. G. Water plentiful and good from springs. 7. Fuel plentiful and cheap obtained from the surrounding hills. 8. Transport about 300 mules 300 donkeys available at short notice from the villages round. 9. Grazing good and plentiful from March to June. 10. Communications. Good tracks lead to Isfanabad 30 miles, Asadabad 25 miles, Bisitun 30 miles. A motor road could easily be con structed from Bisitun, but would probably take six months for a regiment of Pioneers to make really serviceable. Only one small pass north of Dinawar valley really offers any difficulty for a dry weather road. 11. Inhabitants settled population is peaceful and unwarlike but the surrounding villages are occupied by tribesmen wdio are periodically given to petty tribal fighting, rifle and horse stealing etc. They are well armed on the whole. 12. Camping sites ample space for a brigade 1 mile south of the town on the Bisitun road. The Russians maintained a large garrison here at one time in 1918. 13. The tribe of Kuliai is in villages and tents all round this district and stretching from Dinawar and Asadabad to Isfandabad, the Senneh- Hamadan road and the Kermanshah-Senneh road on the west. 14. The present chiefs who have influence at Songhur are as under: — 1. ‘Ali Akbar Khan (Salar Mansur) aged 25 son of the late Amir Amjad Kuliai a staunch British supporter. 2. Fatah Sultan (Shir al Mamalik) of Balisht village, a great enemy of No. 1. 3. Nusrat Nizam of Mahmud Gazak. 4. Salar Ashraf of Bilawar in Kinanan district of Kuliai near Kamiaran. Aged 30.

'^ferenoe my telegram No. 210-C dated 14th : ecemher. A deputation of Somalia has claimed British protection on Behalf of a slave Boy, aged about twelve, who has Been sent By someone in JuBail to • Abdullah an-Nafisi # IBn ^a’udi agent here, for sale in Kuwait. One of them, loisa Bin llairi of Alula, states that he identifies the Boy as hia cousin Ga'id Bin 'ABdul Karim who was stolen from his parents at hur aBout seven years aro. I e says that he himself left Alula for Bahrain seven years ago, and that when he left, the Boy’s father • ABdul Karim Bin Lallan was just aBout to emBark for Bur with his wife and family. He aferwards heard in Bahrain that the Boy had Been stolen aBout ten days after their arrival in Bur, and that * ABdul Karim had petitioned the Sultan of luscat, who had replied that he had made inquiries, But was unaBle to trace him. On the 12th inst. he and some other ^omalis hear&lt; that there was a Boy who looked like a Bomali playing .^ith some other Boys outside •aBdullah an-Kafisi’s house, and went to have a look at him. he at once recognised him as hi lost cousin. l e asked him in his own language if he was a Somali; the Boy at first appeared not to understand. But afterwards replied 'yes'* in Bomali. he then asked him what his name was, and he said Ba’id. Yusuf Bin f All, also of Alula, corroBorates the story of the Boy’s theft, he says that he heard in Alula aBout seven years ago that a Boy named Ba’id Bin ’ABdul Karim ha .© ueea stolen from kia parent a in aur # and tkat kib fatuer ka petitionod tkeir own skaikk, i.ultan •Utkmwn, who had written to tke Sultan of Muscat aoking him to try and recover him, hut had received a reply that he could not he traced. le did not himself know the hoy. Mu© Somalia eaw *Abdullah an-? afiai on the subject, and he told them how tke boy had come into his hands, and s;aid that, if they liked, they could buy him or, if they preferred he would send him back to his owner and send one of them wit* him to arrange with him. They replied that they were not going to buy their own stolen child and would appeal to the Shaikh and to me. •Abdullah an-liafisi brought the child round for me to see and undertook not to send him away from Kuwait or sell him until his nationality and identity can be established. The boy appears to be either weak minded or to have been thoroughly oowed by his past treatment, and I can get nothing out of him beyond tke fact that his name is 3a 1 id. The nomalls are not sure whether ‘Abdul Karim is still alive or not, but it la probable that there are records of the boy’s theft at ^ uscat, if It be decided to take tke matter up. If, however, as I think. Alula is in Italian ^omaliland, I presume nothing will be able to be done in the matter. In the mean while, I am sure that ‘Abdullah an-Hafis: will treat him quite well.

AH three are emphatic in saying that Mulla Rashid did not compel them to come tp Kuwait against their will. I think there is little doubt, however, that he has exceeded the duties of an agent, and I think that the action which you have taken should have a most salutary effect. ' ^ . - . v \ / \ \ \ ‘ ' ' \ - • \ Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.Statement of 'Abdullah bin Huraib This year I accepted an assessment of 70 manna whereas In previous years it was only 3Q. -Vhen the time came to deliver my dues, I sent only ^4 out of the 42 due from me, the Shaikhs' share being three fifths. ^henJJulla Rashid, the* . his house and asked me why I did not furnish the full amount due and I replied that I could not do so as I had nothing to make amount, but I said that I could do nothing and asked him to send me to my masters who would have pity on me; he refused to do so and said that I must mPke up the amount to him. He kept me for two days in his room, andthen again told me that I must pay, but again I told him that I could npt; so he told me to go and find it, and I went home. Seven days later he sent 'Abdullah al-Yahya to tell me that he wanted to see me, and when I went to his house he told me to fulfil my masters' demands, but I ^ replied that I could not, and said that it would be better for both of us if he would send me to ray mm masters, unless he were willing to accept mycow as payment. He refused, and ordered me to be detained in the room again and I remained thewe for four days. During this time he sent various people who were bringing in their own amounts to advise me to settle with him and come out, and they offered to go surety for me, but I said that I could not pay the amount and that he had better send me to my masters. Accordingly, on the afternoon of the fourth day he sent me 'to Kuwait by sailing boat with a letter, tfhen I arrived here I went and paid my respects to the Shaikh and handed him the letter. He asked me about my case, and I told him that I was a loser and gave him details, and he told me to remain in his diwaniyah until he could make inquiries trcv\ Pao. I remained in the diwaniyah and was free to go about the town, but not to leave Kuwait. Three days ago the Shaikh foM us that if we wished to go home we were free to do so^ w/e Shaikhs' agent, saw that my quota was short, he sent for me to it up with. He asked me w hat I purposed doing to make up the said that we could not as we that would be all right as we would be gl which we got yearly from the Subah family 23-/2-2/ were destitute, but he replied ffraf would be given the assistancefesm p Statement of Husain, bin 'An al-Man&amp;hl, I agreed to an assessment of 90 manna. I delivered 3o to the Shaikhs out of the 54 du$ so was 24 manns short. On seeing this Mulla Rashid the Shaikhs 1 agent sent for me and said he wanted the balance of what was due to the Shaikhs, he asked me whether I was ready to deliver it or whether he should send me to Kuwait I said that I could not pay f and asked him to aend me to the Shaikhs, which he did. tfhen I came to the Shaikh, he asked me if I was the man sent by Mulla Rashid because my quota was short and I said that I was. He then told me to wait In his diwanlyah until he could communicate with Rashid. I have now been here for nearly two months. 21-/Z-Z/ i \ s tStatement of Muz’ll bln Barrak. J I agreed to an assessment of 88 raanns. ^hen the time came to deliver my dues, I found that the whole of my produce amounted to only 30 manns, all of which I delivered. On seeing this, Mulla Rashid sent for me and demanded the balance from me, I told him that I had nothing to make it up with as I had delivered the entire produce of my land. He asked me what I purposed doing and I said that It was for h?»m to decide as he was the agent; if he liked he could le&lt; it stand over till next year, or if he preferred it I would go to my masters. He said there was no objection to my going if I wished to, and, after detaining me for a day in his room, he sent me in one of the Shaikhs' balSms. On my arrival here the Shaikh kept me in his diwaniyah until he could communicate with his agent, and then 1 st me^off the balance due from me. \ \Telegram (P ) 0 From Political, Kuwait.
