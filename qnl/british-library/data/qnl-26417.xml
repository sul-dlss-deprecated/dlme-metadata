They pointed out that during a period vtfien air craft with tyre pressures of 60 lbs per square inch operated through this airfield, the natural surface was badly cut up, and caused rapid deterioration of the P.S.P.. In these circumstances, their view was that B.O.A.C. would be taking considerable risk in f recommendations and, while we have not yet had their considered views, it is understood that the Corporation are unlikely to change the route from Dhahran to Bahrain, despite the lack of passenger handling facilities and the other difficulties at the former place. 2 Following a proposal by B.O.A.C. Headquarters to operating Yorks at Muharraq, We have informed the Corporation of the Air Ministry’s /it has beenIt has been reported that Margil (Basra) airfield, \tfiich has been undergoing repairs, vdll be available for services with effect from 15th November, from vhich date the lork services to India v/ill operate through that airfield in the eastbound direction. ■Whether or not it will also be possible to route the •jAfto- bound services via Margil, depends on an approach which is being made to the Iraq Government, to lift the ban on air craft from India operating through Iraq territory.

There is no accommodation there for their staff or pass engers and ov/ing to the Saudi Arabian Governments senseless quarantine restrictions there is little or no direct communication between the B.O.A.C. staffs at Dhahran and Bahrain and messages between the two places have to be sent via Karachi. 3. I understand that there is a proposal afoot that the B.O.A.C. land planes should use Muharraq aerodrome instead of Dhahran. I am told that the Muharraq aerodrome will easily take the aircraft in question but that the Air Ministry are anxious about the wear and tear of their perforated steel plates. Surely it should be possible to reach some compromise on this point and extricate the B.O.A.C. from the uncomfortable and humiliating position which they at present occupy at Dhahran ? E.P.

G • * 1# The meeting first considered tne Survey party’s recotmendation for tne short term use of Shaibah by B.O.A.O.’s Tudor Services. (a) Political implications* It was noted that Shaiban was an. air field occupied under a Treaty of Alliance wnich expired in 1951: if civil aircraft were to operate tn.ere s rignts would have to be secured by a special addition to tne treaty* It was considered unlikely that the Iraq G-overnment 'would welcome sucn in arrangement, as tne Control and Communications facilities maintained by tne Iraqis at Basra (Margil) t/ould continue to be used by civil aircraft flying to Shaibah witnout a corresponding revenue from landing fees; it ’was improbable tnat^Iraq would contribute towards ‘extending tne runway and putting up additional buildings at Shaibah. There was also tne complication that^the Iraq Covernment would be morally obliged to allow otner i oreign civil aircr-iit to operate to Shaibah* However, as B.O.A.C. was likelp to^be tne^ only commercial operator flying aircraft tnat could not use Margil and in view of B*0.A. 0. ’ s special relationship with Iraqi Airv^ays and tne Iraq Government, it was considered tnat sucn an approacn, if it proved to be a suitable solution on other.grounds, might succeed* There was no objection on political grounds to making sucn an approacn* (b) State of tne airfield. It was noted tnat tne R.A.P. during^the war had erected for tneir air-trooping scneme semi-permanent buildings to supplement tne old accommodation, wnich was in a very bad state. Since tne war, this temporary accommodation nad completely replaced tne old, and in fact certain R.A.f/ services nad been diverted to Haoocmuya because of the bad living conditions at Shaibah* No R.A.P. accommodation could. be nanded over now to civilian use and it was probable that tno R.^.I 1 . building scheme for 194-7 would absorb all building material and labour available locally* After discussion tnere was general agreement 'cmat TUght-stop.accommodation, for wnicn tnere mignt be a requirement, could be found in Basra, fifteen miles away, wnere a good notel already existed; and tnat labour and materials for extending tne runway, (tne basic re quirement for tne Tudor service), would probably be available to canplete the work by January 194-8 at a cost of £25,000. It was confirme to the Air Ministry representative tnat tne scheme Has i^nded to be temporary and that at this airfield also a joint civil/R.A.F. plan would need to be worked out for tne provision of civil passenger Handling, etc*. /facilities. IV. 91'53facili'cies (o) Tuo quosuion whether B.O.^.G.’s Tudor services could fly direct frcxn rfhaibah to Karacni was also raised, /■*» v (d) Dmhran . It was noted that the traffic offering at Dhahran would be - very small. Apart frcm the inconvenient location of tne airfield-^tn.e only accommodation available was tnat provided by the Americans f&lt;— tneir own services; it was' very probable tnat accommodation lor .■» services would have to be put up at U.K. expense. It was agreed (1 ) tnat trie Air Ministry would re-examine tne suggestion tnat an approaon be made to the Iraq Government about tne extension and use of Shaibah for civil purposes in the lignt of the Foreign Office view tnat there was no political objection to sucn an approacn; tney would inform M.C.A. of their final views.(Action: D,D.Q.2 )« (2) that B.O.A.G. should meanwhile be asked for their views and particularly whether tne sector Shaibah- Karachi could be flown non-stop with aircraft of the Tudor type and what alternates tney needed; secondly, whetner if Shaibah were used a night-stop was contem plated there; and thirdly, for their estimate of the relative traffic potential of.Snaibah and Dhahran- (Action: Hanning Division) ■ (3) That the relative estimated costs of routeing B.O.A.C.’s . Tudor services through Shaibah and through Dhahran should be examined in the light of ( 2 ) above with a view to seeking Treasury clearance; (Action: Planning Division) and F.G.2). ( 4 ) Tnat, on tne assumption tnat Shaibah was the cnoice, a brief should be prepared for tne Foreign Oftioe to present to tne Iraq Government indicating tne terms on wnich we snould want t.o use Shaibah; at tne same time reference snould be made to tne obligations 01 tne Iraqis to provide as soon as possible tne necessary facilities at Basra and Baghdad under tne recommendations of P.I.G.A.O. Middle East Regional Conference. (Action: Planning Div ision) 2. The meeting went on to consider the Survey Party ’s.recommendation that an airfield snould'be built at f Bahrein /(Hamala j for long-term use by Tudors and aircraft of similar characteristics. It was noted that tne R.A.F. nad a continuing interest m Bahrein but tneir requirements were fully met by tne existing airfield on Munarraq^Island. U ne Air Ministry proposed to maintain tnis latter airfield on sctnetning more tnan a care and maintenance basis and would keep a 24 nour radio watch;. The political advantages of operating to an airfield in ’British influence 1 territory were stressed by the Foreign Office and India Office representatives and from the point of view of our relations with the ^Sheikh 01 Banrem, one use of Bahrein instead of Dhahran was welcomed by the India Office. It was even suggested tnat the Sheikh might be prepared to bear part of the cost, e.g. bp providing labour, building approach roads or accommodation, etc, B 0 A.C. had a commercial interest in stopping at Bahrein, but in view of the probable expansion of looul services in tne Persian auif i, -was evxden^naf on civil aviation grounds the main justification tor building an airfield for heavy aircraft on Manama Island was on operational grounds. J /It, CIV. 9193 \It was xnereforQ agreed (5) That B.O.A.C. should be asked for a resTatemenx of Tneir operational and commercial requirements at Banrein, with special reference to tneir operational requirements for the Tudor and aircraft of similar cnaracteristics (Action: ELanning Division ). (6) That on tne assumption tnat B.O.A.C. provided an operational case for use of Bahrein tne Foreign Office and tne India Office should be asked to state tneir views for tne purpose of an Dhahran and frcrn tne long-term point of view between Banrein and Dhahran; consideration need not be given to the otner airfields covered in tne' Report. After discussion, it was agreed (8) That a brief setting out the routes in India to be taken by our civil trunk services, tne facilities required on tnose routes, and tne international obligations of India under I.C.A.O. snould be prepared and submitted to the U.K. High Commissioner in India, for tne purpose of an approacn to tne Interim G-overnment, (Action: Planning Division) . 9 (9) tnat at the same time an informal approach should be made to the Indian representative at tne first meeting of I.C.A.O. Assembly at Montreal# (Action: Mr# G-ordon, India 01 lice to inform Hanning Division of tne name of tne Indian representative*) approach to tne Treasury (Action: ELanning Division ) 3. It was agreed '(7) tnat tne cnoice for tne interim period lay between Shaibah and North India (FO/ 58 ) 4* (a) Tne future of tne R.A.F. in India was discussed. All military forces were due to be withdrawn in June 194&amp; in accordance with H.M.G 1 s pledge, but it was noped tnat a treaty of alliance could be concluded with tne future government or governments of India. (b) For the purpose of enquiring tne intentions of tne Government of India on future development of airports Mr# Gordon recommended tnat tne approach should be addressed tnrougn tne High Commissioner for tne U.K. at Delni. on future development of airport; of Tudor operations was at Calcutta (Dum Burn) . The possibility tnat otner international operators, e*g# the Americans and tne Dutcn, would also approacn tne India Government to build an adequate airfield at Dum Dum at an early date was mooted,but it seemed .not impossible tnat tneir ] would be met by existing facilities. In tnis event our case would be weakened, not streugtnened. It was agreed tnat tne most pressing problem from tne point of view The possibility that seemed not impossible tnat tneir need In tnis event our case would be Planning Secretariat 3nd April, 1947 P.C.

Our survey confirmed that the only airfield on this section of the route, with an existing runway capable of taking Tudors, was Dhahran, Routing British aircraft through this airfield will, hov/ever, necessitate considerable forethought and preparation. It is not anticipated that there v 1 be any particular difficulty over Telecoms. Met. and Flying Control, although it will probably be necessary to arrange for the existing staffs to be increased, either by British or American personnel, whichever can be arranged with the Saudi Arabian Government, Accommodation, however, presents a major problem at Dhahran, and it will undoubtedly be necessary for us to build accommodation for night stopping passengers, and also for the permanent B.O.a.C.- staff on the station, Dhahran is still ninety nine per cent an American station, and likely to remain so for several years, despite the fact that it has been designated as can international airport by the Saudi Arabian Government. In this connection it is thought that it would be very advisable to ensure that British services routed through this station should be as self supporting as can possibly be arranged, as even if the Americans proved willing to help us in emergency, their resources are extremely limited. .It is therefore recommended that if it is decided to route Tudor II* s through Dhahran, a B,0,V,G. mission should visit the station as soon as possible to prepare the exact details and terns of their occupation. As is recommended in the main body of our report, an alternative to using Dhahran is to extend the main runway at Shaibah. This can be achieved very cheaply and rapidly, and if this solution is adopted, immediate negotiations should be opened with the Air Ministry, as prompt action is required. It is our view that the use of Shaibah offers several advantages over Dhahran; they can be listed as follows:- (1) Shaibah is a British airfield in British influenced territory. (2) Dhahran is subject to frequent severe dust storms, v/hich can' reduce visibility to less than 500 yards. Shaibah, on the other hand, although subject to dust storms, does not suffer to anything like the same extent, (3) At Shaibah, all the ground-equipment etc., is to standard British pattern; Met., Flying Control, and Telecoms, would only require the addition of civilian personnel. ( 4 ) There is airple existing passenger accommodation, either at Shaibah, or at the hote]. on the airport at Basrah. (5) There is a large potential trunk route air lift in Iraq, and since neither Baghdad or Basrah are likely to have airfields capable of handling Tudor II ! s for several years to come, the use of Shaibah offers a solution to this problem. (6) The interim use of Shaibah as a short term policy, would give us breathing space to consider the implications and possibili ties of developing a new civil airport on Bahrein Island, which I ** is the obvious long term solution to our problem on this I * section of the route. That is, if we do not wish to use * Dhahran. It is therefore our recommendation that the main runway at Shaibah be extended immediately to take care of Tudor II operations. DC 88050/1 1DC 88050/1 3 M. C. A. FAR EASTERN TECHNICAL SURVEY REPORT BAGHDAD 1. B agdad Wes t This airfield has two prepared runways: No. 1 North-west by south-east No. 2 North-east by south-west A study of the available meteorological data showed that a useability of over 90 /o could be obtained from the main runway alone, for all except very light aircraft. The subsidiary runway v/as, therefore, not given further consideration. The field lies in open country to the v/est of the city, and all except one of the apxjroaches are unobstructed. Unfortunately, a main road runs 240 ft. away from the south-east end of the main runway. This road is raised 10 ft. above aerodrome level and allowing for 10 ft. high vehicles on the road, it was calculated that using a 1 in 50 approach gradient, 750 ft. of the runway should be sterilised. In practice, it is not. Using a calculated density altitude of 3?800 ft. it w r as found that it would be necessary to extend this main runv/ay by 500 ft. to bring it up to PICAO Class C lengths. Investigation shov/ed tliat it would, in fact, be possible to extend this runway to the north-west by approximately 1 ,500. ft. So that both the extension needed to compensate for the 750 ft. sterilisation, and the 500 ft. PICAO 'C r extension could be achieved if necessary. After an inspection of the runway, and consultations with the R.A.F. engineers at Habaniya, it was unanimously agreed that the runv/ay v/as incapable of carrying loads greater than 26,000 lbs. on tv/o wheels. This limitation is only operative after rains, which may occur any time between October and April. For the rest of the year, when the ground is baked hard, it was estimated that the runv/ay would carry loads of anything up to 80,000 lbs. 2. Accom mod at i on Domestic and technical accommodation at the airfield is fairly modern. There is a well constructed permanent terminal building, with full facilities for passenger handling etc. This building incorporates a Control Tower, which is at present completely unequipped (see Appendix C). There is one hangar on the air field, abutting the aprons adjacent to the terminal building. It is of steel construction, with floor space 140 ft. x 84 ft. and will accommodate from 7 to 8 Rapides, but is unable to accommodate Dakotas owing to its doorway limitations. 3. General.Remarks Conversations with the Iraq Government and aviation authorities, confirmed that they have plans to build a PICAO Class B airfield on a site some 2 or 3 miles west of the existing airfield. The site was inspected, and from an operational aspect it was found to be ideal, lying as it does in flat open country, with unobstructed flying approaches. For load bearing capacity etc., see Engineering Report at Appendix A. The Iraqis produced a lay out plan for this site, which we were given to understand was produced for them by Colbeck during his term of office as Air Attache at Cairo (copy of plan attached.) Our only comments on this lay-out are that, (a) the calculated PICAO Class B lengths shown for the main runway should be 8,330 ft. and not 7,800 ft. as shown on the plan, (b) that for all except light aircraft, a one runway lay-out should be adequate. As far as could be calculated from the available meteorological data, the orientation of the main runway, as shown on the plan, is correct. Enquiries made through the D.C.A. Iraq, Akram Mustak Bey, and also through Mr. Carter, the Second Secretary at the Embassy, as to when these proposals to build a Class B airfield would be implemented, brought forth no very definite 6,300 ft. x 150 ft. 2,490 ft. x 150 ft.DC 88050/1 A reply. Guesses vary from 2 to 4 years. Our own impression was that the latter would be more correct. A general election is pending in Iraq, and it would seem that the development of the new airfield is very much dependant upon its result. In consequence, everyone concerned is extremely reluctant to commit themselves to any very definite statement on the subject. However, a concensus of responsible opinion seemed to be that it would be unsafe to count on new airfield facilities at Baghdad inside 3 years. The position, therefore, is as follows:- The present airfield is. completely unsafe for anything heavier than a Dakota for six months of the year. It is capable of being reinforced, and extended to PICAO Class C standards, and it is estimated that the work would take approximately six months to complete, at a cost of £200,000. The Iraqis present attitude is that it would be a waste of money to develop the existing airfield v/hen, according to them, they will have the new site developed within 18 months, or 2 years time. Their attitude is also coloured by the fact that a Swedish air line has been operating a D. 0.1- service into the airfield for the last six months, so far 7 /ithout mishap. It would seem, therefore, that unless the Iraq Government can be persuaded to extend and reinforce their existing airfield (which is thought to be extremely unlikely), it will not be possible for B.O.A.C. to serve Baghdad with A engined aircraft until the new aerodrome, or at least one runway, on the new aerodrome, has been constructed. If this limitation is going to interfere seriously with their plans, the only other alternative is for them to use the R.A.F. aerodrome at Habaniya, which is some 35 miles by road from Baghdad. Habaniya has one runw r ay, 6,300 ft. long, which cannot be extended. It has an estimated bearing capacity of 60,000 lbs. and is capable of occasional use by aircraft of 80,000 lbs. The PICAO Class C main runway length corrected for density altitude in this area is 7,000 ft. hence Tudors would be unable to use Habaniya, though perhaps Yorks might. A * Conclusio ns an d Rec omm endations It is for consideration that either by direct representation from the Ministry, or through the Embassy, that the Iraq Government should be asked either to undertake some interim development of Baghdad West, or accelerate the develop ment of their new airfield. Bearing in mind the aerodrome standards agreed to by Iraq at the Cairo Regional PICAO Conference, it is thought that this report contains sufficient 'ammunition' of a technical nature to enable us. to put a very strong case either to PICAO, or direct to the Iraq Government, asking that an airfield of the agreed standard be provided at an early date, since demonstrably the existing facilities offered are far below those agreed at Cairo. At present Baghdad West barely conforms to PICAO Class G standards. Airfield Lighting. None - Goose neck flares available on request. It is reported that the R.A.F. are supplying a standard type portable electric flare path. Baghdad. 23.1.47.APPENDIX A DC 88050/1 5 Engine ering Apprec iation Bagh dad West 1. General The original runways were built to lengths of 1,000 and 800 metres respectively, and consisted of A' unconsolidated depth of gravel bitumen mix, laid direct on the soil which on this site, is silt. In 194-4» the 1,000 metre runway was extended to a total length of 2,000 metres, and in this case, the construction was slightly heavier; an average of 6 ' depth of soil was removed, the sub grade thus exposed rolled and oiled, and the excavated material, after mixing with road oil, was back filled and shaped to reasonable formation; on top of this formation A' unconsolidated depth of gravel macadam was laid, and the whole heavily bitumen sprayed. At the same time , the original 1,000 metre length was given a thin top carpet of gravel macadam, probably about 1' thick. So far as can be determined, no strengthening was carried out to the original 800 metre runway. - Standings and taxi tracks are of mixed construction, some being in gravel macadam, and some in concrete; all except a small area of concrete, recently laid, are in a bad condition. 2. Drainage At no time has serious drainage work been carried out on this site. 3• Sub-soil The soil on this site is very fine silt; when dry, this becomes hard and tough, and will carry high wheel loads. When wet, however, it swells to some extent, and its bearing capacity falls off rapidly. If, therefore, the sub soil can be kept dry, there is no insuperable difficulty in the construc tion of excellent runways, taxi tracks, etc. A. Bearing_stre ngt h of existing co nstruc tion The present condition, especially of the main runway, is far from satis factory; the original 1,000 metre length has cracked over most of its area, there is evidence of silt having been punped through some cracks by the action of a passing wheel following rain, and at spots the runway has completely dis integrated. On the extension of the runway, evidence of distress is more limited, but it is clear that even this portion has been over loaded from time to time. In view of the very light form of construction, and the bad condition of the original length of runway, the safe all up weight of aircraft for this runway cannot be assumed at more than 26,000 lbs. after rain fall. When the ground is dry, however, it will carry weights greatly in excess of this, probably up to about 44,000 lbs. It is known that D. C.A's use this airfield, but it is not felt that such isolated use can justify the classification of the runway for all weather use at limits beyond 26,000 lbs. 5 . Impro yeme nt s The estimated cost for bringing this one runway up to PICA0 Class 0 standards is £200,000. This would involve virtually the provision of a new runway, and complete drainage v/orks, and it is estimated six months v/ould be required to complete this work.APPENDIX A DC 88050/1 6 M.C.A. PAR EASTERN TECHNICAL SURVEY REPORT NEW CIVIL AIRPORT BAGHDAD Examination of the above site failed to disclose any major difficulty in the way of providing full airport facilities to Class B Standards. It is thought that the development of this site would take at least 3 years from date of commencement of work, but it should be possible to lay down one runway and access road in 18 months. 2. It is, however, considered that the cost of providing full Class B facilities will be considerably in excess of the Iraq Government estimate of £1 , 300,'000 but no attempt has been made to estimate the cost of the airport to any degree of accuracy. 3* The sub soil on this site is very similar to that at Baghdad West, so that careful drainage and water proofing works will be essential to the construction of economical runways, taxi tracks, standings etc. on this silty soil. Samples of the soil have been despatched to Air Ministry, London, for analysis. Test results will be communicated to the Director of Civil Aviation, Iraq Government.(§&gt; *9 APPENDIX B DC 88030/1 7 M. C.A. Par East Te chnical Survey Metecrological Sect ion Part I - General Report Baghdad 1• General A meeting was held on 19th January at Bagdad Airport, between D.C.A. Airport Manager. Assistant Meteorologist. M. C. A. Survey Party. Mr. Carter, British Embassy. On 20th Mr. Bradbury proceeded to Habbaniya for discussion with Mr. Shellard, S.Met.O. A.H.Q. Iraq. On 21st a visit was paid to Mr. Carter, British Embassy, and subsequently visits were paid to D.C.A. and the Assistant Meteorologist. On 22nd Mr. Shellard visited Baghdad. The Iraqi Meteorological Service is at present controlled by Air Ministry. 2. Existing Pacilities Although there are two Iraqi Meteorologists, of forecasters status, no forecasting is done at Baghdad. All forecasts are obtained by telephone from the Met. Office, R.A.F. Habbaniya, and are issued as received. Forecasts are merely handed to captains of aircraft, and little or no attempt is made by the Iraqi Meteorologists to give a proper meteorological briefing, in spite of Mr. Shellard's efforts in encouraging them to take as full a part as possible in the briefings. Synoptic charts, for a very limited area are drawn for 03, 06, and 12 G.M.T* Synoptic reports, other than those for Iraq collected at Baghdad, are obtained by telephone from Habbaniya. Observations are made by Iraqi observers. Synoptic reports for stations in Iraq, with the exception of Basrah and Nasiriyah, are collected at Baghdad and passed by telephone to Habbaniya for broadcast by W/T. A direct telephone line exists from Met. Baghdad, to the R.A.F. Habbaniya exchange. Weather reports in Q code are issued on request to aircraft in flight. The reports are transmitted on the control frequency. 3. Projected Changes / A formal request has been made by the Iraqi Government to the British Ambassador for the appointment of a British expert as Director of the Iraqi Met. Service. This request has been forwarded to the Foreign Office, London. It is understood from the D.C.A. that a recommendation for the appointment of Abdul Jabbar Abdullah as Director has been sent to the appropriate Iraqi authorities. There is no firm information whether this appointment has been approved or not.DC 88050/1 8 It was pointed out that there could not he two directors. The D. C.a. stated that he would still like to have the services of a British expert, ri only in an advisory capacity, and did not wish to take steps to amend the request made through the British'Ambassador. No further official information regarding the appointment oi a director v/as available before departure from Baghdad. All future development of an independent Iraqi Meteorological Service r ^ends on the appointment of a director and it is recommended that action shoulcl be taken to clarify the present position. If the Iraqi Government decide to appoint a British director, it is recommended that action be taken, as a matter of urgency, to nominate a suitable official. Arrangements are almost complete for two Iraqi forecasters at Baghdad to undergo, at Habbaniya, a refresher course in forecasting. A. Implem en tatio n of PICAP procedures _ Comments on the requirements for the implementation of PICAO procedures have been prepared by Mr. She Hard, but no firm plans have been prepared. 5. Recomm enda tions The primary need for the development of an independent Iraqi Meteorological Service is the appointment of a director. It is recommended that action be taken as outlined in the penultimate sub-paragraph of para. 3 above. At Bagrah. 25.1.47.APPENDIX C DC 88050/1 9 BAGHDAD WEST The follov/ing information was obtained from a series of discussions between January, 19A7 and 23rd January, 1947, with the follov/ing officials 1 • Ai r Traffic Co ntrol 1.1. General The existing control arrangements are not considered very satisfactory. The service provides aerodrome control only, and the hours of watch are from dawn to dusk, with night landings on request, given six hours notice. There are no R.A.F. personnel on the aerodrome, and control is at present exercised by 3 Iraqis v/ho have attended a one month's course at Heliopolis (2 were failed.) The chief deficiency is in their lack of flying experience. Arrangements have, fortunately, been made to employ 2 British Controllers (one is on his way from U.K.), and an ex pilot (Captain) from the Iraqi Air Force, who has passed the Heliopolis course. The D. C.A. considers that v/ith these latter exercising control and simultaneously instructing the present staff, the situation should be covered. In this I concur, whilst the traffic density remains as at present 10-12 movements per day), v/ith the arrival of the new recruits, it is intended to keep continuous watch on approach and aerodrome control. No plans have yet been formulated for area con trol for the flight safety region, and I feel that Basrah is the obvious centre for the interim area control (vide Cairo PICAO Doc.C.A.143 A.T.C. C.A. 44 pars. 8.4.3 and 9.2). The language in use is normally English, and the Iraqi staff are sufficiently well versed in this respect. 1.2. Ac commodat ion and Equip ment The existing Control Tower is unsatisfactory in as much as it has a 'blind' sector of 18C°. The remaining 180° of field view allows an unobstructed survey of the landing area, but aircraft orbiting are out of sight for half the circuit. The approach to runway 31 (main runway - in use over 9Q*&gt; of the time) is obscured in this manner. A new tower will be constructed in the near future above the present one. This will be well situated v/ith a 3^0° field of view. Present control equipment in the tower consists of:- 1.3« Safety Pre caut ions A serious hazard exists in the presence, on the landing area, of donkeys, camels, natives etc. , v/ho regard transit across the aerodrome as a right of way. At present, mounted patrols keep the runway clear to the best of their ability, but in spite of this, there have been numerous instances of aircraft having to overshoot through a last minute infringement of the runway. The mounted patrol are warned of the approach of aircraft by the chiming of a bell mounted on the Control Tower. A fence is in course of erection, and until this is complete, the greatest caution must oe exercised in day landings, and night landings avoided completely. A crash waggon has been purchased from the R.A.F. and is manned during • control hours of watch. No doctor or ambulance is available on the aerodrome. A case occurred recently where an aircraft signalled for a doctor to be avail able on landing. The doctor did not arrive until 30 minutes after the aircraft landed.

The D.C.A. however, is aware of this, and when proposed improvements are implemented, a service should be available which will be satisfactory for present needs. The existing staff, given suitable guidance by the experienced personnel who are being engaged, should be capable of exercising efficient —v control, as the anticipated increase in traffic flow requires their service. 2. Air Safety Air search facilities are available in the shape of R.A.F. Squadrons based at Habbaniya, and three Iraqi Air Force aircraft based at Baghdad. Direct communication exists between Baghdad West and Habbaniya (telephone and point to point). These aircraft can cover the normal route between Cairo/Lydda - H.3 - Baghdad - Basrah - Bahrein/Dahran, but would be of no value for air search on the direct route Cairo/Lydda - Bahrein/Dahran, on account of their range limitations. Desert police are available for desert rescue operations.0 ^ APPENDIX D IPAQ - BAGHDAD 19th-23rd January, 1947. TELECOMMUNICATIONS and AERADIO ASPECTS 1. &gt;^neral 1 . 1 . Li addition to interviews with the personalia noted in the main report, technical dj.scussions took place with Mr. P. J 0 Gilroy, Chief Radio Engineer, D. C.-s,. Department, Galal Me j id, Asstt: D. C.A. and Mr. S. Pralle, Radio Engineer, Iraqi Airways. 1.2. Consideration of the facilities available (see para. 2 ) and review of the organisation oo oe developed, bearing in mind the time factor involved, left littie doubt thac lor at least another two years the only long range route Aeradio Organisation capable of carrying out the P.I.C.A.O. Recommendations for Iraq would have to be centred on BASRAH. This is in accordance with the deliberations on this matter at the Cairo P.I.C.A.O. Conference. 1.3» When the plans for BAGHDAD have been implemented, there appears no operational reason why the main Aeradio and Communication Centre for Operational Control should not be transferred from BASRA to BAGHDAD. This is'especially so, if concurrently^with the development of the new AERADIO organisation, the proposed new International Airport is constructed. This is considered a relatively long term project however. 1.4. immediate re ini orcement of the existing equipment at BAGHDAD is necessary to maintain efficiently the present facilities. Action has already been taken by ohe Chief Radio Engineer and the ' Iraqi Government for the purchase of 4 R.A.F. equipment from Middle East resources to cover the immediate future. Much delay has been experienced in obtaining deliveries and signal action with U.K. C. A.T.R*. Cairo was taken to expedite delivery. 2. Facilit ies Ex tant 2.1.

FUTURE PLANS The Chief Radio Engineer has planned a new Aeradio Organisation bo function under the D.C.A. This includes new transmitting and receiving stations, ground for which has been surveyed and action initiated for acquisition. The plans cover the full Cairo P.I.C.A.O. recommendations for LR airports and include a 12 channel transmitting station with five Marconi SYfBd transmitters. The mam equipment is already on order through the Crown agents in U.K. 4.1. ... . , . From observations made during the visit, it is certain that these plans will take some considerable time to develop and it is not expected that they will be available to International Air Services in their entirety under at least two years. 5.0. PERSONNEL The Iraqi Aeradio personnel are trained under the P &amp; T Deptt: at present. European supervision and direction is necessary at the present stage of development and is likely to continue for some time. 6.0. EQUIPMENT Bearing in mind the fact that the Iraqi Government is purchasing Aeradio equipment for its long-term plan in the U.K. through the Crown agents, it is^ recorded that the purchase of the ex R.A.I . equipment required for the _ immediate future be expedited. Local action has been taken via U.K.C.A.T.R. Cairo. Extreme difficulty exists in obtaining even minor ancilliary Radio equipment and no basic stores system is available. Where adequate R.A.F. Stores facilities are available, it is recommended that U.K.C.A.T.R. Cairo be advised and authorised to co-ordinate such, simple requirements on purchase basis by the authorities con cerned in order that the maintenance and operation of ex R. A. F. equipment now in use and on order for the interim Aeradio Services can be assured. 7.0. CONCLUSIONS 7.1. From the wider aspect of International Aeradio Services lor Iraq, the only immediate organisation which appears likely to be developed will be based on Iraqi officials, European technical direction and supervision, Iraqi personnel. Provision and operation by an operating agency to International standards may well be the solution for such areas as Iraq, but from observation guidance on a high level will be necessary combined with local knowledge before such an approach could be made. 7.2. The centralisation of main Aeradio communications for Control, Met, SAR and Operational requirements must be at BASRAH, where comparatively comprehensive facilities already exist, pending development of plans for BAGHDAD. The localise facilities outlined in para. 3 will cover projected services for the interim period. Karachi. 3rd February, 1947.DC 88050/1 13 BaSRaH 1. Bas rah, Margil . This airfield has 4 ESE - vW Im'NE - SS',7 SSE - NEW ENE - WSW runways as follows: 64.50 ft. 3009 ft. 293^ ft. 286.5 ft. long by 150 ft. wide, long by 150 ft. wide, long by 150 ft. wide, long by 150 ft. wide. Using a density altitude of 3900 ft. it was calculated that a main runway length of 7050 ft. was required to meet PICAO Class C standards, and 8365 ft. for Class B standards. For existing conditions, bearing strengths, etc. see Appendix A. The airfield is circumscribed by the Euphrates and the Shatt-Al-Arab on one side, and by canals on the other sides - see Plan I attached. It is therefore virtually impossible to extend this airfield in any direction. The Basrah Port authorities have a proposal to construct a new airfield immediately adjacent to the existing field on a site to the south-west. These proposals, however, have not progressed beyond the drawing office, and it is thought that little can be expected in the way of a new airfield for several years to come. 2. Genera l Conversations held with the Port authorities concerning the condition of -the main runway brought to light the fact that they propose taking immediate steps to re-surface and generally recondition this runway. For full details see Appendix a. However, even when this work is completed, the airfield will still be below Class C standards, and unsuitable for any aircraft heavier than say a York. The limitations on this a.irfield are of both length and strength. It cannot be extended, and although in the dry season, its strength is probably in excess of 100,000 lbs. during the rainy season, even after reconstruction, it is estimated that the bearing capacity will not be greater than 60,000 lbs. 3. A ccommodatio n There is an excellent terminal building and combined hotel on this airfield, v/hich can accommodate 100 night stopping passengers. The hotel is air conditioned, under British management, and is probably the best hotel in Iraq. The Control Tower, situated on top of this building, is well equipped and efficiently run. For full details, see Appendix C., It should be noted that this hotel is also used to accommodate passengers on the flying boat service, the alighting area being immediately behind the hotel on the Shatt-al-Arab. 4- Air fie ld Ligh ting The field is excellently equipped with flood lights and an electric flare path, beacons and boundary lights etc. Details of the lay out will be found on the attached Plan II. 3• Concl us ion and Reco mmen dat ions Since this airfield was found to be below the required standards, and could not be developed, it was not given further condideration.APPENDIX A DC 88050/1 1 A BASRAH 1 . General The existing airfield is surrounded by water or main railway sidings, so that extension of the runways is virtually impossible; only one runway, bearing 118° - 298 ° has sufficient length for the operation of even medium weight aircraft. This report is accordingly confined to this runway, and the hard standings. 2, Subsoil The subsoil is a fine silt, similar to that obtaining throughout the Tigris-Euphrates valley, but apparently less stable, due to higher moisture content than that at Baghdad; the salt content appeared to be fairly high* Subsoil water level is about 3 ft. below ground level. 3• Drainage A little airfield drainage has been undertaken to date (see Plan 2) but drainage is not provided to runway margins. A scheme is now in hand to provide powerful pumps at two points on the airfield to either pump out of, or into the drainage canals on the west, south and east sides of the airfield depending on the level of water in the Euphrates and Shatt A1 Arab. By judicious use of these pumps it is hoped to maintain a reasonably constant water table level under the airfield, and therefore practically constant subsoil conditions. A* Main Runv/a y and St andings (See Plan 2 for diagram representation of areas of different construction.) The main runway is, from an engineering standpoint, in two parts, the southern 1000 metres, built in 1936 , being of lighter construction than the northern 1000 metres built in 1 9A4* The southern portion has, in general, a construction of A' consolidated sand bitumen mix direct on the silt (in seme spots on clay filling) with a 75 - u running surface of gravel bitumen mix. This construction has failed under present traffic, and is now receiving constant and heavy maintenance; it will be reconstructed during the summer of 19 A 7 to a strength equal to that of the remaining portion of the runway. The northern portion has 1A' stone pitching under a carpet of either 3 ' sand bitumen mix, or 2 ' gravel bitumen mix - about 500 metres of each, the gravel being at the nothem end, topped with a 1 if gravel running carpet. The stone is rather soft limestone, and may be expected to 'weather' rather badly in the damp conditions on this airfield, while the top carpet has been applied with an inadequate tack coat; as a result it has disintegrated over major portions of its area, resulting in a loose pebbly surface, and one in urgent need of resealing. The main standing consisted originally of A' broken brick carpeted with -p-' gravel macadam mix and has recently been covered by 6' - 9' stone pitching, (random pitching) with a 1 ' gravel macadam running carpet. It is estimated that the bearing capacity of the standings and of the northern 1000 metres of the runway is such that a 60,000 lbs. aircraft on 2 wheels may safely use them - it is not possible to give even a nominal bearing value for the southern half of the runway, as this is rapidly dis-integrating; with constant watching and day and night repair facilities available, it should be possible to operate aircraft from it, but arrangements must be instantly available to divert aircraft in case of unusual rainfall, or an increase in the rate of failure.X DC 88050/1 15 The method of reconstruction of the southern half of the runv/ay was discussed with the Director of the Port of Basrah and his* engineer, and there is no doubt that they fully appreciate the danger of the present position, and will take energetic measures to execute the reconstructiono This will probably take the form of a sand-bitumen mix waterproof coat over the existing runway, covered by a sand cushion, stone pitching and macadam or '“nd bitumen top carpet. Materials and plant for such a job are available “ the time of construction will probably be about 2 months (working k hours a day) during which time traffic will either be diverted to Shaibah, or use a prepared strip alongside the runway, and diverging from it a few degrees so as to make maximum use of the sound northern end (some filling in of the end legs of two drainage channels will be necessary to achieve this strip.) ShpiLLder_s.jto_rim.ways No work has been undertaken to provide firmed up shoulders to the runways and it is thought that little short of full runway construction would suffice - at the present time these are so soft that a man sinks in about 1 '. btabilisation with sand and gravel, combined with drainage, might produce some appreciable results, but the opinion of an expert in soil mechanics is necessary* 6 • Proppsed Construction Plan 2 attached to this report shows 3 proposed runways; there is no doubt that the energetic Port authorities could construct them in spite of the heavy engineering works involved (bridging of creeks, etc.) but the cost and time factor will be considerable. It is considered that, following discussions with^M.C.A. representatives, the tentative proposals have been reduced to the •&gt; provision of one rummy; the time for construction'of this would be over 2 years. 7 • IVor ks S e rvic es All work is undertaken by the Chief Engineer, to the Basrah Port Authority. 23 23. 1. 47.DC 88050/1 16 APPENDIX B M.C.A. Par East Technical Survey Meteorclogical Section P art I - G ener al Report t Basrah 1 o General A meeting was held at Basrah on 25th January between the Port Director and the Chief Engineer of the Port of Basrah, the Chief Airport Controller and the M.C.A. Survey Party. Later on the 25th, discussions took place with the Chief Airport Controller, with the N.C.O. in charge, R.A.F. Meteorological Section, Basrah and with the Chief Observer of the Iraqi Meteorological Section at Basrah. 2o Existing facilities All forecasts are obtained from the Meteorological Office at R.A.F. Station, Shaibah which is itself dependent on Habbaniyah for forecasts. The forecasts are written out on appropriate Air Ministry forms (F.2403 or 2330 according to the route) and handed to the aircrew. One chart is drav/n daily on F.2803 for 0001 G.M.T. There were relatively few observations plotted on the charts which were examined. Analyses issued by Habbaniyah are used to assist in drawing up the charts. Occasionally a chart for 1200 G.M.T. may be. drawn. All synoptic infomation for the charts (except that for Basrah and Nasiriah) is obtained from Shaibah. The work detailed in this paragraph is carried out by the R.A.F. meteorological section. The Iraqi meteorological section maintains the observing routine, wind tabulations, climatological returns etc. Weather reports for Basrah, together with upper wind reports when available, are broadcast on the beacon frequency in Q code (i.e. QAM and QA0) at HH + 30 from 0330 until 1530 G.M.T. Reports in Q code are also issued on request. There is a direct telephone from the meteorological office, Basrah to R.A.F. Shaibah exchange. A meteorological teleprinter circuit is installed between the meteorological office Shaibah and Basrah. There is also an automatic civil telephone. There is no W/T reception of meteorological broadcasts or point-to-point meteorological circuit. The accommodation consists of one forecast room and one observers* room which are located on the 1 st and 2 nd floor of the terminal building. Access from the forecast room to the observers* room is by means of a spiral staircase. The two rooms are vertically below the controllers* office which is on the 3 rd floor. One corporal and two L.A.C's fom the R.A.F. section. There are four Iraqi observers, of whom one has just completed his training. 3• Pro j ected change s There are no firm plans, on the civil side, for changing the existing organisation but it is understood that financial provision for establishing a civil meteorological organisation at Basrah is to be included in the budget which is now being prepared by the Chief Airport Controller for the financial year 19 X 7 / 8 . Vo Implementation of Picao procedures No plans exist for the implementation of the Picao procedures recommended at the Cairo regional meeting. The Chief Airport Controller is aware, in general terms, of the meteorological commitments involved in these procedures.5 • Recpmendatiqns and conclusions DC 88050/1 17 6* To provide meteorologicp.1 service approximating to Picao standards the provision of forecasters and the institution of more comprehensive charting programme at Basrah appears to be necessary. No detailed report on Basrah is being submitted. At Basrah. 28th January, 1 947•BASRAH - MARG-IL APPENDIX C DC 88050/1 18 The following information was supplied by the Chief Airport Controller to the Port of Basrah Directorate, Mr. J. Malcolm, and B.O.A.C. Station Superintendent, Mr. Ryan. 1. Air Traffic Control 1.1 General Air traffic control in common with the other technical services, is the responsibility of the Port Directorate. This has resulted in the establishment of an efficiently run, and adequately staffed approach and aerodrome control organisation. Control for the aerodrome and flying boat alighting area is exercised from one control tower situated centrally between and immediately adjacent to both. The control launch, manned by B.O.A.C., controls final approach and take-offs of flying boats, and is in lamp signal liaison with the tower. VHP i^/T liaison will very shortly be introduced (the equipment is expected daily). VHP R/T is also to be fitted to the load-in van. Continuous watch is kept, and present movements average 20 daily. There are nc R.A.F. personnel on the aerodrome. So far, no steps have been taken towards implementation of the area control for the Basrah Plight Safety Region recommended at Cairo, but future planning takes into account this international responsibility. 1 .2 Personnel • There are 1+ watch keeping control officers under the supervision of the Chief Airport Controller who is directly responsible to the Port Directorate. The control officers are Iraqis, but their educational background is of a relatively high order. A well planned system of promotion on experience and merit has achieved a team of efficient controllers, all with several years experience’in control. They have functioned continuously through the war on a civil basis. The B.O.A.C. Station Superintendent states that pilots comments on control are invariably favourable. I confirmed this with B.O.A.C. crev/s passing through. The control launch crews similarly spoke well of the liason with the tower. PICAO procedures and documents are circulated to the control staff, and are the basis of the system followed. The airport Controller recognises that the staff will need to be augmented to meet future commitments, and a suitable pool for recruiting exists in the form of experienced clerks who have been working in the tower in conjunction with the control officers. Languages in use are English and Arabic. 1 .3 Accommodation and Equipment The control tower is of sound basic design permitting unobstructed 360° vision of the circuit. Half the main runway and the touch down point of runway 13 are, however, obstructed by a hangar. To overcome this, aircraft movements in the ’blind* sector are co-ordinated by a lead in van (to be fitted with VHP R/T) and there is very little increased hazard on this account. The tower is well equipped, with the exception of li/T, At present 6140 K/cs. is used, but it is hoped to supplement this with VHP R/T on 120.5 mcs. and 116.1 mcs. in the near future. (See Tels. report.) An efficient system of airfield lighting is installed and control is from a master panel in the tower. Other equipment is as follows:- Portable directional signalling lamp. ¥ind speed and. direction indicator. Pyrotechnics. All control communications between the W/T station and control are passed over the teleprinter with checking by direct telephone. QPE t s are passed as necessary from the meteorological observer in a room immediately below the tower.^ Conclusions DC 88050/1 19 The overall impression is one of efficiency. The Port Directorate are keen to see the airport develop internationally, vdth a steady civil traffic flow, and intend to provide all the technical services this will require. Several international air lines already use the airport regularly* 2. v. &gt;arch and Rescue ^9 search aircraft are available at i/iargil. The nearest centre for air search is Habbaniya. There are also 3 Iraqi dir Force ^jisons normally based at Baghdad, and one R.A.P, Anson at Shaibah, Desert police can be called upon for desert rescue, and sea rescue facilities include the resources of the Port Directorate (launches, pilot vessels, harbour craft and sea going craft.)BASRA Appendix D DC 88050/1 20 SBAIBj'J'I ^TD ABADAN 2A-29th January, 1 947 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND AERADIO ASPECTS 1 • General 1.1 In addition to interviews with the personalia noted in the main'report technical discussions took place with:- BASRAH 1 hp» Hair is on.

Delivery and installation of the equipment for BASRA is awaited. Ihe Port i^uthority Chief Radio Engineer agreed to this provided B.OoA.C. provided a competent Radar trained Radio Engineer for maintenance duties in the early stages. It was stated that this latter would be arranged. 4.3.1^ A Eureka beacon has been authorized and is required at this location and action has been initiated with U.K.C.^.T.R. for its provision. 5. CONCLUSIONS 5«1 The provision of equipment and its installation as in para. 4 will enable the Port .authority to meet the immediate Trunk Route requirements. 5« 2 &gt; Their existing organisation is of the highest standard and will f as their plans develop, enable full International P.I.C.^i.,0. recommendations to be implemented probably sooner than any other location in the Middle East area. Every assistance possible should therefore bo given at this stage. 3*3 The centralisation of full Civil Long Range facilities at Basrah will cover both Shaibah and Abadan, no matter how these may be used.

The runway dimensions are as follov/s:- Prepared main runway, sand bitumen mix, N.V/, - S.E. 3 sand strips N - S 3600 ft. x 300 ft. 6300 ft. x 130 ft. ENE - W*S\ 7 6000 ft. x 300 ft. 6300 ft. x 130 ft Using a calculated PIGAO density altitude of 3900 ft., it was calculated that a main runway length of /030 ft. would be required to meet PIGAO Class 0 standards and 8363 ft, for PIGAO Class B standards, A study of the available meteorological data showed that the main runway alone 'would give sufficient annual coverage to meet the requirements of aircraft capable of operating with a limiting cross wind component of 13 m.p,h. The airfield lies on an open gravel plain some 13 miles west of Basrah. All the approaches are unobstructed. The airfield is linked to Basrah by a sand bitumen military road. The main runway has a bearing capacity of 80,000 lbs, and is readily extendable at its north western end. It was estimated that this runway could be extended to PIGAO Glass 0 lengths to accommodate Tudor II 1 s in 3 months time, at an estimated cost of £23,000. To develop it to full PIGAO Glass C standards would take 9 months, and cost €210,000. To develop the airfield to full Class B standards 'would take 19 months, and cost ,2370,000. The airfield could be extended to Class A lengths if required, without difficulty. 2. Accom modatio n The domestic accommodation consists of an R.A.F. Officers Mess, with V. I.P. accommodation for 28 and plus 100 rooms equipped to officer status. There is also a passenger handling and movement centre situated in one of the hangars adjacent to the apron. The airfield has a new Middle East pattern Control Tower, fully equipped to R..A.F. standards. 3. Conclusions and reco mmenda tions It is recommended that immediate consideration should be given to extending the main runway to PICA0 Class C lengths to facilitate the operation of Tudor II's. 3.

G enera l The existing airfield consists of 3 graded strips 100 yds. wide, and one sand bitumen runway 30 yds. v/ide, parallel to one of the graded strips. This r /Vay is 6,300 ft. long, and consists of 3' consolidated depth of sand bitumen mix laid direct on the soil. .This runway is in excellent condition, and is suitable for the operation of aircraft up to 30,000 lbs. provided rather sharp changes in gradient are acceptable; these are certainly greater than those recommended for FIGA0 standards, but it is understood that the mission is prepared to recommend their acceptance fqr Tudor II aircraft. Flan I attached gives spot levels along the runway edges. 2, Sub-soil The sub-soil is a naturally occurring gravel sand mixture with a strong cementitious binder; its depth is considerable, certainly over 10 ft., it over- lies rock, and makes an excellent foundation for runways. 3. Drainage Crossfalls on,the aerodrome are such that surface water run off can be achieved on all parts of the field, except on an area close to the Control Tower; this area has been adequately drained by the sinking of a soak-way 30 ft, diameter and 20 ft. deep, at which depth it is in porous rock, believed to be limestone. Any scheme to improve the, gradients on the runway would interfere considerably with the natural run off from the airfield, and would involve considerable works service; it is for this reason that it is recommended that present gradients be accepted for Tudor II operation, and that alteration for gradient be incorporated in any major scheme approved to provide Class C or Class B facilities. 4. Stan dings The hard standing area to the northwest of the airfield is constructed in 6' unreinforced concrete and is suitable for use by 80,000 lbs, aircraft. The taxi track 50 ft. wide is of 3' consolidated depth, sand bitumen mix - laid directly on the soil, but there are a few concrete revving up areas incorporated at the ends of the strips and runway, 5. Shoulders to runways It is considered that the bearing capacity of the soil is such that special preparation of the shoulders is not required. 6. Extension to take Tudor II’s and to PICA0 Class 0 and B standards No engineering difficulties are involved in the lengthening of the runway to take Tudor II’s or in the strengthening, lengthening and widening to runways, taxi tracks, and standings, to meet Class C and B requirements. The estimated costs for these works are:- fa^ To take Tudor II’s. £ 25,000 (b) To provide Class C facilities. £210,000 (c) To provide Class B facilities. £570,000 Details of the make up of these estimates are attached.Appendix A (Contd,) DC 88050/1 2'5 SHAIBAH Rough estii^ites of cost and time required for development For Tudor II - extend runway to 7050 feet:- £ 1.

Recommendations and conclusions If Shaibah becomes a major staging post on the main trunk route through to India and beyond, it will be necessary to examine the requirements for R.A.F. and civil aircraft and to formulate a suitable organisation in the light of conditions prevailing at that time, having due regard to R.A.F. and M.C.A. policy for future development, 6. No detailed report for Shaibah is being submitted. At Basrah. 28th January, 1947#APPENDIX C DC 88050/1 27 SHAIMH The following information was obtained from the Duty Control Officer at Shaibah. 1. Air^Traffic Control 1.1, Genera l This is an R.A.F, station, adequately equipped, but somewhat below strength. It is suggested that if civil aircraft are to increase their use of the aerodrome two more civil controllers should be added to supplement present staff. Owing to its isolation and climatic conditions, efficiency soon becomes impaired by unduly long working hours. On the other hand, movements are infrequent at present (of the order of 10 per day). Approach and aerodrome control are pro vided on a dawn to dusk basis, but the tower is never vacated, and a control officer is always on call for emergency night landings* There is no intention of reducing the facilities, so far as is known. 1.2, Pe rso nnel Present strength is as follows 3 Flying Control Officers (2 about to be demobilised). 3 Airfield Controllers. 2 Flying Control Assistants. 1.3, Accommodation and Equipment The control tower is well planned with unobstructed vision, and is equipped as follows P/F Vt 6440 K/cs.

The Army at Shaibah provide a desert rescue squad with suitable vehicles and comirunications equipment. \APPENDIX D DC 88050/1 28 SHAIEAH The R.A.P. Aeradio organisation is to full Transport Comand Staging Post standards as regards available facilities. The lack of personnel is however acute and only limited service can be provided. /N 1.1. As with other like locations on the main Civil Air Rouces, it is unsound to plan Civil Air Services dependant on service facilities. The Civil Air Route Organisation is now far advanced in planning and implementation and no advantage can accrue irom basing our short or long term requirements on the service facilities at Shaibah. 1.a.

It has two bitumen macadam runways as under:- mm - SSE SW - NE /,000 ft. long x 150 ft. v/ide. 6,000 ft. long x 150 ft. wide. These runways were only completed approximately a year ago, and are in excellent condition. They have a designed bearing strength of 120,000 lbs. but it is estimated that they could quite safely carry loads of 200,000 lbs. Using a PICA0 density altitude of 3*100 ft. it was calculated that a runway 6,814 ft. would be required to meet PIGA0 Class 0 requirements. It was agreed, therefore, that from the point of view of runways, Dhahran meets PICA0 Class C standards as it stands - further development to PICA0 Class B standards could be achieved, as both runways are readily extendable. A runway length of 8,083 ft. would be needed to meet PICA0 Class B requirements, and it is estimated that it 'would cost £350,000 to extend the existing runways. This estimate takes into account widening the main runway by 50 ft. It was considered necessary to base this estimate on full instrument runway conditions, since a study of the available meteorological data shov/ed that during the summer, and even sometimes during the winter, the airfield was frequently subject to local rising sand, which was capable of reducing visibility to less than 500 yards. 2• Ac c ommo da tion As was already known, there is very little accommodation on this airfield. The Americans have, however, recently converted a hospital to accommodate 25 night stopping passengers for TWA, but it is doubtful if this accommodation would be available to B.O.A.C. It it was found necessary to use Dhahran on the trunk service, it would be essential to erect some sort of temporary accommoda tion for emergency night stops. There is a terminal building, which, although small, is well equipped and air conditioned. There is one small hangar on the airfield capable of housing aircraft of the Dakota Class, but nothing larger. 3• Airfie l d L igh ting There is a standard American electric flare path installed on .both runways. There is no approach lighting. 4. Concl u sio ns an d Rec omm endations Since this airfield meets PICA0 Class 0 standards from the point of view of runways, it could obviously be used by Tudor II’s. However, the additional problems involved in operating Tudor II’s from this airfield would be considerable - accommodation, spares, maintenance, re-fuelling, etc. , would all have to be arranged, and it is thought that the .Americans may well prove- unwilling to help much in this respect. (Note, The A.I,0.0. Oil Company expressed an interest in the possibility of our running British aircraft through Dhahran, since at the moment all the fuel installations on the airfield are American. It appears that there is an old treaty which gives Britain the right to instal her own petrol installations at any place in this area, should she so desire, and it was pointed out to us that if we were to give the British Oil Companies concerned, sufficient notice of our intentions at Dhahran, they would be willing to instal British re-fuelling facilities on the airfield. This might well be a point to follow up, since it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the Americans would re-fuel their own aircraft first, in preference to British aircraft, should there at any time be a build up of aircraft on the station.)DHAHRAN APPENDIX A DC 88050/1 30 Engineering Appreeiation 1. .General Two runwa 3 r s (7,000 ft. long on bearing 3A5° and. 6,000 ft. on bearing 245° each 150 ft. wide) with their associated taxi tracks (each 60 ft. wide) about 20.000 yds. super of standings, were completed by American A.A.F. engineer^ in January, '1946, close to the site of an earlier R.A.F. airfield. Camp facilities as noted in the general report, were completed at the same time, 2. Sub .Soil The sub soil is rock outcropping at many points, and over laid by only a few feet of laterite and sand; this rock appeared to be hard limestone, and was used for macadam work on the runways and for building construction. 3. R unw ays, Tax i Tracks and Standings Certain parts of these are constructed on rock; on all other parts the minimum construction was stated to be to a total depth of 22' made up of 4” premix macadam (machine laid) on 6” crushed rock, which in turn was on a minimum of 12' of thoroughly consolidated (wet) laterite; in all cases when this laterite was not founded on rock it was taken down to such a depth as to reach fim well graded sand. Only limited consolidation of shoulders has been under taken at places where drift sard was encountered. It must be recorded that the above information was given verbally on site, and that it was impossible to obtain any check on it from record drawings. All surfaces are in excellent condition, and indicate first class workmanship the application of a seal coat this summer will finally complete the job. All surfaces will safely carry a 135,000 lbs. aircraft, and, I consider, a 200,000 lbs. aircraft; since the original basis of design was stated to be 120.000 lbs. and the field is under American Control, it would be essential to obtain the concurrence of the appropriate American authorities to this higher loading. 4. Possib le Extension s From a physical point of view, both runways can be extended to Class B lengths with a slight change in gradient at the north end of the 345° runway.- the existing runways are practically level. The execution of such extensions would present considerable difficulties as the American construction force has been withdrawn together with its serviceable equipment. The introduction of Contractors organisation and plant would, therefore, be necessary, resulting in disproportionately high costs for a small amount of work; furthermore, American and Saudi Arabian interests would have to be taken into consideration. Very approximately the costs for provision of Class B facilities on 345° runway would be:- To extend one runway to 8,085 ft. and widen to 200 ft., extend one taxi track and widen it to 80 ft. (all in construction similar to existing). Time would be about 9 months. Alternatively, runway extended in length only could be executed with a comparatively minor organisation at a cost of: It is suggested that the field be accepted as fulfilling Class C requirements, even with taxi track width of 60 feet. £ 350,000 £ 100,000 3.2.47.DC 88050/1 31 APPEI'IDIX b M.C.A.

The accommodation consisting of two rooms is located in the main terminal building. * There is one W/T receiver for reception of meteorological broadcasts. Synoptic data was also received from T.W.A. at Payne Field. 3* Projected Changes It was intended that as from a date very early in February, 1947&gt; forecasts would be prepared and issued by Dhahran. PICAO procedures would be introduced, and weather reports for aircraft in flight would be issiled on METAR code. Dhahran would prepare route forecasts for the route Habbaniya to Dhahran, and Dhahran to Karachi, with terminal forecasts for Habbaniya, Basrah, Dhahran, and Karachi. The forecasts would be in NAMET code, and issued twice daily at 0400 and 1600 G.M.T., covering periods (both route and terminal forecasts) 0400 - 2200 and 1600 - 1000 G.M.T. These messages would not be broadcast, but would be addressed to T.W.A. at Payne Field and Bombay. The two forecasters intended to maintain a 24 hour watch. T.W.A. were being asked by Mr. Odell for a third forecaster, but as Mr. Fox was due to leave Dhahran at the end of May, it is doubtful whether there would be 3 forecasters there for any appreciable time.

This economy in personnel appeared to be achieving successful results, though it is . considered that an increase in traffic flow will require separate staff. The system in use is that the Control Room maintains a continuous listening v/atch, and exercises approach control.

GENERiiL 1.1. The general picture of the Civil Aeradio facilities available and required for Trunk Route purposes in this area is confused both as regards the method of operation and as to the best available location. 1.2. Broadly speaking, it is a combination of three systems and other than taking immediate action for certain facilities required to give essential services at the moment. Action such as is outlined in 2.1.4 seems the only feasible long term solution. 1.3* Operationally, there is a requirement for a centralisation of the Acradio facilities for A. T. C. MET etc. either at Bahrein or Dharhan, with Basra exercising the long range function. 1.4* The absence of a comprehensive Control and Met organisation in the area calls for more direct linkage with such locations as CAIRO and KARACHI than would otherwise appear necessary. The matter was raised during the CAIRO P. I.C.A.0. deliberations and the recommendations made there assumed certain factors which may or may not materialise for some time to come. 1.5. Bearing these facts in mind, effort has been concentrated in:- 1.5*1* Establishing essential Point to Point linkage for interim use (see 2.2.) 1.5.2. Assessing existing facilities and requirements from an area view point, rather than for each particular location, with a view to making a recommendation which would effect centralisation and serve all Civil Aeradio requirements as far as they are foreseeable. 1.6. The necessity of discussions with the Indian D.G.C.A’s depe.rtmcnt and talks with the relevant American Operatives, delayed the compilation of this report until these could be completed at Karachi. 2. ASSESSMENT OP REQUIREMENTS 2.1. L ong Ter m: Reference to the General survey report on this area and the SUMMARY on the route Lydda. to Karachi shows that the conclusion reached to recommend BASRA as the main Long Range Communication Centra (Sec BASRA report 5.3) is basic for the Persian Gulf area. 2.1.1. The use of DHARHAN by long range services either British or American will not, in the main, preclude the success of 2.1 since adequate signalling coverage is assured but influences the telecommunications conclusions regarding BAHREIN. 2.1.2. The Americans already find the need to join the existing Civil Aviation Long Range Point to Point network and, at talks held at Karachi, it was apparent that co-ordination of their facilities with ours and those of the relevant Governments on lines recommended by the CAIRO P. I. C. ix.. 0. documents is rapidly being forced upon all concerned. liny step taken in this direction appears highly desirable if duplication or even triplication, with consequential obvious difficulties, is to be avoided in the Aeronautical Telecommunications Organisation for this Region.DC 88050/1 35 2.1.3. Prom a Telecoms, viewpoint, the close proximity of DlLuRHAN and BAHREIN allows centralisation of the main Aeradio facilities at one or the other, with localised communications and navigational aids for each. The policy aspect however may well bo the deciding factor. It has been n.ssumed that BAHREIN will best meet British requirements. 2.1.q.. Prom the discussions held, it is recommended that the following main outline be adopted; 2.1.4.1. Centralisati on of Aeradio facilities at Bahrein i n one main Aeradio station qperalJcd. on Agency oasis «to the scale outlined in para. 3.1.6. r if 2.1.4.2. Act ion t o be initiated to secure the operation of existing facilities at Dharhan (See 4.4.5) on the Cairo P. I.C.A.O. International Civil Aviation irequencies, thus allowing their use by all civil aircraft as necessary. 2.2. Short Term: &lt;i. 2.1. The visit to Dharhan revealed that the American operatives required direct linkage with Karachi. The desirability of such facilities had already °en raised by T.W.A. but there were some objections, based mainly on the Cairo P.I.C.A.O. recommendations. Fr ° m thG MGt and C0NTR0L aspects, the direct linkage of KARACHI - S -7? 7 L T DDil “ BAHREIN and BASRi* was a basic Telecoms, requirement for British i^ir Services. 2.2.3. To give support to 2.2.1 appeared highly desirable. (see 2.1.2) and action was taken on arrival at Karachi to secure its implementation, nnnoxure n ^ to uhis report is an iAde iuemoire prcpa.red at Karachi during ^ e nego io. ions and gives the main outline. Pinal agreement and implementing ^-c ion will be secured a.t Delhi. All concerned expressed agreement in principle a.nd urge that this scheme be implemented by 1st March 1947 as an interim step in the Long range Aeradio network for the area. 3. BAHREIN 3.1.

Direct linkage with KARACHI on C/A Pt, to Pt. network. 4.6.2. Bearing in mind the designation of DHARHAN as a Long Range Inter national Airport and the establishment at BA.SRA of long range Aeradio facilities under the CAIRO P.I.C.-u.0. findings, it is strongly recommended that action be initiated to secure the operation of the facilities out? led in 4.5.1 on International Civil Aviation frequencies. Adequate coverage can then be provided for Civil aircraft using or overflying DHARHAN and co ordination with BAHREIN will bo automatically assured. 4.7. Personal difficulties exist, but sufficient equipment is available to meet our requirements. 4.8. As far as could be ascertained, there would be no technical objections to the installation of Radar ^.ids such as Eureka and Babs Mk.II if so desired for British Air Services. The airfield is ideal for the use of such aids. 5.0. SIL-RJ/Ji 5.1. The visit to Sharjah was from a Telecoms aspect influenced by the discussions at Bahrein and in light of action taken in London regarding the Civil Aeradio facilities, prior to the Survey Party’s departure. 5.2. It was known that the R.A.F. intention was to retain SHARJAH to normal Transport Command Radio facilities. I 5.3. The Political Resident at BAHREIN had pointed out that the maintenance of the Civil Aeradio Station at SHARJAH was part of the existing agreement and desired action for its continuance, ss an interim measure, pending a final decision. Further the Point to Point system linking to Karachi and Bahrein is used as a Cable and Y/ireless Agency in addition to ^eradio commitments. 5.4. Investigation on the spot revealed that the R.A.F., due to personnel difficulties, can only maintain, at the present, the barest minimum facilities (see 5*8.1). Discontinuance of the Civil Air/G-round and Point to Point channels would seriously affect Aeradio Communications for Air services on the Bahrein- Karachi route. 5.5. The closure of the Aeradio faci lities at MASIRAK^ is a further very important consideration when reviewing the intermediary signalling points available to air craft in this area. 1 5.6. Accordingly, a signal was made to M.C.A. and B.O.A.C. London for interim authority to continue the operation of this station. I 5*7. Concurrence with the recommendation contained in 5.6. is most strongly urged. Cessation of the Civil facilities at this location may be serious and to I re-establish at a later date would involve many difficulties. ■ 5.8. Existing Facilities 5.8.1.

It was agreed that the proposed additional network to the existing Civil Aviation channels was considered sufficient to meet the Operators' immediate requirement and was in general concord with plans of D.G.C.A. Dept. India and P.I.C.A.O. recommendations. 1•3• Discussion revealed that a further 'breaking down' of the network may be necessary in the light of operational experience, but that the outline given in the Aide Memoire was satisfactory for the present. 1.4. The Chairman asked if the procedure for implementation of the facilities as outlined in the Aide Memoire was acceptable. It was decided to proceed on those lines. 2. TRAFFIC TO BE HANDLED The talks centred on the operational function of the circuit. A rough assessment of the MET traffic to be passed was given and the following points agreed after D.G.C.A's Representative had warned the meeting of the necessity for such limitations. 2.1. The circuit to be designated ”Aeradio Operational Point to Point Circuit' and to be utilised for the passing of essential control traffic, terminal to terminal Met. information as defined in Cairo P.I.C.A.O. Doc and emergency amendments thereto, and such other operational traffic as the load ing will permit. 3* The meeting agreed to proceeding with discussions at Delhi for final con currence of D.G.C.A. Dept, and for initiating action as outlined in the Aide Memoire. 3.1. The representatives of P.A.A. expressed their concurrence and stated that the facilities suggested met their immediate requirements.41 DC 88050/1 © N AIDE iViMOIRE Civil Aviation Operational Point to Point Facilities - Area Eastern Mediterranean to India Annexure *A ' 4 1. GENERAL 1.1. A British Ministry of Civil Aviation Survey party has recently surveyed the route facilities extant in the area mentioned above. It was clearly apparent tl^t a minimum reinforcement of the main staging post and terminal point to point fi ilities was necessary. This was due, in the main, to the time factor involved in implementing of the Cairo P.I.C.A.O. Civil Aviation recommendations and to the very rather limited Met and operational control facilities available. 1.During the visit to Dharhan, a request was received for direct communication Karachi/Dharhan on behalf of American operators. 1 O. On arrival at Karachi, the Tels. Adviser to the M.C.A. Survey Mission and the Regional Signals Officer, B.O.A.C. approached the D.G.C.a's Department local official for his views on the point to point requirements. 1.4-. It was early revealed that in addition to the British operator's’ request there were additional requests from American operators. 1.f. The D.G.C.A’s Deptt: India had already formulated an outline plan for just such point to point organisation working from India westwards. 1.6. there exists, at the moment, long range Civil Aviation net-work operating on schedule basis linking many of the relevant locations and a short range interstage net-work linking all intermediary points. 1./. The frequencies employed are dangerously over-loaded from an operation view point and the creation of an additional main staging post net-work appeared the only solution. 2. ACTION INITIATED 2.1. After discussion, agreement was reached to signal Air Headquarters of the D.G.C.A s department in Delhi for agreement in principle for the opening of an independent operational Civil Aviation Point to Point medium stage channel from Karachi linking Basra, Lydda, Dharhan and/or Bahrein Cairo and Ankara. The suggested frequencies are 10955, 8140, 3670 Kcs. operating on continuous basis with scheduied. times for normal traffic. The existing long range network on 1o05, 12012, 9510 and 4145 Kcs. to be retained for terminal to terminal working such as Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta, Colombo, Rangoon, Singapore, Hongkong, with variations as operational commitments decide. 2.2. Advice has been received that D.G.C.AJs Department Delhi agrees in principle and the discussions will be pursued for immediate implementation within a few days at Delhi. 2 . 3 . A signal indicating the decisions already reached will be prepared for trans mission to all relevant authorities. 3. OTHER OPERATORS’ REQUIREMENTS 3*1. Coincidental v/ith the above negotiations, representatives of P.A.A. and T.W.A. arrived in Karachi to discuss their requirements. It was indeed fortunate that such an opportunity arose since it was clearly apparent that the operational need ° r , facilities was common to all operators concerned and it presented to the a.G.C.A s Department^ an opportunity to implement an International Civil Aviation Point to Point facility on a common basis. The desirability of provision of these facilities in this manner affords an immediate opportunity of implementation of agreed P.I.C.A.0. International policy. 4. CONCLUSIONS . It is f therefore, desired that the representatives of Operators concerned review the negotiations and plans outlined above and indicate their concurrence The details of the operational procedure to be adopted, the assessment of average traffic loads and the probable efficiency of the freauencies chosen to be left to the responsible technicians. Karachi, 7th February, 194743 DC 88050/1 ABADAN 1 . This airfield lies approximately 30 miles down river from Basrah, and is in Persian territory. It has A runways as follows:- NW NW - SE - SE 7190 ft. long by 120 ft, wide. 6020 ft. long by 150 ft. wide. Parallel. E NE W SW A200 ft. long by 120 ft. wide. 2750 ft. long by 120 ft. wide. This airfield lies in a flat open stretch of country. The approaches are all unobstructed, with the exception of the NE end of the NE/SW runway, which is obstructed by high tension cables and W/T masts. Originally, the field was built by the Anglo Iranian OiA Company, for their own private aircraft. During the war, it was considerably extended, and developed by the Americans. For full details see Appendix A. The 2 long runways are both capable of extension up to 10,000 ft. but their load bearing capacity would have to be greatly increased before they could be used for our purposes. 2. General Although at first sight, this airfield appeared to offer several advantages over Basrah, investigations showed that, in fact, this was not so. The runways are in extremely poor condition, and there would appear to be very little hope of their being reconditioned, either by the Iranian Government or the A.I.O.C, The A.I.O.C.’s attitude being that the existing runways are good enough for the light aircraft which they intend to operate, and they see no reason to develop them, their plan being merely to maintain such portions of the runways as are required for the operation of the Company’s aircraft.' The Iranian Government, although they have designated Abadan as an international airport, would seem to have no very clear cut policy regarding its future development or maintenance. The Persian D.G.C.A., Monsieur Chaffik, who met us on arrival, explained that he had very little money, and a very small staff allocated to him as yet, but he hoped to have an adequate supply of both after the Persian General Elections in March. He then went on to expound his rather grandiose schemes for the development of the airfield, when funds became available. However, subsequent conversations with Group Captain Hughes, the British Military Air Attache from Teheran, and Mr. Drake, the A.I.O.C. Commercial Manager, and Mr. Willoughby, the British Consul at Abadan, showed that very little reliance could be placed on Monsieur Chaffik’s plans. It was the opinion of these well informed individuals that the airfield would gradually deteriorate under Persian management, as the American installations slowly depreciated; the Persians having neither the equipment nor technicians to maintain them. Therefore, since the airfield as it stood, was below PICAO Class C Standards, and there seemed very little likelihood of it being developed for . several years to come, it was decided that there was no advantage to be gained by considering it further. This decision was coloured by the fact that the party had already visited Shaibah, where it was found that the existing airfield could be cheaply and rapidly developed to meet our trunk route requirements in this area.Mf DC 88050/1 APPENDIX A Abadan Engineering Appre elation 1. Genera l The original runways 'were constructed by the A n gl o-I rani an Oil Compan}' ,o serve their own light aircraft; these were three in number, each about 850 yards long of A' 1 broken brick topped with 3' sand bitumen mix. These have since had several seal coats, each blinded with small gravel v/ell rolled in; the resulting runways are adequate for the Company’s needs. During the war American forces extended the runway bearing approx. NW/SE to 7)200 feet by adding extensions at both ends of the original strip; these extensions were of 3” consolidated depth sand-bitumen mix laid direct on the soil. x They also constructed an additional runway in 3' sand-bitumen ijiix parallel to this extended runway and about 75 yards south west of it; this runway is approx. 6,000 feet long and is fitted with the American type of HILV lighting; which appeared to be completely unscrvicable. 2. Soil The soil is silt of the type found throughout the Tigris-Euphrates valley with a water table at a depth of 2 feet in winter and only slightly lower in summer. During rainstorms water has been known to lie on the airfield to a depth of 6” and last winter it was necessary to '’.bund” the runway to enable the Oil Company’s aircraft to use it. 3. Runways and Sta ndings The original length of the extended runway is in good condition and will take a 26,000 pound aircraft but the extensions are in poor condition due to disintegration of the sand-bitumen mix, being virtually held together by the heavy seal coat; they cannot be relied upon to carry traffic in the wet season although they would stand up to occassional use in the dry season-in fact they cannot be considered as more than a dust palliative. The parallel runway is virtually a write-off. The shorter runways are suitable only for light aircraft of the Rapide class both from the point of view of length and load carrying capacity as they have not been maintained to the same standard as the longer runway. The standing at the northern perimeter of the field is of similar construction to the original portion of the long runway and has been well maintained and will take a 26,000 pound aircraft. The only extension possible to runways, without introducing major river diversion works and upsetting Abadan town planning, is a northern extension of the main runway to virtually any reasonable length although resiting of a wire less station would be necessary if the total length exceeded about 10,000 feet. A. Conclu sions This airfield is safe only for emergency diversions in dry v/eather for aircraft of AA,000 pounds and above, up to a top limit of say 80,000 pounds. In view of the political difficulties attached to this site and the fact that equivalent facilities can be made available elsewhere at considerably less cost, estimates for development to Class C and Class B standards were not worked out. 28.1 • A7 • x runway width is AO yds.DC 88050/1 45 APPENDIX B M,G»A« Par East Technical Purvey Heteorologioal Section Part I - General Renort l Abadan 1c General.

At Basrah. 28th January, 19A7.AHPKNDIX C DC 88050/1 46 'ABADAN 1. Air Traffic Control Since the departure of the American forces, Air Traffic Control is virtually non-existent. There is an excellent tower with full equipment, but it is manned only spasmodically, and then by inexperienced Iranians, It was learned from theD.C.A., however, that establishment has been approved for 12 Control Officers, 2 to be on watch at all times. Personnel are to be Iranians, and they are to be under instruction by either xiritish or American flying control instructors. It is the intention o± the Iranian Government that Abadan shall be developed into a long range regular airport, and while the proposed arrangements may produce satisfactory control, say one year alter inception, the service in the intervening period cannot be expected to be adequate. The scheme is to be put into effect within 3 months, therefore it is not recommended that British trunk route aircraft use this aerodrome regularly for at least 15 months, unless alternative control arrangements can be made. A similar situation is believed to exist on the Telecoms, and Net. sides, for which see respective reports. On suggesting training in U.K. for the prospective controllers, I v/as informed by the D.C.A. that the policy to have training done in Iran had been fixed, but that he would consider sending the men abroad for advanced-courses when they have had some basic experience and instruction locally. I understand that negotiations for the transfer of the lield and equipment from the American forces to the Iranian Government are at present in progress. The Anglo Iranian Oil Company, who use the aerodrome regularly have their own communications set up but do not exercise air traffic control. 2.

During talks with the D.C.A.

The bearing capacity of the soil is extremely low, and a ny further development of this air field is out of the question. It was not, therefore,' given furtner consideration BAHREIN New Site - Hamala This site lies on the island of Manama, which is the main island of the group. An inspection showed that this site could be developed to meet the requirements of a large civil airport. It lies on a flat plain v/ith very minor variations of level. The approaches are all • unobstructed, and it was considered that a one runway lay out would give sufficient annual wind'coverage to meet the requirements of air craft capable of operating in v/inds giving a 15 m.p.h. cross wind com ponent. The R.A.F. engineers at Habbaniya had produced a proposed lay out for this site Based on the standard R.A.F. V.H.B, design. It provided for 3 runways at 60° to one another. If it is decided to develop this site in conjunction with the R.A.F., it is suggested that an entirely new design should be agreed with Air Ministry in London, as it is thought that a one runway lay out might very well meet R.A.F. as well as civil requirements. On a one runv-ay ley out it was estimated that the airfield c ould be complete v/ith buildings etc., to PI0A0 Class C standards Jin a cost of £1,250,000. To develop it to PICA0 Class B standards would take 2^ years, and would cost £1,750,000, It could, if necessary, be extended to meet PICA0 Class A runway lengths, if desired.APPENDIX A.1 DC 88050/1 50 BAHREIN Engineering Appreciation Existing airfield on Muharraq Island 1.

This scheme was based on a three runway lay out, and full perimeter track. It is understood ^hat an investigation of the available meteorological data has disclosed that a one runway lay out would be acceptable, provided this runway was based on a bearing of 340° true, or as close to this as is possible, 2 The site v/as examined With this lay out in view, and it can be confirmed that the provision of facilities on this basis is feasible.

It is understood that the perimeter track adjoining the ends of the runway should be placed at the north east side of the runway, and that the hard stand ing, Control Tower, and administrative buildings should also be on this side of the airfield; from an access point of view this is suitable. 3, E sti mated Cost and Time The estimated cost to provide runway and taxi track, hard standing, Control Tower, Administrative buildings, etc., to Class C requirements is £1,250,000, and the time involved for construction would be 2 years. The estimated cost for similar facilities to Class standards is £1,750,000 and the estimated construction time would be 2^- years. It should be noted in this connection that several miles of access road will have to be reconditioned, 4. Conclusion The present site on Muharra.q Island is useless for heavy aiferai o, and its development cannot be considered as a practical proposition. While the cost of provision of initial facilities on the proposed site on ,',i''.nama l 1 ■ -nd is high, there is no doubt that a first class airfield coul d be provided,, .and that further development on this si6e if nccessa.ry, would be rela.tively simple ® and economical.DO 88050/1 51 These Estimates exclude cost of land purchase which should be small, as the entire area is sandy desert, devoid even of scrubs. It should not be necessary to divert the oil pipe line to the north of the site if only one runway is provided. In preparing estimates for domestic accommodation, it has been assumed that night stop facilities will not be required for passengers and crews, but that B.O.A.O, Rest House in Manama town will continue to serve this site, as well as the flying boat base.

Personnel are at a bare minimum, and any increase in use of the airfield by civil aircraft will have to be met by civil staffing. The numbers of control personnel are:- Hours of watch are from dawn to dusk, with night facilities on request. Movements average 5 per day, of which approximately 1% are R.A.P. The balance at present is mainly made up by allied military movements to the Par East. Civil* aircraft flow is at an average rate of one aircraft per three days (B.O.A.C. do not at present use Muharraq).

Control for the alighting area is exercised by B.O.A.C., who co-ordinate their instructions with the R.A.P. at Muharraq by direct telephone and monitoring on R/T (6440 K/cs). The station Operations Officer is responsible for control, and he mans the tower when aircraft are expected to land or take off. Pinal approach and take off clearance are given by the coxswain on the Control Tender, which is equipped with R/T. The tower is satisfactory, with 36 O 0 vision, and is equipped as follows:- H/P R/T 6440 K/cs. (only when aircraft are on take off or landing). Aldis Lamps. Pyrotechnics. Wind speed indicator.

CIVIL AVIATION FROM FORpIGB OFFICE TO JEDDA . No. 5 Saving. 3rd March 1947. Repeated to: Cairo, No. 11 Saving. W:W:ff:W:W BffORTMT . SPACE. ft Your telegram No.459 [of December 22nd: Civil Aviation rights at Dhahran airfield]. We require for aircraft of B.O.A. C. and associated companies operating on the services specified in paragraph 2 below the rights - (a) to fly over Saudi Arabian territory; (b) to land at Dhahran for refuelling and maintenance; (c) to set down at Dhahran passengers, mail and freight taken on in United Kingdom territory as well as the right to pick up passengers, mail z' -Iff jS and freight at Dhahran for destinations in United Kingdom territory; (d) to pick up or put down at Dhahran passengers mail and freight originating from or bound for destinations other than United Kingdom territory. In accordance with the Bermuda principS.es, we would propose that this right should be subject to the provision that the capacity provided on the services operating through Dhahran would be related to the traffic requirementsrequirements between United Kingdom territory and the points of destination of the service. This would mean that the capacity available for picking up traffic at Dhahran for destinations in other than United Kingdom territory would be limited to !1 fill-up M space. 2. The services for which we require rights at Dhahran are the trunk services between the United Kingdom and India, Australia and the Far East. The total frequency is not expected to exceed three times daily but we suggest that this estimated figure should not be disclosed now unless you are pressed to give details. The route would enter Saudi Arabian territory either from Cairo or Lydda direct, or via Bagdad or Basra, to Dhahran and would go thence to Karachi and points beyond. 3. The term “United Kingdom territory”, wherever used, is to be interpreted as including, in addition to the homeland, any territory which is under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection, mandate or trusteeship of the United Kingdom. 4. In view of the fact that Saudi Arabia is not a signatory of the I.C.A.N, or P.I.C*A.0. documents, we should wish to have the following additional assurances:- (a) that any charges levied on United Kingdom aircraft for the use of the airport and ancillary facilities at Dhahran would not be higher than the charges levied on aircraft of any other country or those paid by Saudi Arabian*1 c 1 9 » J - '6 - Arabian aircraft engaged in similar international services; (b) that fuel, lubricating oil and spare parts taken on board United Kingdom • aircraft in Saudi Arabian territory and intended solely for use by United Kingdom 4 aircraft would receive treatment in respect of Customs duties, inspection fees and other charges not less favourable than that accorded to aircraft of any other country or Saudi Arabian aircraft engaged on similar international services. (c) that aircraft in transit, and fuel, lubricating oil and aircraft spares and stores retained on board United Kingdom aircraft whould be exempt from Customs duties inspection fees and similar duties or charges. 5. By 11 associated companies 5 ’ in paragraph 1 above, we have chiefly in mind British companies such as Skyways operating charter flights in close association with B 9 0 # A,C. or a British Commonwealth Company such as the Australian Q.E.A. operating in parallel partnership with B.0,A # C. If Saudi Arabian authorities raise objection to the addition of these words, we should not wish to prejudice our chances of obtaining the rights we require for B. O.A.C, by pressing at this stage for the inclusion of the words in question. 6. It is possible that B.O.A.C. may-need some accommodation at Dhahran, in which case they would presumably have to arrange for its erection themselves. AsAs 9 however, this is hy no means certain you may leel it would 'be best not to refer to it at this stage in the formal application to the Saudi Arabian Government. 7 0 We are not clear what you have in mind in your reference to u (b) Saudi Arabian conditions’*. As explained in paragraph 4 of my telegram No,441, conditions referred to in your telegram Saving No.68 are quite unacceptable. Apart from claiming reciprocal rights Saudi Arabians should impose no conditions, although you could point out to them that the provision in paragraph 1(d) above will insure that any local air services which may eventually be started by Saudi Arabia would be protected from undue competition by our aircraft on trunk routes. This is an important limitation which we voluntarily accept.Affix jummed cab hereOUTWARD TELEGRAM Commuploatlona &amp; overseas Department I'O , ^y/ Y/QRD CODE v .

(E 11218/110/1/25) SECRET Ministry of Civil /».viation f ^ Ariel House, Strand, VV.C. 2. 13th November, 1946« Dear Furlonge, I think that Ayton spoke to you yesterday about telegrams No.418 and 420 fro.a Jectda dated November 10th and November 11th respectively. 2 . AS you know, the American Company T.W.a. have established themselves both in Persia and in Saudi Arabia. There are many indications that they are finding their participation in airlines in these two countries extremely expensive, and that they are attempting to recoup themselves by operating charter and other types of flight far outside the immediate neighbourhood of these countries, in fact, they fire attempting to use these countries as bases from wnich to muscle in on routes in which they have no real right to participate. In these circumstances we must watch very carefully what they are up to. 3* Telegram No. 413 from Jedda suggests that the flight which they wish to make to London is the first of some 20 1 lights on the same route. We are prepared to approve a oingle flight to London via the routre mentioned in Telegram No420 on the gxxjrxis that this is a special charter flight. Our permission is, however, limited to this single flight, and if the Company wishes to iiake further flights, further applications must be made to us through diplomatic channels. V t e should add that while we might approve one or two flights as being genuine charter flights, we could not approve a series Ox ilights unless it is put to us as an application to start a regular service, in which case we should have to consider very carefully whether we were prepared to approve it and, if so, on w'hat conditions. 4. I hope that the above gives you sufficient information for a reply to Saudi Arabia. Y’ours sincerely, (Sgd) G.W. Furlonge, Esq., Foreign 0 fice, S. W. 1.CflPY % ^ SECRE T Restricted FOREIGN OFFICE, S.^.1 19th December, 1946 Dear Dodd (E With reference to Dunnett’s letter No. Planning/139 of the 13th November to me about certain charter flights projected by Saudi Arabian airlines I enclose a copy of telegra 1 No* 1 10 Saving of the 30th November from Jedda on the subject. You will see from this that, while Dunnett’s belief that these flights represent an attempt by T.W.a. to 'muscle in on routes in which they have no real right to participate' is shared in certain quarters in Jedda, the proceeds of the flights so far undertaken have in fact been credited to the Saudi Government. You will no doubt be able to judge how far this information modifies the position. 2. As regards the request, in paragraph 2 of the savingram, for information which could be passed to the Saudi Government about the procedure which they should adopt in connexion with such flights, is there anything which our Legation could tell the Saudis, either about international regulations or practice in the matter of charter flights or as regards any specific trouble which they might bring upon themselves in British controlled territories?

Flight in question was in fact cancelled, received no notification of these flights from the Saudi Arabian Government and obtained information of their intentions only by consulting Captain Grant, the King's American pilot. I telegraphed for permission for the aircraft to land for all three flights, but in the case of the Durban flight the aircraft left before a reply had been received, 2. I am not aware of the regulations governing charter flights of this nature, but it seems to me that Saudi Arabian Government may find themselves in trouble if they continue to despatch their aircraft before seeking permission of the country of destination.

French Minister tells me that he received a similar notification to the one addressed to me and reported in my telegram No: 418 giving him no more than two days notice of the proposed flight to Paris and London. He states that the French Government took the same line as His Majesty's Government and granted permission for one flight only. M. Rageot regards the proposed series of flights to London as an attemot by Trans World Airlines to provide services where they are, under present arrangements, not permitted to operate. I have heard it said elsewhere that this activity of Saudi Arabian aircraft was in fact a cloak for an attempt by Trans World Airlines, who apparently work on a very narrow margin and have been hard hit by their recent strike, to earn a little ready cash. This, it seems is not true, for I learn from Messrs. Gellatly Hankey that they have received the proceeds of these flights for the credit of the Saudi Arabian Government. /'.yv i &lt;w»gm \-' F STAIESMAH - 27TH MOVaMa^u 1946 . i || lr i &gt; ‘ t • s5V ^ ■■ U. S. A. OUTPOST IH KIDDLE SAST. * M J The U. S. Army has now developed the enormous airport at Dhahran on the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia into its most important air base in the sprawling area of the Middle East. As Payne Field, Cairo, is being turned over to the Egyptian Government under the contractual terms for its sale,^ American Army officers and men, as well as considerable supplies, will be moved here within the next three weeks. The material includes quartermaster's and maintenance supplies as well as, probably a few aircraft. All will be placed at the disposal of the Dhahran Commandant, Lt. Col. Emery Ward of Salina, Oklahoma, who heads the U. S. A. Air Transport installation here. Dhahran airport has two landing strips with an asphalt surface. The field is already large enough to handle B-29s or, indeed, any aircraft still in the drawing-board stage. It could be extended indefinitely over the flat sandlands of the vicinity. In a few weeks, the airport will be the only base under direct U. S. Army control between Tripoli, Libya and Karachi. Under contract with the Egyptian Government, landing rights at Payne Field are being continued, according to Lt. Col. Ward, and half- a-dozen U. S. Army Personnel are being left there for the present. Within the next^Tew days, Lt. Col. Ward expects the arrival of the complement of 6 officers, 5 men, 32 American civilians, 135 Italians (brought up from Eritrea) and 135 Arabs. Already Dhahran airfield handles weather forecasts for the regions between Karachi, Cairo, Asmara and Teheran and its^ control area of 16,000 square miles is the largest single station control area in the world. Dhahran is under the direct command of Paris HQ, Air Transport Command, European theatre. As the airbase is now set up, it could at almost immediate notice handle 600 American officers and men or Sne Heavy Bombard ment Group. Under the terms of the U. S. Government contract with the Saudi Arabian Government, it is understood that any type of civilian or military aircraft can be based here. The airfield was developed during the war in order to facilitate the campaign against Japan. Rights were granted by King Ibn Baud in order to help the USA in its Eastern war effort and also to develop an important airport in his country. Eventually, the base will be handed over to Saudi Arabia. However, the present contract lasts until February 19, 1949, and contains a clause guaranteeing future preferred rights. No rental is paid by the USA but landing fees based on the size of planes will be charged to private companies' aircraft. The installation is'already complete. Clustered about the HQ building, above which the Stars and Stripes flies side by side with the green banners of Saudi Arabia, are grouped houses and huts, including not only living quarters and offices but a Post Exchange, laundry service, movie house, American Consulate masses and a large terminal building, all of which are air-cooled by a special plant. All officers and men, except the commanding officer are sent to Dhahran for a six- months' assignment after which they can be transferred, if so desired. Nov/ that World War II is over, this base is primarily of value to international commercial transport. However, its potential strategic ....page 2. potential strategic worth is enormous b^51use;of its geo-^ graphical location and indefinite possibilities of expansion, as well as its ability to handle any size of aircraft. The nearby American-owned refinery on Bahrein Island in the Persian Gulf produces 100 octane aviation gasoline which could, if necessary, be pumped directly to the airport by an underwater pipeline. Thus no fuel transportation problem exists even for a large air force. Furthermore, two nearby ports are available for ships whose cargo could be re-shipped to Dhahran respectively by truck and barge from nas Tanura and Bahrein. The Arabian American Oil Co. is planning the construction of a deep-water harbour and port at Dammam, which will be linked to Dhahran by an 18-mile standard gauge railway. This it is expected will be completed by the middle of 1948 and will link the oil fields and airport with the deep-water port at Dammam for freighters. When this is completed, it is believed that Dhahran*s strategic importance - already equal to - will surpass that of Britain’s main airbase. N. Y. Times and Statesman Service.

I very much hope that this suggestion will be pursued. I find that in February 1946 a Royal Air Force party surveyed an aerodrome site at Hamala in the north west corner of the main island, but nobody here appears to have seen their report. I presume the whole question will be considered by the air survey party which is expected here this month vide India Office telegram No. 21999, dated the 21st December, 1946. —» M.l 2. While I was in England I was informed at the Air Ministry that it was desired, if not intended, that the Royal Air Force should evacuate Muharraq. I very much hope that the Royal Air Force will not do this unless the British Overseas Airways Corporation are willing to take over. I have been told that it is the policy of the British Overseas Airways Corporation not to accept respon sibility for the maintenance and management of land aero dromes and that they expect the government of the country concerned to do this. I do not consider it possible, even if'it were desirable, for the Bahrain Government to take over responsibility for any aerodrome here, at any rate for some time to come. A similar situation exists at Salalah and Masirah.

One of the advantages of the transfer of the Residency to Bahrain has been speedier communica tions and it would be lamentable retrogression if these were to be taken away. Further, the Oil Company here, commercial firms and general public should be given every possible consideration in the matter of air services. Grateful therefore if I could be informed what provision there will be for carriage of air mail and passengers from Bahrain after the withdrawal of the '‘C 1 ’ class flying boats.

As explained to you during your stay in Jedda experience shows it is essential for aircraft operating between Jedda and Riyadh to be able to continue flight tu Dhahran or Bahrein without (repeat without) landing because weather conditions often prevent any possibility of landing at Riyadh. 2. It is not a question of keeping stock of fuel at Riyadh but of aircraft's ability to continue flight to a safe landing ground without landing at Riyadh. 3* In view of the fact that Avro 19 cannot do this, I regret that type of aircraft must be ruled out as un suitable for internal civil aviation purposes in Saudi Arabia. 4.

He is said to have warned the King that internal Saudi Arabian services only were not (repeat not) a paying proposition but that T.W.A. would operate them if the King insisted. He pressed for service with Cairo and suggested that other neighbouring capitals beside Cairo should gradually be brought into the network. 3. The proposed operating company would be technically Saudia Arabian but share if any of the Saudia Arabian Government or local private capital in this enterprise was to be left for later discussion. 4. Ibn Saud has asked General Wilson to come to terms with Egypt etc, first. He wants of course to see-2 see what His Majesty's Government have to offer. 5. I have explained that our offer of AVRO 19 aircraft is likely to be reviewed because of the question of range but have asked the King to be patient for a few more days, to sec whether His Majesty’s Government has any alternative suggestion to offer. 6. The Saudi Arabian Government specifically state that aircraft of lesser range than 1,600 (half 5,200) miles, are of no use for the purposes of internal civil aviation in this territory* 7.

I believe that at least one of these is in existence and in any case would be required even if larger aircraft were used. parallel can be drawn with early development of our Empire routes where unoccupied landing-grounds were provided between stages for use in bad weather or an emergency.

The united States Government could h-ardly expect His Majesty's Government or other Middle East Governments to consider this request as anything less than economic imperialism of most kind.

We do not, however, favour proposal that as soon as United States Rrmy control comes to an end airfield should be taken over by an American company and we would instead advise Saudi Arabian Government to sign the Interim Chicago agreement so as to be able to invoke the assistance of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation in maintaining and operating air fields until the Saudi Arabians themselves are fully competent to take over. We are explaining our views on the above points to the United States Embassy here. 3. Rs regards 'Fifth Freedom' rights, Ibn Saud is aware of the reasons why His Majesty's Government do not favour a system under which countries would grant each other unrestricted Fifth Ireedom rights. He has 61 so heard the Americans advocating their theory of unlimited Fifth Freedom. We feel that he should I. POL. B£PT. | 2 2 ■ ! INDIA u exercise/- 2 - exercise his own discretion in choosing between the two theories, and we have no intention of pressing him one way or the other. He should, however, bear in mind the fact (explained in our telegrams Nos. 315 and 425) that,not only Saudi Arabian interests (e.g. ^ie possible future establishment of a Saudi Arabian air line for transporting pilgrims), but also those of neighbouring ^rab countries are vitally affected. The latter indeed are affected to.such an extent that we think Ibn Saud, if he is contemplating acceptance of the American proposal, should consult his neighbours before he commits himself.

Repeated to British Middle East Office Cairo No* 165, Washington No.. 1166 Saving. 11111 IMPORTANT SPACE Your telegram No* 181 [of October 20th: civil aviation in Saudi Arabia]: paragraph 1. Potential requirements for air transport in Saudi Arabia are inevitably at the present time a matter of speculation. In these circumstances it seems wise to start in a comparatively small way and to establish a modest unit in Saudi Arabia on a sound administrative and technical basis on which something larger could be built as the need arises. One of the most important functions of the unit would be to provide training for Saudi Arabians both in the air and on the ground*. 7e regard this offer as mpre practical than that of Ansons without maintenance or training facilities. 2. In these circumstances our proposal is that a unit should be established on Jedda airport with one twin-engined aircraft probably an Avro XIX which could be used for ad hoc flights to Riyadh, Port Sudan, etc. We should do our best to provide additional aircraft and personnel during the pilgrim season, particularly for flights between outside points and Jedda. In addition, we would propose to supply two Moths for local flights and for training purposes. We should also supply the necessary personnel both air ahd ground including a senior pilot of first class ability to take charge of the unit. We would be prepared te supply additional aircraft if. it became clear from experience that the traffic warranted such increase* 3. His Majesty's Government are prepared to bear the whole cost of the unit for an initial period of 2 years, after which the position would be reviewed. It would be advisable to explain verbally to Ibn Saud that we do not think that there would be room for two units and that we should not contemplate paying for the unit beyond the initial period of 2 years if it became exposed to uneconomic competition, X# We feel that in presenting this scheme to the Saudi Arabian authorities it would be useful for you to have an air expert'with you. Ministry of Civil Aviation are arranging this urgently. o.« P.~ 2 - (d) King vail convert nett suns due to and (on request) funds of the Company from rials into United States dollars at official exchange rate of 30 cents a rial.

Summary of specific contract of operation however speaks of the requisition of five (half ten) aircraft. (f) Cost of aircraft and related equipment is estimated at dollars 414,375. Operating costs include without T.W.A, fees dollars 200 per plane per mensem or dollars 2 per flying hour whichever is the greater. Total operating costs for four(half eight) aircraft estimated as follows, in dollars: (1) Monthly cost 95,934 or per annum 1,151,208. (2) Cost per hour 257. (3) Cost per mile 1.61.

If I do not receive comments from you by December 20th i propose strongly to advise the Saudi Arabian Government to consult neighbouring urab territories before signing anything* T.W.xx. proposals seem designed not only to put 3.O.K.C. out of action here but also to make Saudi Arabia a centre of T.W.A. activity damaging to individual and regional civil aviation developments.

[Begins] M His Majesty was grateful to the British Government for the frank expression of their views on T.W.A. proposals. He would as always, be guided by the wishes of His Majesty’s Government and we could be assured that fifth freedom rights would not be granted and that no agreement would be concluded without prior consulta tion with His Majesty's Government. But His Majesty's Government’s expression of views had been entirely negative. This country was badly in need of transport services of all kinds and was in this respect considerably behind neighbouring states. Even Koweit and Bahrein had better communications ? internal and external, than Saudi Arabia, His Majesty was disappointed to find [grp* undec. ?we were] constantly preventing him from accepting offers of improved communications (see e.g. His Majesty s Minister's telegram No. 20 Saving) without offering any alternative. As we knew, he would prefer British services to any others but if these were not forthcoming he would be obliged to look elsewhere.' Yusuf Yasin enlarged upon this saying that Britain was the power most interested in the Middle East and could therefore be counted upon to give good services here. The Americans were entirely commercially-minded and if they could not make money here they would turn their attention to other countries, 2. Yusuf Yasin then informed me confidentially that meetings with T.W.A. representative and United States Minister had been held and that the former had been asked to submit detailed proposals [Ends]4 L *‘7?. ■?&gt;o~i t ■*&gt; 4 -O.X. &lt;NDEXEO ^ v v *&gt; c ' FILE COPY A 4542 [This telegram is oV-pai Liil5aL'i. ^ „„ * ^ by the authorised recipient and not passed on] [CYPHER] SPECIAL (CIVIL AVIATION) FROM JEDDA TO FOREIGN QFl^ICE D.

The second development reported is the form of application by T.f.A. representative, Nicholls, now in Cairo to negotiate air services in Saudi Arabia.

In addition to the construction^ the United States feel that it will he necessary to maintain and occupy this airfield and related facilities for a tern of years # after the conclusion of the present war. In this connexion flying rights over Saudi Arabia are needed, along with uermission for American military forces to locate, construct maintain and remove necessary navigational aids, also one emergency field in Central Saudi Arabia. It is hoped that American'Civil Airlines will he permitted to operate on Dhahran airfield and to construct there such facilities as they may reasonably require. Such air lines would need transit rights in Saudi Arabia plus commercial entry at Dhahran, and these rights and entry should continue on a non-discriminatory basis as long as any commercial air services operate in or through Saudi'Arabia, Kore detailed provisions regarding American commercial air transport services may be the subject of a subsequent agreement.

I have pointed out to them that it had clearly been understood between State Department and the Embassy that request of Ibn Saud which His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda was to support was for facilities for a military air field only for the needs of the war in the Pacific, I added that a most painful impression in London had been created by the fact that requests for facilities for civil aviation and other purposes were made without our being informed, and in such a way that ouryloyal backing of request for military facilities was thus made to appear to Saudi Arabian Government as covering other xmierican requests, 2. Near East Division of State Department have expressed their regret. They explain that matter had previously been handled by filing who had left for San Francisco Conference when instructions to United States Minister at Jedda were drafted. The matter was one which concerned two Divisions of State Department, the Near East Division,and Civil aviation Division and addition to instructions was made by the latter. Had Mlling, who particularly regrets what happened, been in Washington, matter would have been fully discussed with us here as at all previous stages, Ms it was, officers who had not been sufficiently briefed themselves on past history of question, failed to inform us* 3, Mt the same time, Near East Division says that locally the Civil aviation Division are (as we know) disturbed at what they believe to be tendency of His Majesty's Government to oppose Americans' requests for civil aviation facilities in Middle East countries. (See my telegram No, 4-667 and previous correspondence). They feel that until we can secure a fuller understanding and if possible come closer to an agreement on this problem, we shall continually find ourselves at cross 4 purposes- 2 - '• t- ' ' purposes. They have specially asked whether we will consider^discussiug the matter with State Department at a sufficiently high level to ensure that advice of political departments as well as.of.Civil Aviation.

The question of His Majesty*s Government*s response to I bn Saud s request for advice on xnerican proposals of May 10th was raised again on June 22nd when deputy Minister for Foreign oxiu 1 ? 3 showed on the King*s instructions the note of June 20 th Iran cy United States colleague about American assistance to Baud Arahia. . . . 2. The note referred to two types of assistance: (a) subsidy t (b) long term economic collaboration. It said that Ame ican aid under subsidy could not be defined until 2 or 3 weeks after June 30th owing to legislative processess, necessary renewal of Lend Lease act. The note contained no (repeat no) reference to His Majesty*s Government or to the joint nature of the subsidy. As to (b) in which President Truman .was said to share the late Presidents deep personal interest the note stated that review of possiblities necessary to enable definite proposals would not be complete before 1946. _ . . a. By ’'long term economic collaboration the deputy Minister for Foreign jiff airs explained that the Americans meant large scale developments, e.g. 31 Kharj agricultural scheme. Apparently General Royce brought some message from Roosevelt about such collaboration. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was vague on the details, possibly through ignorance. 4. He said that my United States colleague had explained orally that the suggestion of making the American proposals of march 10 th subject to the execution by an /mi eric an military mission was put forward because Jar Department sponsored activities were npt cramped by legislative red tape and could become effective without delay c.f. 2 (a) above.

' 2. •‘•As regards airfields this policy runs contrary to Chicago Agreement which envisaged that countries should designate a particular airfield or airfields for the common use of the international air services of all countries, and should not grant leases of airfields for the exclusive use of the Airlines of any particular country. You should therefore make it clear to Ion Saud that we greatly hope that there will be no question of granting exclusive rights at Dhahran to ,the Americans. We should almost certainly desire to claim equal rights with the Americans to use any civil airport established in Saudi Arabia even if it were to be built exclusively by American labour and at American expense for war purposes. Other Powers interested in civil aviation might also wish to enjoy similar facilities. Result therefore of giving the Americans any rights of civil aviation will probably eventually be to establish an international airport at Uhahran. Designation of Dhahran or some other airfield in Saudi Arabia as an international airport would be in full accord with recognised international practice, and if Ibn Saud feels that such a course would benefit his countiy we suggest that he should announce that this is his intention. 3. As regards the nature and extent of rights to set down and pick up traffic at designated airports, you are aware that there was at the Chicago Conference a fundamental difference, which still exists, between United States and British views over the exercise of the Fifth Freedom, i.e. the right to pick up and set down traffic not, repeat not, /embarked.......embarked in the country whose nationality the aircraft possesses, Americans desire conditions 'which v/ould allow unrestricted freedom to engage in traffic of this nature while we maintain that the^ right of main trunk operators to carry such traffic must-be regulated in accordance with a code of defined principles if legitimate rights of local and regional operators are to be safeguarded and order in the air maintained. Thus His ilaiesty s Government greatly hope that the King, if he decides to negotiate any civil aviation agreement with the .umericans, would be very careful no? to agree to any iimerican proposal which would grant without reservation rights to American airlines to pick up and set down traffic or to monopolise the carriage of traffic to and from Saudi ^rabia. The civil airlines of other countries including British airlines, are entitled to have their diaims to similar rights recognised. Neighbouring Moslem States such as Egypt and Iraq will no doubt wish to operate airlines to Saudi Arabia (e,g* for the pilgrimage) and will not relish this local traffic, which is really the legitimate preserve of these airlines, being cornered by United States airlines.

I should welcome an early indication of your views lor communication to His Majesty who appears much upset by the whole episode. He is alleged to have exclaimed.- now that Berlin has fallen, they turn on me'.-3- 9#, I consider that the Americans gravely prejudiced the prospects of acceptance of Dhahran airfield request by the^ extravagant terms suggested and by linking it with their civil aviation ambitions and with other projects* However beneficial some of these may be to Saudi Arabia when separately considered, they appear as a comprehensive and provocative movement for expansion of American influence in Saudi Arabia when presented en bloc as the proposed activities of a military mission*. 10*. The Americans also compromised this legation by packing so much dynamite into a communication for which on your instructions I had in advance requested the King s favourable consideration*.

It arises out of a telegram from the Joint Staff Mission (Flag ’B’) setting out the request of the United States Chiefs of Staff for British concurrence to the construction of an airfield at DHAHRAN in SAUDI ARABIA. (A map is at Flag ’S*). The paper suggests that the Chiefs of Staff should concur wilJi the American proposal and assumes that the Americans will be responsible for works services and labour connected with the project. It states that the Foreign Office agrees with this policy. It uoes not however appear that the India Office has been consulted. In view of telegrams which have recently passed between the Secretary of State for India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on a parallel case, (Flags ’C’ and ’D’) the India Office may well raise objection to the Americans becoming associated in work which has hitherto been a British monopoly and to an increaso of American dock labour in the Persian Gulf. It is understood that the construction of an airfield at DHAHRAN will lead to an increased lighterage commitment in the Persian Gulf. All civil lighterage in this area is at present * controllexl and operated by a British commercial firm and the . Secretary of Gtntd for'India Von%ider£ A ±t to.Jbe in o.ur interests 'that this state of affairs shall continue. (Flag , C , ). Owing to recent increases in the military export programme from BAHRAIN, it is unlikely that this firm can spare either craft orc &gt; personnel for any new coiruaituent* Thus the construction of an airfield at DHAHRAN will result in either (a) the introduction by the Americans of their own lighterage craft and personnel or (b) the release from the British .Army of supervisory personnel and the despatch of additional craft to the Persian G-ulf to assist the British firm in undertaking this additional commitment. The Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf is not anxious to encourage an increase in American dock labour, which he thinks may add to existing difficulties in policing and jurisdiction CFlag 'B’)* I suggest therefore that the India Office should be consulted before the despatch of the telegram at Annex. In order not to prejudice any negotiations in regard to civilian air lines which may take place in the future, I suggest that the first sentence of the draft telegram at Annex should be amended to read '‘we concur with United States proposal to build a military airfield at DHAHRAN'*. Subject to the concurrence of the India Office and to the above amendment to the draft telegram at Annex, I recommend that the Chiefs of Staff should approve this paper. The War Office. 27 Liar 45.

If there is no airfield, # i.e. if land is converted to another purpose, the question will no longer arise and the United States Government will have no further interest in the matter.

Field at Bahrein is unsuitable for heavy air craft because of the soft character of the soil ^ U^ted States authorities wish to secure permission from Saudi Arabian Government to construct a field at Dhahran and to fly planes directly across Saudi Arabia. Direct flight would save about 220 miles. (c) United States military authorities are taking up the matter at once with Combined Chiefs of Staff as being necessary for the prosecution of the war m the Pacific.

The greater part of it is situated : o.n land already owned by the. Company, though landing strips have been extended beyond this area into an area;which the Company now wish, to acquire. (See paragraph 2 as to this). I have reason to believe that the Company would if necessary be prepared to agree that the Americans should continue to have the use of the Ybadan airfield for the duration of the Japanese war. But the Company clearly cannot be. expected to guarantee such rights in perpetuity^'if only because it is probable that developments of the[defining plant and housing requirements will make it necessaryrto build over the landing ground after the war. The area ;; immediately adjoins the Company’s existing plant and there is no other direction in which they can expand, since the plant on all- other sites is bordered by branches of the refinery. 2. -. The Company applied to the Persian Government last April under the procedure for acquisition of land* laid down' in its concession, and were surprised and disturbed to find that their application had been held up on account of intervention by the Uni.ted States Embassy-and the United States Persian Gulf Command. - • • 3. It should--be pointed out that transfer of the YLand to the Inglo-Iranian Oil Company would not affect legal title^to the structures erected on it by the United States authorities. Separate ownership of land and of standing properties is recognised by Persian law, and the Americans have acquired no title to the'land, and as far as we are aware have, no intention of acquiring any such title. The Company therefore* hope that the American Government will withdraw their opposition to the acquisition of this land, which they maintain is a matter/..r r &gt; ' V* ~ 2 ~ raatter between themselves and Persian Government.* This seems to ns a perfectly reasonably fdbij^’st f ^#pb-i^t-icnl8rly in view of the facilities which tiie Company have already placed at the Americans .disposal* Please speak to Berle on the above lines, 3* As regards Bhahran, yon will have seen correspondence between Air Ministry and Royal Air Force delegation terminating in Webber W 8854 of October 14th, and also earlier correspondence with His Majesty*s Minister at Jedda (see his telegram No. 157 of May 10th, copied to you in my despatch No. 655). Dhahran is an emergency landing ground which the Royal Air Force is authorised to use in an emergency. H.Q.R.A.F. Middle East have no knowledge of any survey of this landing ground having been carried out recently-by British authorities. The reference may be to a recent visit made there by Superintending Engineer of the Persian Gulf accompanied by Staff Officer of Royal Air Force Headquarters; this was a. routine inspection to ascertain if the airfield would be suitable if necessary for the diversion of heavy type aircraft from Bahrein. ' • 6. You should not (repeat not) say anything to Berle about correspondence between Air Ministry and R.A.F.• delegation, pending an approach from United States military authorities. But you may inform him of the position as regards survey party on the above lines. You should add that His Majesty’s Government have of course no intention- of trying to pfevent the United States Government from obtaining post-war air facilities in the Persian Gulf area in accordance with the provisions of whatever international convention is agreed upon. 7. It would be useful if you could make this communication to Berle before he leaves for Chicago. You should explain that it was drafted before receipt of State Department’s note contained in your telegram No.- 5702, which is now being considered here'. 8.

On October 3rd A.O.C.

Meanwhile, matter has been considered here/under following heads (a) Our transport interests * Air Ministry consider that it would be advantageous to have large relief aerodrome of this kind provided it did not add to our maintenance difficulties in the area. Same relief could, however, possibly be afforded at perhaps less cost by Americans developing Abadan. As regards Bahrain, trouble is at present being experienced with use of runways by heavy aircraft, though by use of steel planking it is hoped that airfield will be fit ^ h^C/tvy for use /by February next. * To provide full length V.H.B. runways however, at Bahrain, would be major undertaking of many months and airfield would meanwhile be largely out of comnission. (I am replying separately to your express letter No.c/209 °f 30th August in this eennoot.ioft$ y - /(b)2. (b} Constructional Aspect . Owing to other liabilities in Middle East and Persian Gulf region it would probably be impossible for Aijn Mi w ti ,ll *''ff T * ft Americans would have to do it themselves and at their own charge* (c) The American case . The Americans can probably make a good military /i A - 1 0 a^A'Va'w case for building a heavy bomber airfield though it is doubtful whether they could justify provision of V*H*B. airfield* The northern route via the Azores OuJ) is being developed and will be much more heavily used than hitherto. It is possible, however, that developnent of Abadan may suit them as well for practical purposes* (d) The Political aspect . It is considered that only circumstances in which H.M*G* should endeavour to assist the Americans to overcome Ibn saud's probable reluctance to permit the construction of new airfields in his territory would be if the construction of such airfields were essential to the war effort* It -should- therefore be considered whether facilities already existing at airfields in the Persian Gulf area are sufficient without the provision of a new airfield in Saudi Arabia. It would probably be desirable to advise* Ibn said that he should request an assurance that the airfield would revert to his ownership after the war* H' You will see that the matter has not yet reached a definite stage and if you have any observations on the political aspect I should be glad to receive them. It seems not improbable that if the Americans in fact constructed an airfield at Dhahran in accordance with their own requirements they would cease to use Bahrain to any appreciable extent.

Washington telegram No. 5529 since received, throws some new light on the proposal, and makes it appear that the Americans have put forward their suggestion rather with the idea of having a permanent air field at D^hahran which they can use after the war.

As far as we are aware the existing-routes will be capable of handling the flow of, hi hcraft to the Par Eastern front and there 'therefore appear to be no immediate military rledessity for these airfields. On the other hand, they are 1 likely to be useful to Americah,oil company whose operations are in themselves of some' importance to war effort. Ibn Saud may also think that the construction free of charge of modern airfields in his territory may facilitate, internal communications. If so, he might CBj?e to stipulate that all construction and-installations shall become Saudi-Arab!an property at the termination of the war. .... 2.

M # S # 0 # (Orig).. P.U.S,-I attended a meeting at the Air Ministry on this subject this morning. The Air Ministry explained that the stretch between Egypt and Karachi was at present a bottle-neck on the transport route to the Far East, that the position had recently been v/orsened owing to a^ i*^***^ programme put forward by the Americans, and that any Improvements on this stretch designed to ease the flow of aircraft would be valuable on military grounds. As alternatives to the construction of an airfield at Dhahran there were possibilities of improving the airfields at Abadan or Bahrain. Ite latter was already of adequate size but the surface was not good enough for very heavy bombers at the moment and was in course of being improved. It would probably be quite impossible for us to undertake the construction of an aerodrome at Dhahran at present without dislocation of our construction plans in other parts of the world. It was agreed that if the present American proposal went through they would have to be allowed to undertake the complete construction them selves. I said that from the India Office point of view it was not so objectionable that the Americans should perforin constructional work on aerodromes in, for example, Persia or Saudi Arabia, as in the Persian Gulf States. As regards the latter we thought it most important that the work should be done by us ourselves. The Foreign Office said that they v/ould be prepared to put the proposal to Ibn Saud with K.I. .G.'s support if the Americans could make out a sufficiently good case, though Ibn Saud might well be unwilling to agree, if we were to go by his attitude on the previous occasion. The Americans might, therefore, be expected to explain to us in detail the military reasons which they have for /their2 their proposal. This would make them show their hard. From the India Office point of view I said that while in general we disliked the Americans gaining any additional foothold in this part of the world, we should probably be not altogether averse to their present proposal regarding Dhahran, if this meant that they would cease to use Bahrain and Sharjah- to any appreciable extent. The Air Ministry confirmed that this would be the probable result of the construction of an airfield at Dhahran. that department considered that it should be made clear that the ownership of the airfield should revert to Saudi Arabia at the end of the v/ar. It was agreed that this point might be suggested to Ibn Saud and that we might ourselves mention to brought out at the meeting might be made in a brief to t sfrd- afterwardsTwe agreed that Jeddah should be informed of the proposal as soon as the military justification for it had been cleared up. I suggested that we might at the same time inform the Political Resident of what was afoot.

I learn that when General Giles visited Ihn Saud at Riyadh on July 25th, he informed King that he Giles would be submitting an official request to His Majesty in the near future for authority to fly American planes direct from Cairo to Bahrein thereby passing over Saudi territory. He added that certain intermediate airfields would be necessary and he hoped His Majesty would give favourable consideration to this request. The King in reply stated that establishment of new routes raised international complications and that he might also have difficulty with his own people who of course he knew better than any foreigner. He; requested application should be put in officially. I gathered* from Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty is unlikely to accede to American request. General Giles claimed it would shorten the route to India and assist the Allies in their war effort in the Far Mast.
