Until the export of grain is permitted, trade must languish, but if the prohibition is withdrawn, there is certain to be a marked and rapid revival of trade, as the condition of the country is undoubtedly fairly pros perous, and, owing, no doubt, to fall in prices, crime of all sorts has apparently decreased, the routes to the interior being safer than they have been for some time back. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Persian Government' will shortly remove the prohibition, and permit the exportation of food-stuffs. The Governorship of JBushire. —The Darya Begi has held the Governor ship during the past year, and our relations with him have throughout been friendly. Public Peace and Tranquillity. —The past year has again been remarkably free from violent crime, and there is little to record in this respect. On the 29th of April the Persian post was attacked near Shiraz and plundered. The robbers were, however, intercepted and the mails were recovered. On the 27th of May the Persian post was attacked near Dalaki by a party of Tangistanis, who carried away the parcels, but not the letters. The robbers exchanged shots with the mail guards, one man being killed on each side. A third attack was made on the Persian post near Shiraz, early in November, when a considerable amount of money and supply bills are said to have been taken. I have not heard if anything has been recovered in these two last cases. Beyond these isolated instances, the road between this and Shiraz has been free of serious crime.ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Public Health and Measures to prevent the Introduction of Plague and Cholera into the Persian Gulf. —The past season has not been altogether a healthy one, as plague appeared at Bushire, and there were severe outbreaks of cholera during the summer at Gwadur and Maskat, to both of which places the disease appeared to have been brought from Karachi, where it appeared in a severe form in May, June, and July. Subsequently cholera broke out at Basrah, and reports were received of occasional cases in various parts of Arabistan. It has disappeared entirely in this part of the Gulf, and no cases occurred at Bushire itself, but it still lingers on the Oman Coast. Plague was discovered at Bushire in the beginning of June, and there is reason to think that there were several cases before that, as the death-rate was considerably above normal during the lime that it is supposed to have been present. It will be seen from the statement given in the margin that for tlie month In June 1899 there were . . . 53 deaths. ^ Jtme the ICpOrtcd deaths, fl'Om all 37 „ causes, were 53, that in July they had 40 ;; fallen to 37, and in August to 31. In the 41 „ three succeeding months there was a slight 36 ;; r i 8e &gt; probably due to change of season, July August; September October November December January February fell again, and the avei 20 18 and fever in consequence; but in Janu ary and February, the number of deaths rage death-rate for Bushire appears to be about 34 per mensem, or 408 per annum, which, as the population of Bushire is supposed to be about 20,000 souls, gives an annual death-rate of 21 per mille. These figuies are only approximate and not reliable, no census having ever been taken, and all deaths certainly not being reported. The information we now have will, however, probably be useful in future, should any abnormal rise in the death-rate indicate the presence of plague or other disease. The summer heat put an end to the plague, of which no suspected cases have been heard of ^ rm e of July, and Bushire was formally declared free of plague on the 2/th August last. r 0 There was a good deal of sickness in Bushire amongst Europeans towards the close of the hot weather, and several cases of fever of a malignant type occurred. There were, however, no deaths amongst adults except in the case o i r. Campbell, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who succumbed to an attack of fever on the 12th September. Mr. Campbell's early death was a great loss to the small European community of Bushire. Plague ttiots at 7iW«re.—AVhen the Residency Surgeon discovered early in June that plague had appeared in Bushire, he recommended that measures should be taken with the object of stopping its spread, and, if possible, stamp- Rfin ^r I M S^n ^r er : bad alread y ^ed a footing, 'captafn • ' vo Assistant burgeons were deputed from India to assist m the preparation of a scheme and in its execution, if approved, by the Persian Government The knowledge of these measures, while in contemplation' and at re' nd er o a f T ?

Currency. —I regret to say that nothing has been done to improve the currency of Southern Persia which remains in the unsatisfactory condition noticed in my report last year. The « Bijecks ' or notes issued bv the Bushire Trading Company, having partly been called in, there appears to be some prospect .of the Bushire Trading Company being eventually put an end to. Arrangements of the Custom House. —I reported last year the assumption j i P eiia ^ -^ an k of Persia of the management of the Bushire Customs and. the subsequent withdrawal of the Bank control in consequence of the repayment by the Persian Government of the loan made by the Bank. Since then the Customs have been farmed by the Darya Begi. On the 21st of March 1900 the control of the Customs were taken under direct management, being worked by Belgian officials serving under the Persian Government. It is stated that they will not, at first, enhance the rate for native-owned goods, or interfere with vested interests, and if this is the case, the new arrangements may turn out satisfactory and increase the revenue of the Persian Government, without exciting much opposition. Settlement of Claims for Compensation, —I regret to report that, in spite of incessant efforts, we have been able to do very little towards the settlement of the numerous claims against the Persian Government on the part of British subjects and proteges, some of which have been pending for years. I have addressed the Government of India and Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran on this subject. Tours during the year. —After my return from Maskat and Bahrein in the beginning of March 1899 I remained at Bushire till the middle of August, when I was allowed to go to Karachi, from which 1 returned on the 20th September. In October I went to Bahrein, and at the end of that month left lor Ahwaz, where I met Her Majesty's Minister, Sir H. M. Durand, who had travelled down from Tehran to inspect the Ahwaz-Ispahan route. Soon after wards I started on a tour along the Arab Coast, visiting Bahrein a second time, and meeting nearly all the Trucial Chiefs and the Sultan of Maskat. On my return journey I visited Bunder Abbas and Bassidore. I have recently paid a short visit to Mohammerah, and saw Sheikh Khazal and Mr. McDouall, the Vice-Consul. 2.—OMAN—MASKAT. Major C. G. F. Fagan, I .S.C., was Political Agent up to the 27th September, when he was relieved by Captain P. Z. Cox, who has held charge for the rest of the year. The principal events at Maskat have been briefly as follows:— At the beginning of the financial year, the Sultan's subsidy was being withheld in consequence of certain events which had taken place during the previous year, and payment was not renewed until November; when the B 24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL subsidy for the previous month was paid by Captain Cox, in consequence of His Ilifjhness's improved relations with the British authorities, and the difficul ties which he was experiencing for want of ready money to meet urgent calls upon him. I visited Maskat in December, and was able to recommend the prospective renewal of the subsidy which has been in consequence sanctioned by the Government of India, There have been constant negotiations going on between Her Majesty's Government and that of the French Republic with the object of deciding a site for a French coal-shed in Maskat harbour. This point is still unsettled. The question of the right of certain Maskat dhows to fly the French flag has also formed the subject of much enquiry and discussion of late. No definite arrangement has, however, yet been arrived at, and it is not unlikely that the flag of the French Republic is used to protect those engaged in the slave trade, as well as in the traffic in arms. There has been a considerable importation of nrms into Maskat during the past year, and there is reason for thinking that they are imported thence to Bunder Abbas and other places in Persia as well as to Koweit and various other ports on the Arab side of the Gulf. It has not, up to the present, been found possible to entirely put an end to this traffic, but the measures taken two years ago have undoubtedly reduced it to a very great extent. Maskat and the neighbouring districts have suffered greatly from the ravages of cholera, and there has also been some plague, the first reported cases of which occurred in April 1S99. They were imported, and the disease at that time could gain no foothold in the place. Recently, however, it has re appeared, and it looks as if it would establish itself on the Oman Coast. Every effort has been made by the British authorities to assist the Sultan in dealing with this important matter, and it is to be hoped that the efforts being made will prove successful. Cholera appears to have been brought to Maskat from Gwadur, where it was virulent in July and the beginning of August. There is considerable trade between the two places, and it was not likely that Maskat would eventually escape, though at first it did so. Unlike plague, an outbreak of cholera is, as a rule, sudden and spreads with rapidity from the first, and reports show that the epidemic in Maskat, Mutrah, and the surrounding districts in the interior, was, from the first, a severe one. About 500 deaths are reported to have occurred at Maskat and Mutrah, and it is said that some thousands have perished in the interior. The exact number will, of course, never be known. 3.—OMAN—PIRATE COAST. I was able to visit this portion of my political charge during the winter, and, after interviewing Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani, a brother of the notorious Sheikh Jasim, at El-Wakra, a town close to El-Obeyd, the Turkish head quarters on the El-Hasa peninsula, I went to Shargah and subsequently met the Chiefs of Shargah, Debay, Ras-el-Khyma, and Um-el-Kowain. I did not see the Chief of Abu Thabi as he was ill at the time, but met his sons, and Wazir, or Secretary, with whom I discussed various pending cases in which Abu Thabi is concerned. The most important question pending at present on the Arab Coast is con nected with the expulsion of the Persians from Lingah by Sheikh Muhammad, which was mentioned in last year's report, and the subsequent re-capture of the place by the Darya Bogi. Sheikh Muhammad, and his principal adviser, Saiyid Yusuf, effected their escape and took refuge with their Jowasimi kins men. The Persian Government declare that a fresh descent on Lingah is contemplated by these Arabs, and they have asked us to arrange for the surrender of Sheikh Muhammad and his followers. There is nothing to show that any such intentions exist at present, but the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs complain that, after the re-capture of Lingah, much property of theirs, which had nothing to do with Sheikh Muhammad, was confiscated by the Barya Begi, The matter is still under consideration. A curious case has arisen on this Coast in consequence of the discovery of a pearl of great value in one of the pearl banks near Kumzar. It appears that it was sold by the finders for much less than it realized subsequently, andace ition^N tl0n8 ?oi D? ■Cfl 16 pfg ^iij; IS ^ er places a side etyputi )tedly n reported diseasi er, it Coast. id in iealiw s beiDg niaij Maslat from 'ust.

In September, a serious outrage was committed on some British Indian subjects by the Sheikh s writer, a man named Sharida, who, with his son siZuSr- ll ' , Sl ' ih li ' ,l '»-b..uhj Considerable difficulties have been experienced in the discbarge of cargoes from the mail steamers of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company, and much pilfering of property lodged in the or Customs godown has been complained of. 0 Ag a Muhammad Rahim, our Native News Agent, died at Bushire, where he had come to obtain medical advice, and Mr. Gaskin, Extra Assistant to the Resident and Vice-Consul, has been deputed to Bahrein, as a temporary measure, without vacating his permanent appointment. Aga Muhammad Rahim had done much useful work for the Residency, but he had been for some time in tailing health, and could not attend properly to his duties. V 5.—EL-NEJD. We have heard very little of the state of affairs in that part of Arabia, and I would repeat the observation made in last year's report, recommending that some one should be deputed to travel there and obtain information of what is going on, 6.—KOWEIT. I have not been myself to Koweit during the year under report, but it has been visited occasionally by British men-of-war, and by the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. The Sheikh appears to have enjoyed good health, and nothing particular has occurred. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. I went to Ahwaz in November, and met Sir H. M. Durand, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, who had travelled via Ispahan over the new trade route connecting that place and the Karun river. I was accompanied by Mr. W. McDouall, Her Majesty's Vice-Consul, Mohamtnerah, and Mr. A, B. Taylor, one of the partners of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who had met the Minister on his way, was also present. Various questions connected with the navigation of the Karun and the opening up of the river and land routes were discussed. Sir Mortimer Durand had interviewed all the leading Bakhtiari Chiefs, through whose territory the road passes, and had explained the advantages which would probably result to them and their people from it, when it is once in full use. I gathered that the want of forage is at present an obstacle, and that the muleteers, who are now plying on the Ispahan-Shiraz and Bushire route, are reluctant to adopt a new one, on which it seems doubtful if they will obtain supplies for themselves, and their animals, and protection against attacks by the wild mountaineers who inhabit the Bakhtiari country. After a few days at Ahwaz, Sir H. M. Durand proceeded in the Persian river boat, the Shushan, to Shuster, from which he returned vid Dizful to Tehran. At present the prospects in Arabistan are exceedingly flourishing, and if the embargo on export of wheat is removed, the prosperity of the district should rapidly increase. 8.—PARS AND PERSIAN COAST. The Pirman Firma was succeeded as Governor-General of Fars by the Nizam-ul-Mulk who has remained in power throughout the year.6 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL ■ : I! | 1 111 i fT i I m lf^ J Gulf Forts. —Lin^ah lias remained in the hands of the Persians through out the year, and nothing special has occurred there. We have been endeavour ing to obtain compensation for the losses sustained by the British Indian subjects during the attack on the place, but up to the present no satisfactory settlement has been arrived at, and the matter has been referred to Tehran. Some attention has been drawn of late to the important harbour of Bunder Abbas, and Lieutenant Hunt, I.S.C., has been appointed Political Assistant and Her Majesty's Vice-Consul at that place. Lieutenant Hunt, after landing at Bunder Abbas on his way up the Gulf, came here to receive instructions for starting his Vice-Consulate. He is now living at Bunder Abbas, but will pro bably spend much of his time in the interior, as his Consular jurisdiction extends from Bunder Abbas to Yezd and the trade route will require much attention. 9.—persian baluchistan. There has not been much to record on this Coast during the year under report, but the death of Mowladad Khan, who was murdered in June last has delayed the settlement of our claims for compensation. Mr. Sealy visited the Coast when making his final tour of inspection in December last. He was relieved of his appointment of Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in the beginning of January by Mr. H. Whitby-Smith, formerly of the Indian Telegraph Department, who has recently been up the Gulf in the Fat rick Stewart. Mr. Whitby-Smith is at present visiting the Makran Coast on his way to Karachi, after having discussed all matters of importance with me at Bushire. I have not yet received a report of his proceedings. There have been rumours of an intended revolt against the authority of the Shah in Persian Baluchistan, but no definite information has reached me and I should say that it is doubtful if any combination of the Baluchi will be' carried out. Mir Abdi Khan, of Dashtiyari, whose arrest was reported last year, has returned to his district, and has given assurances of future good behaviour. It is probable that he will be re-instated in the Chiefship, as he is the most influential person in that part of Makran. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. No capture of slaves has been made during the year under report, but several slaves have received manumission from the British authorities. ihe question of a distinctive flag for Maskat dhows is still unsettled. 11.—PIRACY. Four cases of piracy occurred during the year. The vessels attacked were British Indian, Persian, and Bahreini, and the crimes were committed on the Arab Coast, not far from Bahrein itself. Enquiries, I made, showed that they were not, strictly speaking, piratical attacks at sea; but were committed bv Bedouins, and other landsmen, when the dhows attacked were stranded on the toast. A portion of the property taken has been recovered through the instrumentality of the Sheikh of El-Wakra, who promised to endeavour to get the rest. This matter should not be lost sight of. Owing to the efforts of •ah 6 ff i a u Mohammerah, and the presence of British gunboats in the bnatt-el-Arab, there were no cases of piracy in that river or in the Karnn. 13.—navy.

The personnel of the Consular representatives of other European Powers has been completely changeo during the year. Dr. Robert Hauke, the German tonsul, went on leave to Europe in June, and Mas succeeded bv Dr. Reinhardt. who came here from Egypt. Dr. Reinhardt went to Shiraz for'the hot weather and has made a trip to the Karun during the winter. He contemplates pro ceeding shortly on furlough to Europe, and it is doubtful if the post will be immediately tilled up. M. Bryois, the French Vice-Consul, went to France in August, and has not yet returned. The work of the Consulate has been carried on by the Dragoman, Mirza Husain. Mr. H. C. Vander Zee, of Messrs. J. C. P, flotz &amp; Son, who was Consul for the Netherlands at Bushire, has been trans- terred to Ahwaz, Mr. Moesmann, of the same firm, taking his place. 15. —OBSERVATORY.

Ihe object of the expedition was both to punish the marauders and to obtain from them compensation for the losses sustained by these British subjects. The Sultan's intention, however, reached the Beni Katab in time to enable them to enlist the aid of the Naeem and Mokabil clans, and as Suleiman bin Suweilim s force was not strong enough to cope with the above combina tion, the expedition proved abortive. It is satisfactory to note, however that the Sultan has since paid without question the whole of the amount of compen- sation (4131J dollars) claimed by the two Banians. On the 4th Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, the Governor of Semail, reported to the Sultan that he has re-appointed Sheikh Khalfan bin Thenayan, Sheikh and Wali of Nakhl. The Sheikh, who was deposed in 1897 for certain disturban ces referred to in the Administration Report for 1897-98, had eluded the pursuit of the men sent by the Sultan to arrest him and had since continued to make trouble at Nakhl. The Sultan acquiesced in his re-appointment, how ever, apparently because it enabled him to withdraw the 130 Wahabis whom he had sent to garrison Nakhl and whom he could ill spare from Maskat. On the 11th April the inhabitants of Nezwa petitioned the Sultan to recall his Wali on the ground that he was practising oppression and injustice, and a short time afterwards news was received that the community were preparing to rise against the Wali unless action was speedily taken from head quarters. The Sultan, therefore, after enquiry into the truth of the accusations against his official, dismissed him and appointed Sayyid Nasir bin Muhammad in his stead ; the garrison, however, mostly consisting of the relatives of the dis missed Wali, refused to surrender the fort to the Sultan's garrison sent in advance of Sayyid Nasir bin Muhammad, the newly appointed man. The Sultan considering it inexpedient to eject the garrison by force, and being ade quately assured of the future good conduct of the garrison and the ex-Wall, retained them and reinstated the latter and recalled Sayyid Nasir. On the 16th news was received to the effect that Sheikh Suleiman bin Seif er Eiami Sahib of Jebel Akder had been murdered by his nephew Sheikh Hameyr in revenge for the murder of the latter's father and mother some fifteen years before by Sheikh Suleiman. This was followed by the news on the 25th instant of the murder of Sheikh Sultan bin Saeed of the al-Wahibeh by the Jenebeh of the ed-Dahireh in retaliation for non-payment of some blood money due to them. Both these Sheikhs were most influential and exercised great power for good or ill over the tribesmen of the interior. Their exit from the sta^e of Oman politics will have an important etiect in insuring tranquillity in the interior. In May persistent rumours of a rising of Sharkiyeh tribesmen were current; the Sultan therefore increased the garrison at Seeb and re-called all the Wahabi garrison of the Coast towns to Maskat. On the 27th, the Sheikh18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL of the al-Wahibeh having written to the Suitan that should His Highness discontinue to give his tribe their usual presents they would raid on and loot any place they could lay their hands on, the Sultan sent a further re-inforce- ment of armed sowars to strengthen the garrison of Seeb which it was supposed would be the rendezvous of the mal-contents. Nothing, however, occurred till the 22nd July, when a handful of Sharki- yeh Bedouins with the aid of some of the Siabieen, though not strong enough to attack the town and bazaar, raided the house of a wealthy Balooch merchant, killed its owner and looted the premises before the Sultan's garrison appeared on the scene. The latter put the marauders to flight killing four of their number and five camels, while the pursuers had one of their men killed and two slightly wounded. At the request of the Sultan who feared a more serious raid on Seeb, the British subjects were directed to remove themselves with their valuables for a time which they did. His Highness at the same time provided the garrison with a large supply of ammunition. Nothing further, however, occurred to disturb the peace of the place. On the 29th June news reached Maskat that some Bedouins of the Sharkiyeh under the leadership of a notorious robber named Muhammad bin Suleiman Muskaree had committed a raid on the bazaar at Kurriyat, 18 miles south of Maskat, the previous day, and on 30th four British Indian Banian traders arrived at the Consulate and confirmed the news. The Sultan imme diately sent a large force to punish the raiders who, however, had left the place with their loot before their arrival. The claims of the traders after careful verification were presented to the Sultan by the Political Agent on 11th December 1899, and were settled by him forthwith. On the 15th July the Sultan ordered the levy of punitive tax upon the produce brought to coast towns by the Rahbieen who were known to be defeat ing the object of that tax by passing into Matra as their own tax-free produce, the goods of persons under the ban. The Rahbieen thereupon closed Akk Pass to all Kafilahs to and from the interior, and were soon imitated by the Siabieen who closed Khaza Pass in retaliation for the imprisonment of six of their tribes^ men who had shortly before been arrested by the Wali of Kurryat and sent in irons to Maskat. The trade-routes being closed trade came to a practical standstill by which the Customs farmer was a heavy sufferer: he therefore threatened to throw up the Customs farm unless the Sultan arranged to open the roads. The Sultan accordingly ordered Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, the Gov- ernor of Sernail, to arrange for the opening of the passes, which he succeeded in doing by giving the Sheikhs their usual presents. On the 18th July news was received that Wali Suleiman bin Suweilim had been wounded and two of his men killed in a fight with the Mokabil, which had been brought about by the latter refusing to surrender two of their tribesmen who had escaped from confinement in the fort of Sohar. The Moka bil were aided by the Beni Ali and the Wali therefore cut down a number of date trees of the latter. A month afterwards the Beni Ali mustered in great force near Sohar and threatened an attack on Wali Suleiman, and at the same time sent a letter to the Sultan informing His Highness that they have only risen against the Wali to recover the damages done to their date groves, and unless they obtained redress they intended to have recourse to force to compel compliance with their demands. The Wali, however, was prepared for the hos tility of the tribe, and had taken measures to forestall any attack that might be made upon him. The result was that both parties sat waiting their oppor tunity and neither would take the offensive, and the situation became so intoler able to the unoffending public that on 8th September Sheikh Sukkur bin Zaeed bin Khaleefah was persuaded to attempt mediation. Wali Suleiman, however, would brook no interference, and eventually the Sultan hearing of the state of things sent two trusted envoys to counsel Suleiman and get him to put an end to the strife by accepting any amicable arrangement which Sheikh Zaeed might be able to bring about. The latter succeeded in arranging the matter, and W ah Suleiman thereupon left for Maskat to get his wounded foot treated and remained to the end of the year. December a serious brawl resulting in some casualties took place at oeeb between the Awamir and the Beni Hina.

The Bedouins twice looted the supplies sent to an inland fort by the Wali the latter therefore, while sending provisions for the third time, planned an ambus cade and succeeded in killing nine Bedouins when they attacked the convov. This caused the Bedouins to rise en masse against the Wali, but the Sheikhs of Merbat and the well-disposed inhabitants of Dhofar with Shaikh Salim bin Hamed al-Mahrooni who was released last year at the instance of this Ao-encv from imprisonment in Maskat sided with the Naib Wali and supported his action in punishing the evil doers as he had done. The Bedouins in consequence retired, and nothing further occurred to disturb the peace of Dhofar. GENERAL.

J-he Sultan^ at once expressed his regret at the sad occurrence and graciously complied with the representations made by the Commander of Redbreast or compensation to the deceased's widow. A similar accident took place at ^email on the same day when another Wahabee shot a comrade by accident in the same way, D 320 EPIDEMICS. Maskat had been free from epidemic disease for so many years that the community had begun to believe that the climate was proof against any serious outbreak of disease. The events of the past year, however, have rudely dis abused them of the illusion. Cholera after beginning insidiously in Matrah probably early in September was declared epidemic on 30th of that Cholera ■ month, and continued to spread through out Oman until it finally died away towards the end of January. The mor tality in Maskat and Matrah is believed to have been about 600, and in Oman generally it is estimated that 12,000 persons fell victims to its ravages. An interesting report on the subject was drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar, I.M.S., Agency Surgeon, and is attached to this report. Hardly had cholera begun to die out when plague made its appearance. It has never been ascertained satisfac- Flagu0 ' * torily how the infection was brought to Maskat, but as it commenced in the Khoja community who are in constant communication with Karachi, it is probable that it was imported from thence. Maskat was declared Infected on 10th January 1900 and was not declared free of the disease till the 26th May. It is difficult to give any reliable statistics as to the deaths and cures. As in the case of cholera, the disease first went its course in Matrah, and then as it began to die out there, it took root in Maskat. The fact that a severe form of fever and influenza prevailed at the same time, and that the populace generally were very slow to come forward and report their sick, in fact did their best to conceal them for fear of being subjected to undesired attentions of the local authorities, made it difficult to know what amount of the extra mortality was due to plague and what to ordinary fever, but it is probable that many of the deaths reported as suspi cious were really due to plague. Segregation was adjudged to be impossible in a community such as that of Maskat, but disinfection and inoculation were carried on, and the Sultan had hospital sheds built in Maskat and Matrah for such as could be persuaded to use them. Some 400 persons in all were inocu lated with M. Haffkine's serum. The Sultan engaged a medical practitioner from Bombay experienced in plague work together with an assistant, especially to assist in combating this epidemic. He was also arranging to entertain a trained native nurse for the same purpose when happily the advent of Hot- weather brought the epidemic to an end. I am glad to say that, so far as is known with the exception of one or two suspicious cases reported, there was no spread of the disease to the interior as was the case with cholera. NAVY. Maskat was visited during the year by Her Majesty's Ships Figeon^ Bedhreast, Jssayet Sphinx, Lapwing, Melpomene and Pomone. The R.I.M.S. Lawrence also visited Maskat in December 1899. Foreign Navies were represented by the German Cruiser Arcona and the Turkish gun-boat Say id el Daria which touched at Maskat en route for Constantinople. SLAVE TRADE. During the year under review, no slave dhows were captured by any of Her Majesty's Cruisers of the Persian Gulf Squadron. Out of a total of 43 slaves who applied during the year to this Consulate for protection and free dom, 41 were manumitted under the stipulations of the treaty of 1873, one left of his own accord while his case was under investigation, and one was dismissed not being entitled to freedom. Six Africans were given manumission by Lieutenant-Commander Moubray of H.M.S. Pigeon and one by Lieutenant- Commander Travers of H.M.S. Redbreast under the provisions of the Brussels Act, all of whom had taken refuge on board these vessels.

EEPQET ON THE EECENT EPIDEMIC OF CHOLERA IN MASKAT AND MATEAH, WITH A FEW GENEEAL KEMAEES ON THE EPIDEMIC IN OMAN. Although the recent epidemic of cholera may be considered, at least as regards the towns of Maskat and Matrah, to have practically terminated some weeks ago, occasional cases of the disease, though a few only in number, have continued occurring principally in Matrah until lately, so that it is only now* that a sufficient interval has elapsed to warrant the assumption that the disease has died out. This cannot, however, be said in regard to some of ttie distant parts of the province of Oman, to which the disease has only recently extended, and though the danger of its revival in Maskat through a fresh source of infection must exist until the whole province is clear of it, I do not deem it to be so great as to necessitate any further delay in the submission of this report. That Maskat, and for that matter the whole province of Oman, has hitherto enjoyed a considerable amount of immunity from cholera cannot be disputed. The great Arabian Desert which forms one of the natural boundaries of the province and effectually isolates it from the rest of the peninsula, has undoubtedly proved to be a great barrier against the advance of any epidemic disease towards it by land, whilst by sea, which is the only practical channel of communication with the rest of the world, the means of intercourse, which until recently have been principally restdcted to dhows and other kinds of sailing vessels, have been necessarily of a slow nature, thus reducing considerably the chances of a disease like cholera invading Oman. Thus it is that during the nineteenth century Oman has been visited by only three great general epidemics of cholera, including the recent one, and the disease has been imported in every instance by sea. There may have been other limited local outbreaks in some of the coast towns, but they must have been of too insignificant a nature to deserve any record. The first epidemic in the nineteenth century occurred in 1821, and was evidently of a verv Epidemic of 1821. virulent type. There is no mention made any where as to how and whence the disease was im ported, but as it prevailed in an epidemic form about that time in India, the presumption is great that it came from there either directly from Bombay or by way of Sindand the Mekran coast, in both of which places it was then prevalent. Macnamara, in his Article on Cholera Asiatic in Quain's Dictionary of Medicine, says;— ' The disease was communicated from Bombay via the Persian Gulf in 1830-21 and travelled northward, but did not extend into Europe.' ' The great severity and malignity of this epidemic may be guessed from the remarkable suddenness with which death ensued, as is mentioned by Aitken in his Science and Practice of Medicine— ' When the cholera reached Maskat instances are given in which only ten minutes elapsed from the first apparent seizure before life was extinct. ' r^l ul ^ m 1 ma(1 ^ hi® History of the Imams and Sayyids of Oman (translated by tr. 1. Badger), in giving a general description of the disease, also says — ' Some who are seized die at once, others after two or three days: and only a few survive Great numbers in Oman fell victims to it.' The mortality appears to have been very considerable, and the only striking meteorologi cal condition present at the time was the great and almost unsupportable heat, a condition not altogether unusual at the time of the year when the epidemic prevailed. Dr. Ruschenbero-er in his 'Narrative of a voyage round the World during the years 1835, 1836 and 1837 '^quot ing the Asiatic Journal for 1822 as his authority, says that:— ' In June 1821, when the cholera carried off 10,000 of the Sultan's subjects, the heat was almost unsupportable, and the wind was like a flame of fire. At midnight the thermometer stood at 104 . The next great epidemic that swept over almost the whole province was in 1865, and appears Epidemic of 1865. to liave broliei1 out in Maskat on the 20th of May , . a j * rr ^at year.

By the 20th of June there were 600 deaths in Maskat alone, and on Soor on the coast no less than 1,700 deaths had occurred. The disease then extended northward and westward, and had evidently not disappeared from Maskat Provinces on the 27th ^ eptember.

Nor was there any abnor mal circumstance noticeable in connexion with the soil of the place. ^ ^ 0WeVe ^ a /i )t0ri 5 U i S fact thatthe sanitar ^ con( lition of Maskat and Matrah had atwTpd'lf ^ k and J hea P s ot ' rubblsh and putrefying organic matters not unfrequentlv attracted attention both mside the towns and in the suburbs.

What I wrote in 1876 in myMedical topography of Maskat has in this respect come to be true . ' Maskat has undoubtedly been entirely free from the disease (cholera) since then (1865) ; but the sanitation being so very defective, some of the predisposing causes are always in exist ence, and the introduction of the specific poison will excite an epidemic of great virulence and severity.' The first case that made me suspect the probability of the appearance of cholera in Matrah The first cases that came to my notice. Was that of a Sunnee Persian boy named Abdur .... Kahman bin Muhammad, about 12 years of age, living in the Mazi Meya quarter of the town, who was reported to me as having died suddenly on the 19th of September. An inquiry into the cause of his death elicited the fact of his having suffered from vomiting and purging two days previously and of his having been in bad health since then j he was found to be unconscious and to have passed a large watery motion just before his death. This was followed in a few days by the news of the death of a Shia Persian girl, named Mannee, about 13 years of age, living in Jabru, one of the suburbs of Matrah, on the 28rd, from choleraic symptoms, and on inquiry it was ascertained that her young brother, about nine years of age, living in the same house, had suffered from similar symptoms two days previously and had recovered. Some more cases then came to my notice as having occurred within the next few days in the suburb of Jabru. The disease would thus appear to have originated in Jabru to whicti it was at first principally confined, particularly as there seems no difficulty in tracing connexion between the first case, namely, that of the boy Abdur Jaahman, and that suburb, provided the possibility of his having visited that locality or of bis having drunk water from a probably infected source of supply there be kept in view. Besides24 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL when the boy Abdur Rahman died, the epidemic in my opinion had fairly started, though I was ignorant of it at the time. On the 27th of September a case was reported from the hamlet of Mateireh quite close to Matrah but in a direction opposite to Jabru, Progress of the epidemic in Matrah. w hil e the disease was raging in the latter place it appeared also in the Baluchi quarter inside the town wall of Matrah. Most of the houses in that quarter being at the time supplied with water from the same well (named Zarrafee in Jabru) as the one from which the people of Jabru drew their supply, there would seem to have been a more intimate connexion between the two localities than their mere vicinity to each other would suggest. In fact, the history of the first few cases in the Baluchi quarter strongly favours the opinion that the infection was conveyed by drinking water. By the end of the month the disease had advanced to the suburb of Tuyan and other quarters of Matrah, and though at first only a few scattered cases came to my notice from the newly infected localities, the epidemic soon became general and assumed a wider range, so that by the 4th of October it had fairly advanced on its way to the interior, and by the middle of October no part of the town and the adjoining suburbs and villages could be considered free from it. It may be safely asserted that cholera travelled to Maskat from Matrah, the two places ^ ■ ,r , , being 1 in constant communication wi^h each other. Origin and progress of the epidemic m Haskat. Alth S ?ugh abol:lt the end o£ Septcmbf!r 8trong rumonrs were current of isolated cases of a suspicious nature occurring in Maskat, no definite information could be obtained regarding them, and the progress of the epidemic supports the opinion that the disease was directly imported from Matrah, for whilst the epidemic in Matrah attained its climax as judged by the mortality due to it on the 12th of October, that in Maskat did not attain it until the 3rd November, when the disease had fairly entered upon the stage of decline in Matrah. The first case of which any information could be obtained occurred on the 6th of October, in the person of an Arab woman (Nasra, wife of Nasir-bin-Shinein) living in the brokers' quarter in the suburb of Tuyan, which, however, cannot be looked upon as the first centre of infection, for undoubtedly cases had been occurring before that date, but no information could be obtained about them. Besides, the very next day there were three cases, two of which were in two different quarters of the same suburb and the third one in a totally different suburb. These first cases were followed, on the 9th, by a case in the town itself in the Waljat quarter and a group of cases in the Jalali fort. The disease then began to spread rapidly, soon assumed a general epidemic form, and extended to the village of Sadab on the 17th of October, It attained its maximum about the beginning of November, began to decline about the beginning of that month, and finally disappeared about the end of January 1900. Before proceeding to remark on the nature and character of the epidemic I consider it mi. i- -i. * ht i i. j tit i. i t ^ desirable to state the arrangement that was made The limits of Maskat and Matrah adopted for , • , „ u- u r i i • r the purpose of registration. to register cases icgaidmg which reliable informa tion could be obtained and to convey some idea of the suburbs and quarters of Maskat and Matrab, and the villages and hamlets in their imme diate vicinity included in this report. From the first it was seen that unless myself in Matrah and my Assistant at the Hospital in Maskat undertook to obtain all the available information of cases and record it, no reliable data could be subsequently forthcoming for the compilation of a report such as this. I, therefore, decided upon dividing the work by including under Maskat the neighbouring villages of Sadab and Kalbhu and under Matrah the hamlets of Riyam, Mateirah, Falaj and Arbak, and the village of Darseit; and directed 1st class Hospital Assistant Muhammad Hosain to register all cases coming to his knowledge in the first three places, whilst I myself undertook the registration of cases occurring in Matrah and the places included under it. The reason of my grouping these villages and hamlets with the two towns would be clear to any one having a knowledge of their topography, for though they are separated from Maskat and Matrah by small hills they are so close to thena that in a practical point of view they may be looked upon more as suburbs than independent centres of habitation. That the task was not an easy one, cannot be denied, particularly as we laboured under difficulties which in a more civilized place would have had either no existence or would have been overcome by means of more energetic measures on the part of the local authorities It is true that His Highness the Sultan had appointed two officials for the purpose of making an inquiry in Maskat and reporting the cases there to my Assistant, who, however, informs me that the assistance they gave was not as satisfactory as might have been expected and that he had on many occasions to supplement the record through other channels, whilst in Matrah I had entirely from the beginning to the end to depend upon ray own personal influence and exertions to obtain the necessary inform ation. Although these difficulties were not insurmountable as might be judged from the result now embodied in this report, I should have scarcely felt justified in passing their existence over m silence.

Its slow origin is all the more remarkable as in its subsequent advance through the interior of Oman it broke out in many of the places suddenly and wi h great violence. The individual attacks, however, were ZXa P emlC m0S% SUdden aad % any pteHminary Owing to the difficulty of fixing the date of the first case, it would he safer in my opmion to allow at east two weeks for the existence of the disease before the occurrence of the first case which came to my notice; counting, therefore, from that time the epidemic may be considered to have extended over a period of five months. Jud^ino- bv the mortality as recorded at the time, it attained its maximum in Matrah in about' five weeks and in Maskat between four and five weeks from its commencement. The period of decline, however, differed greatly in the two places; in Maskat the decline commenced in about a week irom the maximum period and continued steadily till the disease finally dis- a PPf;ed, Matrah, however, was situated differently, for being in direct communication with the interior and the north-western coast, where the disease was then prevailing, it was more exposed to fresh sources of infection, so that the epidemic was not only later in enterino 1 upon its final stage, but there was also a recrudescence of it about the end of November, which lasted through the whole of December, the final decline not being reached till the middle of January; the total duration of the epidemic in Matrah was thus five months. r lhe epidemic was characterized especially at its commencement by the occurrence of cases in which the illness set in acutely without any previous warning, and though the premonitory diarrhcea was absent in most of them the subsequent algide stage was neither rapid in its supervention nor very severe in its nature. As the epidemic, however, advanced, there was a greater preponderance of cases in which profuse evacuations followed by early collapse formed an important feature of it. In the majority of cases in which collapse was a prominent symptom, its duration was generally short, being only a few hours, but instances of prolonged collapse, though not common, were not entirely absent. Two such cases came under observation and are remarkable in the fact of their having ended in recovery. The first one was that of an African boy who was admitted into the hospital for a severe attack of broncho-pneumonia resulting from influenza; he had just recovered from the severer symptoms of that disease and was scarcely strong enough to sit up in bed when he was suddenly attacked with cholera. The state of collapse which followed, though not rapid in its supervention, was complete at first and only gradually yielded to treatment, so that it lasted for nearly three days. The other case was that of a young pregnant Khoja woman at the full period of pregnancy in the Khoja fort at Matrah; the illness set in gradually with the premonitory diarrhoea on the 8th of November which lasted for nearly 18 hours, and when the choleraic symptoms became pronounced on the 9th, collapse set in rapidly, and on the third day of the disease, that is, on the 11th, while yet in the state of collapse, which, however, was not then of an extreme degree, she gave birth to a still-born child. She remained more or less in a state of collapse till the 14th of November and eventually recovered. Of the other symptoms characteristic of this stage of the disease spasmodic griping pains and cramps in the extremities were neither cooamon nor very severe when present, but great restlessness and a sense of burning in the stomach were more common and constant among the symptoms. The reactionary or febrile stage was mostly of a mild character and short duration, being entirely absent in some of the cases. The temperature among the cases which came under my personal observation was, as a rule, not high, but in two of the cases which were complicated with cerebral meningitis and which ended fatally it continued to be high for a long time. fi N JIIP III 1 luiivif f| f j,.26 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL whilst in one case, which also ended fatally and in which the evacuation stage was immediately followed by a severe febrile stage, the temperature a few hours before death rose to 106-6 P. Suppression of urine in a more or less degree was a very common symptom, but was rapidly overcome in the majority of the cases that came under treatment. The epidemic may, upon the whole, be considered to have been one of only a moderate severity, for whilst, on the oue hand, the incidence of attacks in proportion to the general population of Maskat and Matrah together was in as high a ratio as 5*3 per cent, which was enough to stamp it as one of a very grave nature, on the other it never attained that great degree of intensity as indicated by the rate of mortality, which was its most prominent charac- tei^in its advance through the Simail valley. At Suroor alone the first place of any importance in the interior it visited, it carried away 470 persons out of a population of 1,000 and at Simail nearly a thousand persons out of a population of about 5,000. The total number of attacks in both Maskat and Matrah together may be approximately stated to have been 1,339. Of these 449 took A ^ tliCv8 ' place in Maskat alone, giving a ratio of 4*5 per cent, to the population. Viewed in a racial point of view the greatest incidence of attacks was among Baluchis with whom 1 have also grouped Jotgals who, though racially distinct from them, are socially and in their domestic habits so much like them, that the two cannot be easily separated. Their habitations are mostly in the filthiest localities and themselves most regardless of the commonest rules of personal hygiene, so that it is no wonder that they suffered most from the epidemic. A little more than half the total number of attacks, namely, 240, occurred among them alone. The next in order to suffer were the Africans among whom there were 111 attacks, and next to them were the Arabs who are proportionately a small com munity in Maskat and who had 95 attacks among them. The least of all to suffer were the Indians among whom there were only three attacks, two being among the Muhammadans and one among the Hindus, whilst the Indo-Portuguese, who are, however, a very small commu nity, had no attacks among them at all. This remarkable instance of the almost absolute immunity of the whole Indian community may be attributed partly to the fact of many of them having adopted prophylactic measures and partly to the fact of all their habitations, which are situated inside the town of Maskat, being far away from the greatest centres of infection. Considered in relation to age and sex, adults suffered considerably more than children, the total number of attacks among the former being 406, whilst among the latter only 43, and males suffered slightly more than females, though the ratio of deaths to attacked was much greater among the latter than among the former. There were 214 attacks among males against 192 among females. The localities that were most severely visited by the epidemic were such as contained closely packed and overcrowded huts with the most unsanitary surroundings and as were inhabited entirely by Baluchis or Jatgals or both. Many such spots exist in both the suburbs of Maskat, and it was there that the disease was most rife. Whilst the whole town of Maskat contributed only 99 cases, there were 205 in Tuyan and 83 in Takia. The total number of attacks in Matrah may be approximately stated to have been 890, giving a ratio of nearly G per cent, to the popu/ation. This ratio was slightly higher than in Maskat partly on account of the larger populacion and partly on account of Matrah being more exposed to sources of infection, as explained above. The greatest incidence of attacks was, as in Maskat, among the Baluchis who alone had among them 335 attacks, being more than a third of the total number. The Arabs come next in order, having had 290 attacks among them, or nearly a third of the total number. There were 166 attacks among the Africans and o9 among the Persians. The remaining 40 attacks were distributed among the three Indian communities—Khojas, other Indian Muhammadans and Hindus, Of these the Khojas, though now domiciled here, live aloof from the rest of the population in a separate place of their own, called the Khoja fort and may be estimated to be about 1,000 persons; there were altogether 31 attacks among them giving a ratio of a little more than 3 per cent. Ihe number hen? given is slightly different from that shown in statement 1 m o. VI, as one of the attacks having ooeurred in the person of a Khoja who lived outside the Khoja fort, is excluded from it, whilst two attacks which occurred among the Africans in the Khoja fort are included in it. The other Indian Muhammadans who are principally goldsmiths, carpenters, memons, etc., also live inside the town amidst better sanitary surroundings than those found in the Baluchi and Arab quarters; they had only 7 attaeks among them. The smallest number of attacks, namely, two, was among the Hindus, and it may be noticed here as a strange coincidence that they were the very last two attacks ju the epidemic. Examined in relation to age, the attacks in Matrah were about five times and a half more in adults than in children, the total number among the former being 752 against 138 among t e latter. As regards sex, from an early stage of the epidemic there was a general impression among the people that women were suffering more than men, which is now seen to have been lightly formed, from the statistics the attacks among females, namely, 456, being near y double of those among males (296). This great preponderance of attacks among females occurred principally among the Baluchis and Arabs in localities almost es- ire y occupied by them, and m ay partly be accounted for by the fact that the duty of nursing t e sick generally devolved on the fair sex. It would be needless to reiterate theRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOE THE TEAR 1899-2900. 27 fact that the localities most severely afieeted were those in which the most unfavourable hygienic conditions hoth of the persons inhabiting them and their smroundioo-s abounded Densely-peopled huts with barely any ventilation in them and situated in the vicinitv of graveyards and mounds of rubb.sh and filth including human and other J of decomposition, such as ^ 1' the suburbs of Jahru and Tnyau and the Arvaneh quarter of the town contributed the largest number of victims to the disease.

This ratio of deaths to attacked was slio-htly more than the usually accepted average of 50 per cent, and appears, in my opinion, to 'have been somewhat influenced by the nature of the treatment that was adopted in the majority of the cases, for judging from the result of the comparatively few cases for which medical relief was sought either at the hospital or with me in Matrah, which gives a ratio of only 2S , 8 per cent, of deaths to attacked, there is reason to think that a more favourable result might have been obtained had it been possible to induce the friends of many more of the attacked persons to call for medical relief instead of their trusting to irrational remedies and measures. Even in the case of such of the attacked poi sons a^ were treated by us^ a further reduction in the ratio of mortality might have be&lt; j n looked for had their friends been more prompt in calling for medical relief and more persevering and regular in reporting the progress of such cases, for in many instances it occurred that after the receipt of the first medicine or medicines no further report was brought. The number of deaths in Maskat was 274 giving a ratio of about 61 per cent, to the Deaths in Maskat. attacked and one of 2 7 per cent, to the general population, ihe rates ot mortality in proportion to the attacked among all the three principal classes were very close to one another, the Arabs having had it in the ratio of 63* 1 per cent., the Baluchis 60*4 per cent., and the Africanj 61*3 per cent. The slightly higher rate of mortality among the Arabs may have been to some extent due to the practices of branding and bathing in cold water as remedial measures more commonly resorted to by them than the other races. There were so few attacks among the two indiau communities—the Muharnmadans and Hindus—that it would not be fair to compare the rates of mortality among them with those among the other races. As regards age, the rates of mortality among the gdults and children were much about the same, having been in the ratio of 61 per cent, among the former and 60^ per cent, among ths latter. In a sexual point of view, however, the mortality among men (65*4 per cent.) was by far the largest, that among women having been only 56 , 2 per cent. Although the number of attacks in the village of Sadab, which is principally inhabited by fishermen and lower classes of Arabs, was smaller than in some of the other localities, the mortality in it was proportionately much higher, giving the highest ratio ot 80 per cent, to the attacked. Makalla, inhabited as it is by poor fishermen from Socotra, with only a few attacks, gave also a high rate of mortality, namely, 75 per cent, whilst Takia and Tuyan principally inhabited by Bciluchis were nearly alike in the ratio per cent, of mortality, the former having had 67*4 per cent, and the latter 65*3 per cent. The smallest rate of mor tality in proportion to the attacked was in the town of Maskat itself, which may be accounted for partly by the fact of more attacked persons there having had recourse to our treatment than in any other locality and partly by the fact of tbe people living in it being of a class in better circumstances and therefore better able to command the necessary attendance and comfort. The ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked in Matrah compares rather favourably with that in Maskat and is as near the average rate of Deaths in Matrah. cholera mortality as it can be. There were in all 452 deaths giving a ratio per cent, of 50-7 to attacked against 274 deaths and a ratio per cent, of 61 in Maskat. It is not easy to account satisfactorily for this great difference in the rates of mortality in the two places, situated as they are so close to each other, and I can only suggest in explanation the circumstance of the epidemic taken as a whole having begun and ended in Matrah. It is a well-known fact that during the commencement and decline of an epidemic of cholera particularly the latter cases often recover even without any treatment. Besides, although the hygienic conditions in some of the localities, particularly in the suburbs, in both the places are very much alike, Matrah being much opener has the advantage over Maskat of obtaining more benefit from two of nature's greatest disinfectants li^ht and heat. e 228 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL But notwithstanding this great difference in the ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked in the two places, there was only a very slight difference in the ratio per cent, of deaths to the general population, so that whilst in Maskat out of every hundred persons 2-7 died from cholera, in Matrah 3 out of every hundred persons died from that cause. The greatest rate of mortality in proportion to attacks was among the Persians who live principally in the suburb of Jabru. Next to them in the order of ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked come the IndiaQ Muhammadans other than Khojas, among whom, however, the attacks were so few that it would be unreasonable to compare their result with that of the attacks among the other races in the same manner as it would be unfair to include in the comparison the result of the two' solitary attacks among the Hindus, which beside being so few occurred at a stage of the epidemic when most of the cases recover. Just as the general ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked compares favourably with that in Maskat, so also do the rates of mortality araono- the principal racial classes excepting the Africans who had 8 percent, more deaths amoro- them in Matrah than in Maskat. The Arabs had only 36-6 per 'cent, of deaths against 631 per cent, in Maskat and the Baluchis 52 , 2 per cent, against per cent, in Maekat. The only reason that I can think of in explanation of this great difference is what I have alreadv suggested above when dealing with the general cholera mortality in Matrah. I q regard to age and sex, the ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked was much greater among children than iu adults, and also much greater among men than among women, which latter circumstance is remarkable in the face of the fact that the attacks among men were fewer than amono- women It appears, therefore, that the severity of the disease as indicated by the rate of mortalit * was much greater, as in Maskat, among men than among women. ^ In regard to the localities, the highest rate of mortality actually occurred in the suburb o£ Jabru, the original centra of infection, which is inhabited principally by the two poorest clas —the Mekrani Baluchis and Persian beggars, though the alarming rate of lUO per cent shown against Matiah Haiboui in the statement No. VJ, which circumstance needs a littl explanation as it is likely to give an erroneous idea. The only three cases noted 5;s having occurred in harbour were registered from information received when the dead bodies w ' brought for burial on shore, but as there was no registration of cases occurring on bolrd fT vessels in the harbour no information is available in regard to such cases'as mav have recovered. Nazi Moya and Takia, two of the quarters of the town mostly occuoied b v Africans, also show a very high rate of mortality, whilst the bazar and Kitleh quarters a nd the Khoja fort, in each of which the ratio of deaths to attacked was only 25 per cent sh™, the lowest rate of mortality. In the case of the Khoja fort it may be noted that beside' ho\Z inhabited by a community in good circumstances, all the cases in it were under mv dirpl treatment. * ulieLC As no account of the mode of treatment of cholera adopted by the Arabs of Dmnn v. Treatment. hitherto been given, I think that a short note t the subject may not be considered out of place here. Actual cautery, the great Arab panacea, occupies, as may be expected, a foremost nlace in the treatment ot cholera m the same way as it does now in the treatment of nla»n. n „,i the instrument generally used in carrying out this therapeutic measure is as primit.ve in i^ conception as the measure itself. A small sickle, such as gardeners use, is heated in the fire and with its hack two lines, each about two inches in length, are marked out horizontallv' one a httle above the navel and the other a little below it ; a similar line is then mXd antero-posteriorly on the top of the head in its middle. It ivould seem as if the Arabs are practically aware ot the beneficial effects of acids in cholera, for soon after the above operatL of branding a draught composed of the juice ot three or four fresh limes, about t^o drachms and a Uule Wiiter etven 0 t(f'rT f «*«). - Pi-hful of charcoal aZ and a little water is given to drink; when fresh limes are not procurable, dried limes are pounded w tb a little water and substituted for them. Following this Arab idea, I found the administration of the juice of fresh lime, mixed with a little water and sugar as often as the patient required It a very agreeable and beneficial remedy tor the intense thirst present in the eaily stage of the disease. Ihe safar in the draught acts as an aromatic and carminative but ! fail to see the value of ashes; in fact I should think that the ashes would partlv nentrahze the acidity cf the juice of limes.

W th this view two kinds of cholera p.lls, one with and the other without opium were freely diltS bated, with full directions for use, among-sneh persone as were intelligent enouo -h to make » proper use o them. Several hundreds of these pills were subsequently supplied to His High! uess the hnltan and h.s officials at their request for the purpose of sending them into the interior when cholera broke out there. This was not, however, the course adopted in case of the attacked persons for whom regular relief was songht. There being no specific remedy or plan of treatment for cholera, we thought it best to be guided by the symptoms though in order to assure success this mode of treatment iuvolved great trouble' it bein&lt;* necessary at first to report the symptoms almost hourly or every two hours The plan mos't generally followed was to administer a dose of salol (gr. x) with or without sp. chloroform afier the application of a large sinapism oyer the pit, of the stomach ; this was followed iu about hair an hour by a cholera pill containing the following ingredients, being the formula of the cholera pills sold by McKesson &amp; Robbins, of New York: Pulv. Capsici, Assafoetida, Pulv. Pip. Niger, Camphora a a 4 parts, and Pulv. opii—1 part. In many instances this first dose of salol and cholera pill were found enough to check the vomiting and purging, and it was necessary in only a few cases to repeat 'the dose of salol or cholera pill or both according to symptoms; a third dose had very rarely to be given. Salol in my opinion had a highly beneficial effect in not only checking vomiting, but also in relieving in a charming manner the restlessness and burning sensation when present in a later stage of the disease. In the sta^e of collapse diffusible stimulants such as brandy, ammonia, and ether were principally administered hourly or every two hours or at longer intervals according to the urgency of the case, and the strychnia was administered hypodermically iu some few cases, and by the mouth in a few others with marked benefit. External application of heat to the surface by means of warm water bottles, heated stones or warmed pieces of cloth was also had recourse to for restoring the normal heat of the body. For relieving the suppression of urine calomel in 2-grain doses with or without the extract of Cannabis Indioa was found highly beneficial, and that with dry cupping to the loins and hot watgr fomentations to the abdomen and loins rarely failed to restore the function of the kidneys. The febrile stage was treated on general principles. It may be here noted that whenever a friend of an attacked person called for medicine, he was given in addition to the necessary medicines a bottle containing carbolic acid solution ( 5 per cent.) for disinfecting the dejecta and clothes of the patient with instruction for its use and as to the manner in which the clothes and bedding were to be disposed of on recovery or death. It is true that in the treatment of cholera no particular line of treatment can be always „ , ,, . depended upon for giving the same favourable Result of treatment. i, • result, nor can any given epidemic be taken as the standard of the utility of our therapeutic measures for striving with the disease; still it cannot but be admitted that a certain percentage of cases in a given epidemic when treated on rational principles may recover in addition to the usually accepted average of 50 per cent, of natural recoveries. This is fairly illustrated by the result of our treatment inMaskatand Matrah. The total number of persons who more or less received medical relief from us was 243, out of whom 70 died, giving a ratio of SB'S percent, of deaths to treated, whilst among the remaining 1,096 who did not receive our treatment the rate of mortality was 59 8 per cent, being a little more than double of the former. This great differerce between the rate of mortality among the treated and that among the non-treated becomes still more accentuated if we separate the figures for Maskat where evidently the disease was of a more virulent type as judged from the general rate of mortality, from those for Matrah. In Maskat out of a total of 162 persons treated only 39 died, giving a ratio of only 24 per cent, of deaths to treated, whilst among the remaining 287 persons who were not treated there were 235 deaths, or the alarming rate of Sl'9 per cent. Although the disparity between the two rates seems to be very great, in fact almost incredible, it must be remembered that many of the persons for whom medical relief was sought had probably by the time the relwf could reach them passed through the critical stage of the disease. Under other circumstances, perhaps, 1 should have felt inclined to doubt the accuracy of these figures but coasidering that they have been furnished by an assistant in whom I have perfect reliance for truthfulness and carefulness and who himseif treated all the cases in Maskat, i see no reason to discredit them, though the result 1 personally obtained in Matrah is not nearly as favourable as this. In Matrah out of SI persons treated 31 died giving a ratio per cent, of 88-3 to treated' Whilst among the remaining 809 who were not treated by me the rate of mortality was oi per cent., or nearly the same as the general rate of mortality. But m order to find a correct es i- mate of the value of our treatment we must take the figures only for the Khojas and Hindus / \30 ADMINISTEATION EE PORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL who wore very regular in reporting symptoms as they developed and who were the only t W o communities capable of appreciating in an intelligent manner the value of our treatment, for in the case of the majority of the other persons who were treated no intimation whatever of the progress of the disease was received after the issue of the first dose or doses of medicine. If we, therefore, restrict our calculation to the result obtained among the Khojas and Hindus only, we find that there were only 7 deaths among the 31 persons that received treatm ant giving 1 a ratio of 22-6 per cent, of deaths to treated, whilst among the others that were treated there was a death-rate of 48 per cent., nearly equal to the general death-rate (507 per cent.) and only slightly less than the death-rate (52 per cent.) among the persons that were not treated. Exception, however, may be taken to tlie result among the Hindus being included in the comparison on the ground cf the smallness of the number of the cases among them and the fact of their having been the last two cases in the epidemic, but even if we exclude them from this calculation we have still the highly favourable result of 7 deaths among the 29 Khojas that were treated, that is to say, a ratio per cent, of 34' 1 deaths to treated. When the disease began to assume epidemic proportions, I advised strongly the takino- Prophylactic treatment. of a dose (m. xx) of dilute sulphuric acid in an 4. 4. 4.w -41,r ei °' n . ce ,. 1 ^ ater eve 'y mornir 'g:' a ad it is gratifying to not now that with the exception of two Khoja children in the Khoja f ^rt, none of those who followed this advice suffered fiom the disease, though it must be stated that the maioritv of them at least in Maskat were not directly exposed to infection. The members of the menial establishment of the Political Agent's Office, who were all given a dose of sulphuric acid every morning were, however, differently situated, many of them havino-had cases of cholera in their houses or in their immediate neighbourhood, and although they were thus directly exposed to infection, they all escaped; but their number is too small for the result of the prophylactic treatment among them to be considered of any importance as a test of its value. The other prophylactic measures that were strongly recommended were the boilintr of all water for domestic purposes, and the addition, if practicable, of a littla solution of permanganate of potash to it. Soon after the appearance of the epidemic it began to manifest its influence on the general , population by causing an unusual prevalence of Cholerine or premonitory diarrhoea. diarrhoea. ^ idea can be formed even approxi- ,, i i • j i, i 'i. i. xi x- m i atel 7 of number of such cases as no informa tion could be obtained about it at the time, the people generally looking upon it as a trifling affection and falling to realize the danger of its proving to be a precursory symptom of! much graver disease.

The suddenness of the invasion and the a arming rate ot mortality there caused the people to be almost panic-stricken and to flee in all directions, the infection thus spreading to the neighbouring villages and hamlets and eventually to the town or oiraail itself. The Wadi Beni Ruwaheh being a continuation of the Wadi Simail was directly infested from the latter place, the course of the advance of the epidemic being still in the westerly direction. *rom buroor the disease also advanced in a northerly direction to al-Khode where the first case occurred about the 17th of October, and which then became the centre for the diffusion of the disease to Nakhl on the one hand and to the Batinch Coast on the other. When the disease reached Nakhl firsts the outbreak being mere of the type of cholerine than true cholera, was attended with hardly any mortality, but the second or subsequent outbreak, which occuned about 2U days after the first one, was one of a very severe nature causing 450 deaths and giving the high ratio of 15 per cent, of deaths to population. A remarkable circumstance in connexion with its advance to Nakhl is the fact of its having followed the course of greatest communication, namely, through al-Khode instead of taking the shortest course from Simail over the hills which are a ramification or the Green Mountains. From Nakhl the epidemic advanced in succession to Wadi Muawal, al-Awabi, and ar -Rustak and from al-Khode it spread first to as-Seeb and thence to the whole of the Batineh Coast in a north-westerly direction, the last place to be infected there being Sohar. It spread from the Wadi Beni Ruwaheh in a westerly direction to Oman Proper and also to the Sharkiyeh in which, however, Samad, Rawdeh and other places close to the Simail Wadi were previously infected through the disease advancing direct from Suroor. It may here be noted that the hamlets in the Akk pass through which the caravans passed on their way from Suroor to the Sharkiyeh enjoyed absolute immunity throughout the whole coarse of the epidemic. The disease appears to have spread to Wadi Hatat from Matrah through the village of Rui whilst to Teiwee and Kalhat on the south-eastern coast from Maskat.

I regret to have to state that the statement is incomplete in some respects, but I submit it as it is with the hope of its being able to give a fair idea of the extent and severity of the epidemic in the interior. This enormous mortality was due in a great measure to the intensity ot the epidemic in many of the places it visited in its course, and the determining cause of that intensity is easily found in the general practice which obtains in the interior, of washing the dead quite close to the aqueducts. It must be remembered that with the exception of some of the places in the Sharkiyeh which contain wells as an additional source of water-supply, the principal means of irrigation are aqueducts fed by springs, all the supply of water for domestic purposes being also obtained from them. When a dead body is removed to one of these aqueducts for washing, a breach is made in the masonry of the aqueduct quite close to the place where the body is, and the water allowed to run over it, some of which evidently runs by the side of the aqueduct and eventually pollutes it Cholera germs in abundance had thus an easy access to the water supply of most of the places and gave rise to those sudden and violent explosions which in places like the Simail valley and Teiwee resulted in such alarming rates of mortality. This assumption is strongly supported by the fact that on the .Batineh Coast and at Maskat and Matrah where the supply of water for domestic purposes is drawn entirely from wells and where the dead are washed in houses, far away from the sources of water-supply, the rates of mortality were proportion ately much less, that for the former or Batineh Coast being in the ratio of r4 per cent, and for the latter or Maskat and Matrah together 2*9 per cent. It may thus be seen that the recent epidemic of cholera with its heavy mortality follow ing as it did an unusually severe epidemic of small-pox, which alone carried away over 6,000 souls, has had a highly deleterious effect on the health of the Province, which, it is much to be regretted, is likely to suffer still further from an early visitation of plague should the epidemic, which is now raging in Maskat and Matrab, extend to the interior.

Trade, generally speaking, was stationary during the year 1899 It certainly was an improvement on that of 1898. but the improvement was not ns great as was at first anticipated, owing to failure of rain during the later part of the season. Ihe trade of these parts depends principally on the amount of the rainfall, as a good rainfall stimulates export of cereals and the consequent import of foreign goods. Sufficient rain has fallen this year everywhere, and an abnormal harvest is expected. Prices of food-stuffs were from 30 to 40 per cent, less in the vear under report than in 1898. Although the harvest for the year 1899 was much better than those of the last few years, the embargo on the export of grain continued throughout the year. Hie prohibition lias been detrimental to British firms, as, while natives are able to evade it under one pretext or another, Europeans are absolutely forbidden to buy or even to remove grain from one place in Persia to another. It is hoped that this unnecessary restriction will be removed during the current year. Currency. —Reference was made in last report to the debased state of the currency of the country. The inconvenience to which merchants were put on account of the unsatisfactory state of the currency has disappeared, to some extent, owing partly to the partial withdrawal of the objectionable and illegal notes called 'Bijecks'* which a native company had put into circulation in Bushire, in contravention of the monopoly granted by the Persian Government to the Imperial Bank of Persia. Customs House. —The management of, and arrangements for the protection of, meI'chants , goods at the Customs House unfortunately continue unsatisfac tory, but frauds and robberies have diminished since the punishment of the culprits involved in the fraudulent jettison of cargo S.S. Farran in 189S. MISCELLANEOUS. Exchange.—DMnvg the year 1899 fluctuations occurred in sterling exchange between the rates of 55 krans per pound and krans 52J per pound for bank paper. It touched its highest point in March and its lowest in August. The fluctuations have at no time during the year been at all violent. Rupee exchange has varied between krans 3*65 per rupee, at which it stood at the end of the year, and krans 3*45 per rupee for bank paper. Rupees in silver have fluctuated between the same limits. Specie, — Considerable quantities of rupees, sovereigns, Turkish pounds, Austrian dollars, and other coins have been imported, and exported from and to Aden, Bombay, Arabian and Red Sea ports. No reliable statistics under this head are unfortunately available, but the quantity which has come under notice amounts to Rl,10,92,900=£739,527. In addition to the above, bar silver to the value of about £60,000== 119,00,000 has been imported into Persia via Bushire during 1899. Mule-hire.— year opened at krans 100 per 100 maunds (775ibs) and rates were steady till the grazing season commenced, when a fall to krans 80 took place.

Both the imports and exports show an increase of S9,03 J 870 and R4)4,50,3l5, respec tively, over that of the previous year. The principal articles of import which shew an increase are—Candles, Drugs and Medicines Glass and Glassware, Matches, Loaf Sugar, Tea and Woollens. ' The following items have contributed towards improvement in exports, viz.. Cotton Almonds, Wheat, Gum, Opium, Rose-water and Silk. Imports. Candles. — Owing to the increased use of kerosine oil as an illuminant, the trade in candles was receiving a check, but the high price that ruled for the former article has helped in giving an impetus to the caudle trade. The candles are principally of Dutch manufacture. Coffee—Shews a falling off of R29,735, and business generally in this commodity has resulted in loss to those who had dealings in it. Cotton goods, — Heavy stocks up-country and a very sharp rise in price of cotton at home have acted adversely upon the imports for the year under report. Glass and Glassware. —Business in these articles is generally carried on by petty dealers on account of its unremunerative nature. Only cheap and showy articles are in demand. Indigo. —Import in this article shews a decrease of SI,92,810. This is due to high price ruling in India. Metals. —Copper, etc. Owing to enhanced prices in Europe imports were considerably less, and as the condition of the peasantry who are the largest purchasers is anything but satisfactory, indirectly due to embargo on export of grain, the trade in these articles will take some time before it can be revived. Kerosine Oil. —The trade in this article is practically a monopoly in the hands of a British Indian firm of Bombay. The returns shew a decrease of R4.1,440, but this is nominal, as it merely shews the value of the kerosine oil transhipped from Bushire to Bahrein without landing it in Bushire, as was done in the previous year. The price of this commodity which is imported from Russia ruled very high in the year under report and it once reached R8 per case. Porcelain and Chinatcare. —The trade in these articles is a losing one, chieflv due to breakage. Provisions and Oilman-siores. —The imports under this head shew a decrease of R5,04,475, which is due to a better harvest and consequently doing away with the necessity of import ing food stuffs from foreign countries. Sugar, Loaf. —Large quantities, especially French, of this article was impoited, and the business proved a remunerative one. A few parcels of Egyptian sugar were imported and Were easily disposed of. Tea —Is finding favor with the Persians in preference to coffee, and the year's operations shew an increase of R15,05,370.EES1DENCY AND MASK AT POLTTTpat Arm*T LniCAr ' AGENC Y FOE THE YEAl: 1899-1900. 97 Exports.

There is always a good demand m China for unadulterated opium. ^ Shells. Transactions in shells have proved disastrous to those who undertook them and unless more care is taken by shippers as to the quality of this commodity and the requirement of the market, the trade is not likely to improve. Seeds. Operations in linseed, poppy seed and lucerne-grass seed were profitable but in sesame seed no good result was obtained. ' Silk, —The principal centres of silk-producing districts are Khorassan and Resht, and the bulk of the produce is exported to Russia, but a comparatively small quantity finds its way to India and to Beyrout in Turkey. Wool —The export fell far short of the previous year, and although the clip of the year under report was of a better quality, the results were not satisfactory, and shippers are said to have lost 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. Carpets. —Shipments were unsatisfactory, chiefly due to a large stock of the previous year's export having remained unsold in London, Egypt and Turkey. C. A.

TRADE REPORT FOR MASKAT FOR 1899-1900. • f c,9 QO Rnn I n y ear v lnclu ding specie, is returned at $4 ,134 ,020 as agains § , 9,600 ior the preceding year, showing a decrease of $155,580. If we exc u e specie, regarding which reliahle figures are not procurable, there being no duty upon it, the decrease would be reduced to $107,580 according to information derived from the chief trading and banking firms in Maskat. Imports. Excluding specie, of which there is a decrease of $20,000, the value of the import trade shows an increase of $28,520 as compared with the preceding year. This^ is due chiefly to the Arms Trade with England in which there has been a considerable increase on last year's figures. Cereals, ghee and twist and yarn from Persia and wheat from Asiatic Turkey also contributed to the increase, while all the articles of import from India show a great falling off, amounting in all to $304,300 chiefly appearing under the head of Bengal rice, cereals and oils of all kinds. This decline is attributed to famine and consequent high prices in India. Exports. The exports show a decrease of $164,100 or excluding specie of $136,100. While there is a slight increase in mother o'pearls, and pearls to India and specie to Persia, there is a great decline in all the articles of export; dates which form the chief article of trade at Maskat made their way but slowly to the coast towns owing to the prevalence of cholera and plague, and conse quently a large stock remained with the producers at the end of the year. The same cause contributed to the decline in fish, fruit and specie to India and cotton fabrics to Zanzibar. Customs. A marked feature in the history of the Maskat Customs Administration is that this year the Sultan instead of farming out the customs as usual retained them under his own immediate control from the month of November 1899, when the Farm fell in.

Liquorice. Liquorice was exported to England from the Karun for the nrst time, but quality was found to be unsatisfactory. TFooZ.—-The wool was again inferior in quality and prices too hieh for the London market. I mports. The principal increase in imports was in cotton goods, and is due to increased purchases in the Mohammerah market for neighbouring districts both in Persia and Turkey and for Koweit. The principal demand and prices were as previously reported. They were nearly all of Manchester manufacture. A small consignment from Marseilles consisted of cotton tissue kerchiefs, an article only manufactured on the Con tinent ; these were imported previously, but not direct from Erance. Sugar, —Sugar again shows an increase, especially loaf. This article is carried by caravans to neighbouring provinces. It is chiefly Erench beet, but Egyptian loaf also shews an increase. Cane soft sugar has now been almost entirely replaced by beet. Prices rose at the end of the year about 3 per cent, and ranged from 65 to 75 krans per case of l^lbs. for loaf and from 55 to 65 krans per bag of cwt. for soft. JMatches, —Matches shew a marked increase due to purchases for. neigh bouring districts. They are all of Swedish manufacture. Price 180 krans for sulphur and 250 krans for safety per box of 40 gross. Date boxes. —^Materials for boxes for packing dates were imported from Trieste for the first time, but three-quarters of these were afterwards forwarded to Turkish territory. S hipping.

Preights to London ranged from 20 to 25 shillings per ton and to India from 8 to 24 shillings per ton. River. —The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company continued to run fortnightly to Bunder Nasri. This Company have a second steamer available should trade increase. Freights to Nasri about 10 and to Shushter about 18 shillings per ton. Agriculture. Wheat. —Owing to partial character of the spring rains, the wheat crop varied from total failure to unusually good. Taking the crop as a whole, it was an average one. Prices at Nasri ranged from 25 to 34 krans for 3J cwts.; the embargo, being strictly enforced at Nasri, caused prices at Mohammerah to rise to 26 krans for 1| cwt. Prospects for next crop are excellent, and a larger area than usual has been sown. Dates. —The date crop was unusually large, and prices correspondingly low, ranging from 7 to 12 krans per basket of 154 lbs.; a portion of the crop remains for shipment. Ghee. —Ghee returned to its normal price in March. Trade routes. Dizful-Khoremahad. —At the end of August the Governor-General of Arabistan and Luristan made arrangements for securing the safety of caravans between Dizful and Khoremabad, thus re-opening the direct route from the Karun to the north of Persia which had been closed for some years owing to the lawlessness of the tribes. Ahwaz-Ispahan. —The principal bridge over the Karun on the new Ahwaz- Ispahan mule road was finished on the 14th December, and this road is now practically finished. It consists of 18 stages, but by doubling short stages of 12 miles can be done in 15 days. The two routes from the Karun are therefore now open, and an increase of trade may be expected. Dizful. —There was a considerable increase in the caravan trade between Dizful and Mohammerah. Health.
