My view is that I should try case as District Magistrate since power to impose sentence up to two years unde_r Section 34 A (b) Code of Criminal Procedure is ample to deal with accused if convicted. As one American and one Canadian in custody ? and cannot find bail should be grateful if you could telegraph agreement with this view as soon as possible. 3.

I am to point out in this conne -tion that in accordance with the instructions of the Government of India regarding class ification of prisoners the prisoner in question is entitled to ’B* Class, as a person convicted Of an offence involving moral degradation or personal greed cannot be placed in glass 'a'. I am therefore to request that you will be so good as to specify the classification of the prisoner Mr. Charles Minnick to enable this Government td treat him accordingly. / 2. I am to add that the dates of conviction, of Mr. Charles Minnick viz. 4th July 1945 and of issue of the ’warr ant of committal against him (viz 26th August 1945) being different, it is presumed that the corn encement of the prisoner's sentence of one year*is to be calculated with effect from the date- of conviction i.e. 4th July 1945. This presumption may kindly be confirmed. Your obedient servant, S(j/- Illegible For Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political and Services Department.I have the honour to be, Sir, xxx fSz2\ Copy of a letter from the Consul General for the United States of America at Bombay No.3lO-GDL-ace., dated the 5th October, 1945* I refer to the recen* visit of Consul Laliont of my office to Mr. Charles BlivoOd Minnick, Jr,, an American citizen serving a sentence in the Yeravda Central Prison, Poona, as a result of conviction of theft by the Government of Bahrain. Mr. Minnick requests that his status be changed from '’B' Class, in which he has been placed provisionally, to 'A” Class. The class of his confinement was omitted from the warrant of committal in his case, and it would be appreciated if the change in his status could be’ arranged as soon as possible, Mr. Minnick also complains that the food given him at the prison is not suitable for _ a European and in this connection he alleges that he nes lost 45 rounds in weight since his arrest , six pounds of which have been lost since his arrival in the Yeravda Central Prison. If ? ! r. Mi 'nick is to be confined to a prison in India, it is believed that he should be given food to which he is accustomed and in appropriate quantities It would be appreciated if this could be arranged, and I would also appreciate a copy of a typical day’s menu of the food served to him. It should be pointed out that Mr. Minnick is not accustomed to Indian food and his health may be seriously endangered unless prompt steps are taken to ensure that his diet is appropriate to his*needs. Mr, Minnick believes that there was considerable irr egularity in his conviction and it is understood that the local courts have no jurisdiction in his case. If he wishes to have his conviction reviewed, information would be appreciated as to what authority such a request should be directed. This is a question upon which I must report fully to the Department of State at Washington | ' and I should appreciate your comment on the matter at the M earliest possible date. - iNO.8900/34-A Political and Services Department* Bombay Castle, 26th October, 1945.

Subject:- Ur. Charles Minnick, an American Subject. Sir, With reference to Mr. Donovan’s letter No.3lO/GDL:ace . dated the 5th October 1945, on the above subject, I am directed to state that as the prisoner named above was convicted by the Political ^gent, Bahrain, a reference is being made to him as to the appropriate class in which he should be placed here. As regards the complaint made by Mr. Minnick regarding the unsuitability of the food given to him in the prison, I am to say that Mr. Minnick has been provisionally treated as a ’B’ Class prisoner and is getting |■ j diet of that class as laid down in 1 the scale for meat- eaters, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. The food I J is cooked by Indian prisoners who have some knowledge of iljl cooking for Europeans and is the same as that given to A ; Class prisoners, the only difference being that A Class ! prisoners are entitled to supplement their food at their own cost. With reference to paragraph 3 of Mr. Donovan's letter, I am to add that it would be appropriate if you approached the Bahrain authorities in the matter through the Government of India, External Affairs Department, for wkixk whatever further details you may require with regard to Mr. Minnick’s conviction* F rom To Your obedient servant, Sd/-C.K.Maru For Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political and Services Department.18/172 'A ^D,Ko.927&gt;S . I enclose a copy of some correspondence between Bahrain and the Bombay Government regarding the treatment accorded to the prisoner Charles Minnick who was mentioned in Residency telegram No. T/419 dated the 1st September 1945. 2 9 I had always been under the impression that Yeravda was the normal jail for European prisoners and would be glad if this could be con firmed. I presume that American prisoners are nothing new in India, and that others have been confined there without any objection being raised by the State Department. The remark of the Bombay Government, however, that 'the food is cooked by Indian prisoners who have some knowledge of cooking for Europeans' coupled with the 'Scale No.II for meat-eaters' is not very encouraging. We do not want to do anything which will give the Americans a handle in criticising our treatment of their prisoners, and I would be glad if some enquiry could be made without disclosing the real object behind it. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bahrain, and making certain that the conditions in the local jail — where the prisoner claims to have lost forty pounds in weight — are not unreasonable in the circumstances.

I note that he was provided v/ith BAPCO water. 3. The medical officer does not regularly attend the jail, but he is always available if required. Minnick was actually asked if he wished to see a doctor and replied that he did not. 4. I have visited the jail and consider that the accommodation is, in fact, not severe enough for it consists of a furnished room as provided for the British Police Detachment together with a ceiling fan and electric lights. The sanitary and bathing arrangements are modern, and the exercise ground is a pleasant garden. 5.

Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No. T/744 of the 16th December, 1945. 2. Mr. Parker T. Hart in a recent visit intimated that the American Consul-General, Bombay, was interesting himself very closely in a petition from Minnick in which it is stated (a) that he was not given a fair txsdL trial because he had not received benefit of legal advice, (b) that the prosecution was based on evidence of men convicted themselves at past dates. He complained also of (c) losing weight (40 lbs.) here, and (d) in Indian prison where his health was being permanently impaired. 3. The Consul General asked Hart to enquire if (e) the charge brought against Minnick by BAPCO could be withdrawn, (f) if at this stage there is any machinery to obtain a remission of sentence, and (g) if he might be given a copy of the judgement. 4. Hart made it clear* that he did not wish to convey the impression that he was in sympathy with the petition because he understood that the trial had been conducted with scrupulous fairness. He only wanted material for reply to Bombay.

As regards (d) this is mainly Government of India matter but Bahrein Agency is interested for obvious reasons. As regards (e) I pointed out that the case was Bahrein State versus Minnick. Hart agreed that to consider the question of withdrawal or revision was out of the question. The United States Bombay Consul can have recourse to the codes in Bombay, BUSH HR E RESIDENCY.

As regards (g) I replied that we had already written to the Dhahran Vice-Consulate on the matter and asked Mr. Hart to write to me if he wished to re-raise it. If the letter arrives I shall refer to you for instructions for reply. 6. Hart said that he understood that Minnick had not engaged counsel as he did not wish to pay fees and that he was endeavouring now to alleviate punishment and make trouble free of cost to himself.

Political Resident, Bushire. 8th of January, 1946. Reference my Express Letter No. c/1140 dated the 27th of December, 1945, Hart has again approached me in connection with the above case. 2. With reference to my 3(f) he again asked if a remission or review was possible at this stage. I again pointed out that the code was available in Bombay but because of this very fact, and to avoid giving the impression of not co-operating with him, I informed him of the terms of the Code of criminal pro cedure 404 Note 2 last sentence, and said that if the convict preferred an appeal under this ruling it would be considered on its merits. 3. With reference to the question of loss of weight, Hart informed me that Minnic^s medical certificate given at the time of his engagement in the United States of America stated his condition to be normal and his weight 170 lbs. According to Hart the Yerwada prison medical authorities gave Minnick's weight as 164 lbs. on admission and his present weight as 158 lbs. Minnick, therefore, has lost 6 lbs. normal weight between the time of his employment in the States and his arrival at Yerwada. The loss may be attributable to many causes but having regard to the diet provided - and paid for - by BAPCO the views expressed in paragraph 5 of my Demi- Official letter No. ,c/1112, dated the 9th of December, 1945, hold good. * { Sd./- A.C.

B.M.’s Political Agent, exercising and invested with the powers of District Magis trate and Sessions Judge, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf. Re: Sec.491 Cr. P.C. THE ABOVE MENTIONED PETITIONER DO HEREBY HUMBLY PETITION AS FOLLOWS: I. The Petitioner, an American by birth, nationality and an American citisen has been convicted by the court of Sessions at Bahrein Island under Sec.381 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo one year's imprisonment. 2. The Petitioner submits that the Court of Sessions has no power as a court of original jurisdiction to try and convict the accused unless the same has been committed to it for trial. 3. The Petitioner being an American by birth and nationality and being an American by citizenship had a right to be tried by an American jury or a jury approved by him, and had furthermore a right to be defended by such counsel as he chose. The learned sessions court had not conceded any of these ordinary and ele mentary rights. \ 4. The learned Sessions judge is wrong in holding that because the Prosecution also had not the assistance of a lawyer therefore the defence need not complain about his hardship. The prosecution story is disclosed in the complaint and needs no lawyer. It is only the defence that does need any legal help and particularly in the case of the accused who being a foreigner must be deemed to be an utter stranger to the techni calities and abstruse procedure of Indian laws. 5. The Petitioner had claimed that he was an American and had submitted his claim within the meaning of sec.528-A of the Cr. P.C. but the claim, without any inquiry into its correctness , was rejected. The petitioner submits that this procedure is arbitrary as it has violated the fundamental rights conceded by the code to Americans. 6. The disparity between the facts of the case and law becomes still more grievously apparent on an examination of the charge against the petitioner. The charge was not proved to have come within the purview of the Section and the evidence was woefully lacking in that respect. The confession of the Petitioner has no significance when thelearned judge proceeded to take evidence despite the confession. 7. The Petitioner further submits that he has been committed by a Warrant which is ab initio invalid and his detention in custody illegal. The petitioner has been confined in Jail by a Warrant not signed by the Court passing the sentence. This the Petitioner submits violates the provisions of Section 383 of the Cr. P.C. and creates an incurable illegality which goes to the bottom of his continuation in prison. ) ) ) Respondents. ) )8. The Petitioner submits that under the circumstances his detention in prison is unjustified and illegal. The Petitioner therefore humbly prays that he/forthwith set at liberty. FOR WHICH ACT HE WILL EVER REMAIN GRATEFUL. Sd./- C.E.

Prisoners sentenced to penal servitude or long terms of imprisonment are as a matter of course committed to imprisonment in Bombay. I have been.unable to trace any general order'made by the P.R. under Article 17 (l) of the Bahrain Order in Council and I have called from M.O. for papers on this point. In the meantime, in view of ^•2 , &gt;j # Ik k has been repeated 'Immediate^ to Khorrarashahr for P.R. 2 -—para 2. The correspondence regarding the value to nmerleans of Cessions Court procedure is contained in c. 20 , PI 5 33, 37 and 43 of file 13/261* In this case, however, no departure is being made from the ordinary oroc- edure of the law. The offence is one which, under schedule II of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Sohoni, Cch. II p. 38-A) can be tried by a Magistrate of the First Class. In order to try it as District Magistrate the Political Agent is not invoking his special powers under King’s Regulation 2 of 1930. There seems no reason, there fore, why the law should not take its ordinary course despite American susceptibilities and the fact that a Canadian British subject is being treated similarly leaves the Americans little ground for complaint. S. Z para 5. It is not quite clear why conviction and imprisonment in India under the ordinary law in force should raise the question of our jurisdiction over Americans in an acute form. Some time or another a case was bound to crop up, and the fact that in this case we have a Canadian British subject being tried equally with an American citizen makes it all the better for us. 10. ///^//■^ It is doubtful whether it is worth while passing on to P.B. any comment as in para 9 as he will 'find it difficult to arrive at a decision without papers. It s eems preferable merely to inform him, repeating to P.A Bahrian, that papers will be kept ready for his decision N pa ras 9.,&amp; 10 * We have heard nothing further of the Amaiii^s^a11itude towards the general question of the trial of their nationals after Serial 43 of with the position but their satisfaction - if it exists was probably largely induced by the- prospect of serious cases being tried with the assistance of American jurisdiction issue will not become so acute if the case is tried by a Sessions Court. Further this delay would give the accused an opportunity to obtain a legal representative from India if they wished. The inevitable delay and the period the accused will have to spend in custody in Bahrain.. clear that the sentence would have to be served in India. The Political Agent anticipates that the case will 14. end in conviction. If it is desired to avoi&lt;{ raising the jurisdiction issue through this case the only course would be for the Bahrain Government to drop the complaint. To do this would certainly lead to justifiable allegations that Americans and Canadians were not subject to the ordinary; law. on his return here on the 22nd. assessors. For this reason it seems probable that the disadvantage is as pointed out by Political Agent, the k If the accused are convicted u/s 381 I.P.C. the Magistrate must sentence them to imprisonment and it is 13.aL 2% ai.

This is rather a problem as we do not know at which Jail or prison European or American prisoners are ordinarily imprisoned, and under Sec. 384 of the Criminal Procedure Code the Warrant should be directed to the Officer in charge of the jail. We may telegraph to the Government of Bombay enquiring, and ask them to repeat their reply to P.A., Bahrair Para 4. This ma ^ be done ? Para 5.

Repetition of paragraph 4 has been asked for. There seems little point in refusing to give the American Vice-Consul copies of the proceedings when the prisoner is entitled to them and the ¥ice-Consul can obtain them through the prisoner. In view of the absence of lawyers and the fact that the Vice-Consul is holding a watching brief on behalf of the prisoner it could perhaps be held that he is a person affected by the judgement within the meaning of Section 548. On receipt of repetition asked for P.A. Bahrain may be informed ^ as above13/172 11 S 18. Perhaps we might now telegraph to P.A. saying tnat as sufficient time has now elapsed for prisoner to decide whether he v/ill obtain a lawyer from India either to prepare his appeal, and/or to assist him at its hearing, the question should be put to him, and he should be informed that if he has taken no steps towards making such arrangements he will be committed to serve his sentence in Yeravda 0 hrhjU*cjL 1*- / of India in continuation of S 19, the gist of S 23 and S 26 ?
