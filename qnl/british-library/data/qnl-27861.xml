CONFIDENTIAL. (15418) f p '7 5448 ^ 1333 J June 11, 1938. Section 1. [E 3469/2478/91] Copy No. Note on Petroleum Developments in the, Arabian Peninsula. (Prepared in the Petroleum Department, June 1938.)— (Received in Foreign Office, June 11.) General. FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Included in this area are the following States, sheikhdoms or territories, in most of which petroleum concessions have been, or are likely to be, obtained :— (A) Under British sovereignty or protection— Koweit. Bahrein. Qatar. Trucial Sheikhdoms— Ajman. Abu Dhabi. Debai. Ras-al-Khaimah. Sharjah. Umm-al-Quwaim. Aden Colony. Aden Protectorate. (B) Independent States— Saudi Arabia— (i) Red Sea Area. (ii) Nejd— (d) Hasa. (5) Remainder of Nejd. The Yemen. Muscat and Oman^ 1 ) (C) Miscellaneous— Koweit Neutral Zone. Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 2. As Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are interested in the majority of the above-mentioned territories it has been thought worth while to include'in this summary a short note on the genesis and composition of the company. 3. The company, which was first registered in October 1935, is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the change of name was decided upon in order to facilitate the securing of concessions outside Iraq. The whole of the shares in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the boards of the two companies are similarly composed, except that the Board of Petroleum ( l ) His Majesty’s Government exercise by custom only a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 9918 [330 1—1] BConcessions (Limited) does not include an Iraqi Government Director. Lord Cadman is chairman of both companies. The shareholding of the Iraq Petroleum Company is divided as follows :—- Percentac British— Anglo-Iranian Oil Company 23-75 Dutch— Royal Dutch Shell 23 -75 French— Compagnie Francaise des Petroles ... ... 23-75 American— Near East Development Company (i.e., Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum in the proportion of 50-50) 23 -75 Participation and Investments (Limited)— C. S. Gulbenkian ... ... ... ... ... 5-00 100-00 Koweit. 4. The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement^ 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan, south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair C onference of November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived M between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit. to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies. I etroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed by the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position in respect of Ibn Saud’s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received in regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 24-28 below). Bahrein. i n Bahrein is being undertaken by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (Limited) under a lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 29th December, 1934, and modified on the 3rd June. 1936. The lease covers practically the whole of the Island of Bahrein, and runs for a period of fifty-five years from the 1st January, 1935. Up to the end of 1937 58 wells had been drilled or were about to be drilled, 33 were producing, and 14 were shut-m Production during 1937 amounted to approximately 1,108,894 tons. ( ) Hy Political Agreement is meant in this memorandum an agreement between the concessionary company and His Majesty’s Government, to which the Ruler concerned is usually an assenting party, by which the company undertakes not to transfer the concession to non-British interests and to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government generally.RMROMIIRM 3 9. Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their lease, have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without ^ definite result. 10 The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929, the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oil Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Sand’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Trucial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows : — 14 A jman. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years. The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938, but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. 15. Abu Dhabi. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this territory for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 22nd May, 1937, and Political Agreement dated the 5th February, 1937). No work has so far been carried out. 17. Ras-al-Khaimah. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 1st August, 1937. A political agreement, preceding the conclusion of a commercial agreement, was signed on the 25th March, 1938. Negotiations for the latter are in suspense. 18. Sharjah. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this area for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 17th September, 1937; Political Agreement signed the 12th November, 1937). 19. Umm-al-Quwaim. —No option or concession has yet been obtained in respect of this territory, but the sheikh recently informed Petroleum Concessions (Limited) that he was “ willing to negotiate.” Aden Protectorate. 20. An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory has been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been recommended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of two years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in respect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft of the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1—1] b 24 company, and sent to the Governor for consideration. In the meantime, Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an exploration party to the Protectorate (see also note under “ Muscat and Oman ’). Saudi Arabia: (i) Red Sea Area. 21. The petroleum rights in this area were granted to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 9th July, 1936. The concession runs for a period of sixt) \ears and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to a depth of 100 kilom. (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters). Prospecting work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) —the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) but with the exception of the Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the results have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) Nejd. 22. (a) Hasa .—The oil rights in this area were conceded to the Standard Oil Company of California by Ibn Saud on the 27th May, 1933. The con cession has since been transferred to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of w T hich is wholly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally. The concession runs for a period of sixty years. The area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows :• “All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahiein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a poi t on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied bv the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa aiea concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “ secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25 Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California— “a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area {i.e., the Hasa concession area) as the contact betw^een the sedimentary and igneous formations.” His Maiesty’s Government are not at present aware whether or where this “ contact line ” has been established. There is presumably an area uncovered by any concession or preference rights between the “ contact line,”' wherever that may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession.27. A further provision is that the Standard Oil Company of California shall have the right to recover “by means of deductions from one-half of the royalties due to the Government' the amount of two loans totalling £50,000 gold received by the Saudi Arabian Government from the company. | 28. On the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters *were exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the company’s preference rights in regard to {a) “ the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia” referred to in paragraph 26 above, and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil Company of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company’s offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. The Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how ever, been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months. Muscat and Oman. 30. Two concessions^) have been obtained from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), one in respect of Muscat and Oman except the district of Dhofar and the other in respect of Dhofar. Both commer cial agreements are dated the 24th June, 1937, and run for a period of seventy- five years. The Sultan at first showed himself averse from being associated in any way with any political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the company. This question was, however, discussed with the Sultan during his visit to this country in April of this year, and the Sultan in the end agreed to be associated with such an agreement in a modified form. 31. An aerial exploration which it is hoped to carry out in the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate will probably include the western portion of Muscat and Oman. Refinery Agreement with Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 32. A general Refinery Agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 5th February, 1937. Briefly, the agreement provides that whenever the production of crude oil in the areas over which the company hold, or may hold, oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the company shall erect, on a site to be agreed, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons per annum, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations. The agreement also provides for a re-examination of the question of the refinerv capacity in the event of the total annual production exceeding ] million tons per annum. Pre-enrvption of Oil in the Event of an Emergency. 33. The political agreements entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and Petroleum Concessions (Limited), in respect of the concessions secured by the company in Qatar, Debai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, provide, inter alia, that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of which His Majesty’s Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty’s Govern ment shall have the sole right of pre-emption of all crude oil obtained under the concessions and of all the products thereof. His Majesty’s Government have also the right to require the company to the extent of any refining capacity it may have ( 8 ) A separate concession may be granted by the Sultan later for his Asiatic territory, i.e., (twadur.in each State (but see the preceding paragraph defining the refinery position) to produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the time, provided that the oil is of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose, and to take control of the company’s works, plant and premises. Similar provisions appear in the political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the^ Koweit Oil Company. In the case of Muscat and Oman pre-emption will not™ be provided for in the modified form of political agreement with which the Sultan will be associated (see note under Muscat and Oman above) but in a separate agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 34. No political agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the concession in Bahrein (nor is pre-emption provided for in the lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein), but in view of the sheikh’s special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government it is not anticipated that any difficulty would occur in securing the pre-emption of Bahrein oil in the event of an emergency.
