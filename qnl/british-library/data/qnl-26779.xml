Sir, I have the honour to refer to your predecessor’s despatch No, 75 of the 27th April, 1936, regarding the regulations relating to the import, sale and possession of anas in Saudi Arabia. 2. No information has been received of any incidents attributable to the enforcement of the regula tions beyond the general excitement mentioned in paragraph 220 of the Hoyal Air Force Monthly Summary of Intelligence for December, 1935, and the annoyance of members of the Beni Atiya and Anaiaa tribes at the indignity of handing in their anas when they enter towns, reported in paragraph 83 of the Royal Air Force Weekly Summary of Intelligence dated the 12th March, 1936. 3. The situation will continue to be watched as suggested by His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, in paragraph 5 of his despatch No. 47 of the 12th February, 1936. Copies of those two paragraphs are enclosed herein. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Arthur Wauchope. High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan. The Right Honourable W.G.A. Ormsby Gore, P«C., M.P., His Majesty’s Principal secretary of State for the Colonies#Extract from Air Headquarters Monthly Summary of rt Intelligence”, Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the month of December. 1935. Early in November, the Government published legislation prohibiting the import and sale of aims and ammunition, and restricting the possession and carrying of all firearms (other than sporting guns) in Saudi Arabia. The new regulations do not affect the military or police, but prohibit private persons from possessing or carrying firearms and from carrying swords and daggers in any of the towns, seaports or villages in the kingdom. Those in possession of firearms are ordered to hand them over to the police within one month. (This does not include shot guns which are subject to separate regulations.) Certain Government officials will be provided with licences exeiapting them from the regulations, but the licences must be renewed annually and are valid only while the holder retains his official position. The regulations do not apply to bedouin resident in the desert, but when such persons enter a town or village they must give up their arms to the nearest police post, against a detailed receipt, and on leaving the arms may be recovered on production of the receipt. punishments for contravention of these regulations include confiscation of the arms and a fine equal to the value of the arms and imprisonment if the case concerns firearms. For carrying swords or daggers. thethe offenders will have the weapons confiscated and will receive a warning for a first offence, and imprisonment for subsequent offences. These regulations have now reached the outlying districts and are causing widespread discontent. Information from Wejh indicates that the inhabitants arc hiding their arms in order to evade handing them over. There is also excitement amongst the people of Tebuk and the surrounding villages, and much talk of forcible resistance to Government officials who may attempt to give effect to the regulations. Whatever the outcome may be there is every probability that the enforcement of the arms prohibition will cause the Government a considerable amount of trouble.Extract from Air Headquarters Weekly sumaaiy of 'Intelligence'.

The same objections as was explained in the case of Bahrain in my Express Letter c/79 February 17th apply in the case of the Trucial Coast. I doubt if much will be heard of the Arms Regulations except in the case of tribesmen going to Hofuf; but the Regulations may, of course, be turned into an instrument of imposing the influence of Bin Sa* ud on those tribes who move into Sa’udi limits from Qatar and Abu Dhabi territory. I should, however, recommend letting the matter be unless and until complaints are received. To make representa tions now would, I venture to think, only put ideas into the head of Bin Sa^d and his lieutenants. sd. Gr.

It provides for a system of licences, and although technically the list of persons authorised to carry arms (see Article 7) is limited to official persons, ‘ it appears from a subsequent Article, No.16, that migrant tribesmen e^wanot in fact be disarmed. The Articles which are of direct interest to us are Nos.16 and 17. They lay down a differentiation of treatment between the tribesmen of Saudi Arabia and those of neighbouring countries. The latter are required to deposit their arms at a frontier post, the former only on entry into a town, and it was therefore felt that the natives of such neighbouring states as Koweit or the Trucial Sheikhdoms might be at a disadvantage when journeying into the interior of Saudi Arabia. ln/&amp; . f The political Resiaent was asked to give his views on this aspect of the Regulations and his reply will be found at P.Z.2052. Koweit appears to be the state most likely to be affected and Captain de Gaury’s comments are therefore of interest. The Sheikh himself is satisfied that no hardship is entailed, because, in his opinion, it would be impossible for the Saudi Government to enforce the Regulations in N.E.Arabia. This is probably true, but it is possible that if a solution of the question of the Saudi Blockade is reached in the near future ch^f ective frontier posts will, in fact, be established on the Koweit-Saudi frontier and it would therefore be possible for Saudi officials to enforce the Regulations against Koweiti subjects. The Regulations have, however, now been in force for some months and no differentiation in/ 3939 5000 7/35in treatment has so far resulted. It seems therefore unnecessary to raise any objections to the Regulations, more especially as any extension of control by the Central Government in N.E.Arabia is to be encouraged rather than the reverse, as Captain de Gaury points out. The other Sheikhdoms are probably only indirectly concerned. Muscat is too far distant; very few Bahrainis visit the interior of Saudi Arabia and the same probably applies to the Trucial Sheikhdoms. It is submitted therefore that we should concur in the course proposed by the Foreign Office and confine our action to instructing Colonel Fowle to watch the situation and report any incidents which may be attributable to the enforcement of these Regulations.Draft Paper F.Z.2102/36 Department 4o9!) ) 5000 2.36 DRAFT U.S.S., F.O. ^-TruU &lt;h Uu q *') 'US', /fn y k&lt;*i A-' h 11 7* ** ir n^u I ^ o+J)*'* ^ .

On further consideration I am Impressed b 5 three facts, as follows:- (a) Ibn Sand’s general policy is fundamentally, though cautiously, hostile t© the oerpetuatim ©f the old tribal system. He has aimed at creating a sax Saudiana and ha ha$ hcd considerable euceees in certain a?eae, most notably perhaps in the central portions of th 3 Hajez. in theeo areas tribesmen may still carry arms, for t* carry arms ie a matter of lt ie doubtful whether .he arms are absolutely necessary for self preservation^ In remoter and wilder areas, ■whe need must obviously be greater, but Ibn Saud may be convinced that he is now strong enough to extend his system of are made In this country, thanks to hs passion of the more modern-minded of Ibn Samd (i s advisers for making laws, which have so little relation to th© condi ions of the country that they produce very little effect* M: first inclination ©a vo be seriously enforced, except nerlt aps in the 1 security even in such areas. /(■b) Th© Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M 0 C ; , f W C V ©tCo , etCc , etCo(b) There hes been a recent tendency to sceentuete the control of the centre!

I would offer the following observations:^ / / (a) I see nothing remarkable in :he provisions of Article ? of the regulation, having regard to tie conditions of a country in which every high personage has hie re tinue @f retainerSo Any prince or governor for instance who m s not attended by armed men of this kind* would be put to shame md would fail to inspire respect for his authorityo (b) As regards the point raised .n paragraph 4 of your despatch, I have had the translation of irticle 9 of the regulations cheeked and am told that it .a correct* The conclusion would appear to be t hat the d ‘after of the regulation was unwilling to contemplate any eerryin : of arms by noa-Saudls and therefore provided that persons applying for permits must provide /■positivepesitiva pr«of of Saudi nationality. This may ha th® modernist touch, based on the assumption, so dea ’ to Syrians and others with legal minds, that every one has a nati mality and should be able to prove It; or it may be one of the lany devices adopted in rt ft country to force as many people ei possible to accent Saudi nationality, ’ ' 3 *''■ * : F :, 9 S My .weant to safeguard the ev •.-.eying t .r arms by Saudi tribearaen in the open country but I am so', sure what is meant by ''and others' ini ess it i e intended to J-. j,. . t .\&gt; ejtestipitj: e.g, in the ease of travelling merchants, who need to carry arms no less than tr hesmen. It may be said that such persons should take out lice, ees bafore starting on a donrney but muddled thought is frozen in the drafting of Saudi regulatlonso base to tne most difficult qv stion raised in your d.espatch, that of the combined effect 't Articles IB m a ig 0 f the regulations.

Only experience can show whether the practical effect l! ‘ n r ®gblatione, having regard to wt at I have said in paragraph 2 {a) above, corresponds with the logical conclusion.. In any ease 1 think it would be difficult to take the matter up with the Saudi Government, without feaviig concrete evidence that the operation of the regulations was in fact seriously die- advantageous to tribes from a djoinlng cmntries.

As far as the Persian Gulf is concerned my comments are as follows. 3. (a) Muscat . This State is too far removed from Saudi Arabia to be affected* (b) Bahrain . Loch points out the differentiation between natives of Saudi Arabia and foreigners under Articles XVI and XVII of the Regulations i.e. a Saudi tribesman will only give up his arms at the first guard police station in the locality, while a foreigner at the first desert police station in the frontier zone. A foreigner may therefore have to proceed on his way unarmed in dangerous areas. However, Bahrainis do not visit the interior of Saudi Arabia in any large numbers so presumably this will not affect them very much. (c) True ial Coast . I am asking Loch for his opinion as to the effect of the Regulations on the Trueial Coast and will let you know when I have received his reply. (d) Kuwait .

His excellency read the / Regulations when they appeared in Unsm ul ^ura in October i and although they are announced as coming into force from the date of publication no change in practice has taken place. 2 # In the case of the towns it has long been customary to leave arms at their gates, which is often also convenient to the carriers of the arms themselves as well as reassuring to the authorities. It is the existing rule in Kuwait to do so. assuming that the shaikh is correct in thinking that the Regulations are not enforceable in this area, then n i &gt; -7 tS * this agency has no comment. If alternatively security in the desert were to change so much for the better, implying a closer mesh to Baudi *orab authority which hardly seems practicable in the open deserts of Lorth Last ^rabia there could also be no objection to the enforcement of the i&gt;audi ^rab Regulations from Kuwait. __________________! ,&gt; ' 'mmm - 2 - 4.

The regulations were all published in the Saudi newspaper Umm al Qura [Umm al-Qurá], and consist of the following: a high decree published 15 May 1931 (folios 43-45); a high order sanctioned by the Legislative Assembly, 8 Safar 1352 [2 June 1933] (folios 39-40); and a regulation issued by Ibn Sa'ūd ['Abd al-Raḥmān bin 'Abd al-'Azīz bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd] on 3 Shabān 1354 [31 October 1935] (folios 29-34).The file also includes correspondence between HM Minister at Jedda (Andrew Ryan), the Foreign Office, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle), the Political Agent at Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch), the Political Agent at Kuwait (Captain Gerald Simpson Hillairet de Gaury), and the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan (Arthur Wauchope), discussing: the impact of the regulations on tribesmen from Transjordan, Kuwait and the Trucial Coast; the difficulties of enforcing the regulations in the hinterlands; and concerns that Ibn Sa'ūd intended to use the regulations to impose his influence on tribes who moved into Saudi limits from Qatar and Abu Dhabi.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references found in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002e3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
