It has been found that an attempt to catalog the large stocks of inactive supplies is too great a task for our reduced staff. We have, for example, a surplus of something like: 50,000 feet 2' Threaded line pipe 70,000 « 3' n 35,000 M 4’* n 7,500 ft 4' Special coupling, portable pipe 17,000 ft 6' 127,000 ft Insulated copper wire and cable various sizes, types, end cover# We have also sufficient lumber, millwork, lighting and plumb ing fixtures, and hardware to build thirty two-bedroom houses, including 1,500,000 feet of lumber; and portable sectional buildings to make up a 40-man camp complete with messhall, kitchen and recreation buildings, but less the air condition ing equipment for which these buildings were designed. There are many other items in similar amounts, and thus you can understand that a complete description would be volunnous. I estimate that we could release well over $500,000 worth of supplies and equipment including transportation equip ment# This we are prepared to sell for payment in dollars, 'JJ#3. Currency. Enclosed is a summary of transportation equipment which we can offer. This summary gives a description of the equipment and an analysis of its present condition. The prices are contained in a separate attachment. It would be impossibleto list the spare parts and tires that oould be made avail able also, because the amount depends on the equipment taken by you. I realize that this letter does not give the com plete information that you desire, but as stated above, it would require considerable time and man power to work up descriptions of the hundreds of items that might be made available. I suggest that you or your representative come to Dhahran to see what we have, and we can work out prices according to the items selected. Yours very truly, ORIGINAL SIGNED BY E . W. Ohliger F. W.

In the telegrams which we exchanged with Mr. Bowlby and in the conversations held by our representative to the Petroleum Advisory Consnittee, Mr. Snyder, we pointed out that our permission to release any of this material was granted under the condition that it would only be used to fulfill an urgent requirement. Our San Francisco principals have stressed this point many times in their correspondence and instructions to us. Under these circumstances, I hesitate to release the material for storage at Abadan, and I believe that it will be advisable to discuss this problem in detail with Mr. Bridgeman when he arrives in Bahrein. I have recently advised Mr. Reynolds that we shall be pleased to have Mr. Bridgeman visit with us provided he is able to arrange his own entry into Saudi Arabia.

You or some other designated British Authority will arrange lighterage and shipment. The cost of light ering and shipment to India is to be handled directly by British Authorities. GM-87&amp; to Grey Mackenzie (copy to you) in which we advised them that the materials would weigh 310 short tons. Our purpose in writing that letter was simply to warn them of the nunber of barges required when you asked for them, inasmuch as all the figures given in our correspondence bade and forth had been in feet of tubing and line pipe without giving the necessary weights. Our letter of ^October 7 to you did indicate that we would ask Grey Mackenzie for intention was only to be as helpful as possible, and not to change the basic responsibility given above. 1. We will prepare the materials for shipment, including necessary marking, haul it to A1 Khobar pier, and load undoubtedly confused the issue by our letter barges when you advised us that shipment was to be made, but ourThe state of present confusion was indicated by a note just received from Mr. Reynolds in which he advised that Major Hewitt had called at his office to find out how soon we we£e going to send these materials over to Bahrein. Actually, we have received no instructions to send the materials over, have no facilities for doing so, and as we understand your letter C/1613 and letter S/14/6/3^-^7 from HQ Movement Control at Basra, the arrangements for loading f these materials on board ship and collecting the charges therefore are ertirely in the hands of Major Hewitt. We understand that Grey Mackenzie are somewhat short of barges to handle our materials together with the materials to go forward on the same ship from Qatar and Bapco. However, as much as we would like to help with our limited marine equipment, we are in a poor position at the moment to do so, as our only flat barge is on loan to Bapco for work important to the war effort, and we believe it would be difficult for them to release it. Vie might load 50 to 60 tons on our pile driver barge, but this is a very poor piece of equipment for lighterage purposes, and its use should be avoided if at all possible. We tmst that you will take the necessary steps to clarify the above policy, which we would expect to apply also on any future shipments of materials to British Military Authorities, and to make the best possible arrangements for handlir^ the specific shipment at hand.

In regard to handling charges at Bahrain, those charges which are incurred by the Town Major will be re covered from the consignees through the War Office. Handling charges, if any, incurred by the Company should, I suggest, be communicated through me to Mr, Bowlby who is presumably In a position to recover them from the con signees. 4. Major Hewitt was sent by Q.H.Q. PAIFORCE a copy of the orders quoted in my letter No.C/1613 dated 24th October 1942. Those orders appear to contemplate that handling charges at Bahrain would be incurred by the Military Authorities rather than by the Company, and if this could be done claims by the Company other than for the cost of the material would be avoided. I regret that as I am leaving Bahrain for a short tour almost at once I have been unable to contact Major Hewitt, but I suggest that discussion with him on the lines indicated above would resolve your difficulties.

Bolted Tanks For Military Authorities Mr. E. B. Wakefield His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Bahrein Island Persian Gulf Dear Mr* Wakefield: ('■&gt; J z** ■ t ^ please refer to our letter of December 2 in regard to the release of a 3,000 barrel bolted tank for the military authorities. We are now pleased to advise that we have received approval to release the three 2,000 barrel bolted secondhand crude oil gathering tanks to the British authorities, contrary to the statement made in our letter of December 2 that such approval was not expected. These tanks were used in sour crude oil service for approximately two years and so are not in good condition. The under side of the roofs and roof supports are rather severely corroded, although to the best of our knowledge the roofs are tight and structurally sound. The shells are in fair con dition. The bottoms in these particular tanks are still the original bolted bottoms and are severely corroded. There are a number of leaks through these bottoms and we had been planning to install new welded steel bottoms in returning the tanks to our own service. It will be necessary for the British authorities to do considerable patching of these bottoms or to completely replace them before they can be placed in service. We are attaching six copies of a requisition form covering these three tanks, which we should like to have you or the proper authority approve and return two copies to us. We anticipate tiiat these three tanks will be ready for shipment in not mo^e than three weeks from the time we receive your advice that the British author- 1 es still require them. W T e believe there is not much question on this point as Mr* Snyder was advised at the December meeting of the Petroleum Advisory Committee that these tanks were very urgently needed. Nevertheless we should still like to receive your confirmation of this purchase at your earliest convenience. The 5,000 barrel tank is now about ready for shipment but the local authorities advise that they still have not received permission to export it. Mr. Bird, the British Minister, had originally taken the view that the export of this tank was covered in the blanket authority previously received for materials required by the British military authorities. Local government officials took another view, however, and said they could not permit export of this tank without specific approval. Y*e have advised Mr. Likely, British Consul who has replaced Mr. Bird, to this effect, and to the best of our knowledge he is working on the export permit. We have also advised him to obtain export approval, if possible, for the three 2,000 barrel tanks at the same time. We will advise you as soon as we receive further information on these export approvals. It would probably be advisable, however, for you or Mr. Bowlby to follow the matter of obtaining export approvals, through diplomatic channels.
