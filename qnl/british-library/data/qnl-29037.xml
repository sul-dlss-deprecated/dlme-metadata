( P 144/144/150) Confidential• Sir, FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.J.I. 7th March, 1533, you I have to inform Your Excellency that I have recently you received reports f^on various non-official sources regarding the dangerous and growing effects of Soviet broadcasts vhieh can be heard in tho T ear and the Middle East, These broad casts are said to be sent out in Arable, Perion or other languages spoken in the Middle East, and to be devoted largely to Soviet propaganda. It is stated that it is difficult to obtain programmes which are not somewhat anti- British in tone, 2* It is a, matter for consideration whether it is desirable or posux^Ic to take steps to counteract this SovietSoviet propaganda. The only feasible rrethcd of doing so would appear to be by broadcasting from a station or stations under British control or influence whose programmes could be heard in the countries in question and could be given in a language comprehensible to the natives of these countries. The question whether such a station is available or could be made available is being further examined. It ie clear that if such a policy were adopted the greatest care would have to be exercised in carrying it out. By the Propaganda Agreement with the Soviet Government Kis Majesty’s Government are bound to abstain from anything which the Soviet Government axe could object to as being political propaganda. So far as Egypt is concerned the Egyptian Government have undertaken to prevent the use of their broadcast service as on instrument of political propaganda against any foreign State or its nationals. At the same time it dfces re* appear probable that tendencious reports froro Soviet Stations could be usefully countered by giving accurate and objective news on the same subjects, e,nd that the spread of Bolshevik influence and propaganda skeia would, undoubtedly be hampered by broadcast talks on current events or topics of general interest which were not coloured by the Bolshevik mentality. The messages sent out by the British Official Wireless Service might form a useful basis for such noH-tendencious news. 3- Before considering the matter further, I should be glad if you would inform me (l) whether Soviet riroad/oaste are widely received in the country in which you reside, and, if so, from what stations ( 2 ) whether such broadcasts are specially directed to the country in which you reside and are delivered in the language of that country: (3) whether such broadcasts are influential and dangerous, or likely to become so: (4)/-3- (4) Whether you consider it important and useful that broadcasts of the kind outlined in the preceding paragraph should, if possible, be undertaken to counteract Soviet btoadcasts; or whether you have any alternative suggestions to offer, bearing in mind the limitations on action explained in paragraph 2 abovej (5) If so, whether there are any special considerations to be borne in mind from the local point of view. ( 6 ) (To Tairo only) whether you consider it advisable and feasible to enlist the assistance of the Broadcasting Authorities in Egypt for the purpose suggested. (to all) 4 .

To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Subject:- Soviet Broadcasting in the Hear and Middle East. MEMORANDUM Please refer to your covering memorandum Ho.363-S dated 8th April 1933. 2. With regard to the points raised in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office despatch under reference, I hove to reply os follows:- (l) Soviet broadcasts ore received in Muscat by those who have the means to do so. These usually emanate from Moscow and some other Soviet stations the names of which I cannot ascertain. The language usually is Russian al though sometimes English and Arabic is reported to have been beard. (2) The messages do not appear to be addressed to any country in particular. (3) The number of the persons here owning radio re ceiving sets are 5 at present. Even so,however, some of these broadcasts might cause mischeiif. One of them recently drew a comparison between conditions ofi a Soviet oil tanker and those on a capitalist one during the course of a voyage. As they went along the speaker point ed out the graveyards and ruined towns while passing the Dardanelles, telling the audience that this was the doing of the British and that the British ought to re build the town. (4) Very clear broadcasts are received from the Indiar Broadcasting Coy. in Bombay but of course os very few people understand English here it would be more appre ciated if Arabic broadcast could be given. (5) I do not think there ore any particular localconeideratione to be borne in mina pr.
