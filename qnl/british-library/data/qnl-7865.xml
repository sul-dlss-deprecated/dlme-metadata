The amount of detail for each entry therefore varies.The letters from the Governor General (folios 120-128) discuss a request from Dost Mahomed [Dost Mohammad Khan, Amir of Afghanistan] for an audience with a representative of the Government of India to discuss Herat, and a decision by the Government of India to grant a temporary subsidy to Dost Mahomed to facilitate operations against Persia. They also cover British preparations for war against Persia, and a defence of Commander James Felix Jones (Political Resident, Persian Gulf) for his dismissal of British staff officers from Bushire. The carelessness displayed at Bombay in packing arms for Cabool [Kabul], and financial aid for Herat are also discussed.The section from Bombay (folios 129-131) includes arrangements for an expedition against Persia, and details (in terms of troops and ships) of the composition of the force.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Afghanistan</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Herāt</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Persian War (1856-1857)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049910361.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
