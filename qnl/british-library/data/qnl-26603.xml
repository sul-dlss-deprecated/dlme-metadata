The green and brown lines represent boundaries proposed by the British Government and the lines in pencil represent other considered boundary lines. The outermost line, drawn in red crayon, is marked as 'Ibn Saud's [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] Red Line'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100049623112.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
